</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondents have a calculated length of stay greater than 11 days and do not have a medical condition of 'Asthma'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find which respondents have a length of stay greater than 11 days and do not have a medical condition of 'Asthma'. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The responses are in RDF format, with each respondent having various predicates like pred:Date_of_Admission, pred:Discharge_Date, and pred:Medical_Condition. 

The key steps are:
1. Calculate the length of stay for each respondent by finding the difference between Discharge Date and Admission Date.
2. Check if the length of stay is greater than 11 days.
3. Ensure the respondent's medical condition is not 'Asthma'.

Looking at the medical conditions first. The schema for QMedical_Condition lists options as A. Arthritis, B. Asthma, C. Cancer, D. Diabetes, E. Hypertension, F. Obesity. So, the code ""b"" corresponds to Asthma. I need to exclude any respondent with pred:Medical_Condition ""b"".

Next, calculate the length of stay. Each respondent has Admission and Discharge dates in YYYY-MM-DD format. I'll need to parse these dates, compute the difference in days, and check if it's over 11.

Let's go through each respondent:

1. **Respondent142**:
   - Admission: 2019-11-06
   - Discharge: 2020-02-09
   - Calculating the days between these dates. From November 6 to February 9. November has 30 days, so 30 - 6 = 24 days in November. December has 31, January 31, then February 9. Total: 24 + 31 +31 +9 = 95 days. That's way over 11.
   - Medical Condition: ""b"" which is Asthma. So this one is excluded.

2. **Respondent75**:
   - Admission: 2021-02-12
   - Discharge: 2021-01-26. Wait, discharge date is before admission? That can't be right. Maybe a typo? Let me check again. The admission is 2021-02-12 and discharge is 2021-01-26. That's impossible, discharge is a month before admission. This must be an error in the data. So the length of stay would be negative, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps this respondent is invalid or there's a data entry mistake. Since the discharge is before admission, the length is negative, so it's not greater than 11 days. So we can skip this one.

3. **Respondent33**:
   - Admission: 2022-06-24
   - Discharge: 2022-07-25
   - Days: June has 30 days, so 30 -24 = 6 days in June. Then July 25. Total 6 +25 = 31 days. Over 11.
   - Medical Condition: ""d"" which maps to Diabetes. Not Asthma. So this one qualifies.

4. **Respondent126**:
   - Admission: 2021-01-03
   - Discharge: 2020-12-08. Again, discharge is before admission. 2020 is before 2021. So negative days. Invalid, so length is not over 11. Exclude.

5. **Respondent27**:
   - Admission: 2021-11-21
   - Discharge: 2021-11-22. That's 1 day. Not over 11. Exclude.

So the only respondent that meets both conditions is Respondent33. Let me double-check the medical condition. The pred:Medical_Condition is ""d"", which according to the schema is Diabetes. Correct, not Asthma. And the stay is 31 days. So the answer should be Respondent33.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondents have a calculated length of stay greater than 7 days and do not have a medical condition of 'Arthritis'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find which respondents have a length of stay greater than 7 days and do not have a medical condition of 'Arthritis'. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The responses include various predicates like pred:Date_of_Admission and pred:Discharge_Date, which are open-ended dates. The medical condition is an MCQ where 'a' corresponds to Arthritis.

So, for each respondent, I need to calculate the length of stay by finding the difference between Discharge Date and Admission Date. Then, check if that difference is more than 7 days. Also, ensure their Medical_Condition is not 'Arthritis' (which is option 'a' in the schema).

Looking at the respondents one by one:

1. **Respondent147**:
   - Admission: 2021-05-06
   - Discharge: 2021-06-06
   - Days between: From May 6 to June 6 is 31 days (since May has 31 days, 31 - 6 + 1 = 26 days in May, plus 6 days in June? Wait, no. Wait, May 6 to June 6 is 31 days total? Let me check. May 6 to May 31 is 25 days (including the 6th), then June 1 to June 6 is 6 days. Total 25 +6 =31 days. So 31 days. That's definitely more than 7.
   - Medical Condition: 'a' which maps to Arthritis. But the task is to exclude those with Arthritis. So this respondent is excluded.

2. **Respondent73**:
   - Admission: 2024-01-05
   - Discharge: 2024-03-26
   - Let's calculate the days. January has 31 days. From Jan 5 to Jan 31: 31 -5 +1 =27 days. February 2024 is a leap year, so 29 days. March 1 to March 26: 26 days. Total: 27 +29 +26 =82 days. That's way over 7.
   - Medical Condition: 'd' which maps to Diabetes. So not Arthritis. This respondent meets both criteria.

3. **Respondent121**:
   - Admission: 2021-10-27
   - Discharge: 2021-11-21
   - October 27 to October 31: 5 days (27,28,29,30,31). November 1 to 21: 21 days. Total 5+21=26 days. More than 7.
   - Medical Condition: 'e' which is Hypertension. Not Arthritis. So included.

4. **Respondent123**:
   - Admission: 2019-10-13
   - Discharge: 2019-12-21
   - October 13-31: 19 days (31-13+1=19). November: 30 days. December 1-21:21 days. Total 19+30+21=70 days. Over 7.
   - Medical Condition: 'c' which is Cancer. Not Arthritis. Included.

5. **Respondent113**:
   - Admission: 2021-05-14
   - Discharge: 2021-03-20. Wait, wait, the discharge date is March 20, which is before the admission date in May. That can't be right. Maybe a typo? Let me check again. The admission is 2021-05-14, discharge is 2021-03-20. That's impossible; discharge date is before admission. This must be an error in the data. So the length of stay would be negative, which doesn't make sense. So this respondent's data is invalid. Therefore, they don't meet the criteria. 

So the valid respondents are 73, 121, 123. Their medical conditions are Diabetes, Hypertension, Cancer respectively, none are Arthritis, and their stays are over 7 days. 

Now, compiling the list of their IDs: Respondent73, Respondent121, Respondent123.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents who are treated by the same doctor as the patient in room '272' and were admitted for the same admission type.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The question is asking to list all respondents who are treated by the same doctor as the patient in room '272' and were admitted for the same admission type. 

First, I need to find out which respondent is in room 272. Looking through the responses, I check each entry's Room_Number. Scanning the data:

- Respondent48 has Room_Number ""263""
- Respondent14: ""255""
- Respondent65: ""211""
- Respondent123: ""328""
- Respondent30: ""272"" ← Found it.
- Respondent17: ""182""
- Respondent103: ""138""
- Respondent126: ""321""
- Respondent19: ""333""
- Respondent148: ""177""

So, Respondent30 is in room 272. Now, I need to note their Doctor and Admission_Type. 

Respondent30's Doctor is ""DOC_30"" and Admission_Type is ""b"". 

Next, the task is to find all other respondents who have Doctor ""DOC_30"" and Admission_Type ""b"". 

Looking through each respondent again:

- Respondent48: Doctor ""DOC_48"", Admission_Type ""a"" → No
- Respondent14: ""DOC_14"", ""a"" → No
- Respondent65: ""DOC_65"", ""a"" → No
- Respondent123: ""DOC_123"", ""c"" → No
- Respondent30: Already the source, so maybe include? The question says ""all respondents"", but need to check if it's including the original or not. The task says ""treated by the same doctor as the patient in room 272"", so if the original is included, but let's see. But first, check others.
- Respondent17: ""DOC_17"", ""a"" → No
- Respondent103: ""DOC_103"", ""b"" → Doctor different
- Respondent126: ""DOC_126"", ""b"" → Doctor different
- Respondent19: ""DOC_19"", ""b"" → Doctor different
- Respondent148: ""DOC_148"", ""c"" → No

So, only Respondent30 has Doctor ""DOC_30"" and Admission_Type ""b"". Wait, but the task says ""the same doctor as the patient in room 272"" (which is DOC_30) and same admission type (b). Are there any other respondents with DOC_30 and admission type b? From the data provided, I don't see any other respondents with Doctor ""DOC_30"". So the only one is Respondent30. 

But the question says ""list all respondents"", which might include the original patient (Respondent30) or not. The way the question is phrased, it's asking for others treated by the same doctor and same admission type as the patient in room 272. If the original is included, then Respondent30 is the only one. If not, then there are none. But since the task doesn't specify excluding the original, I think it's safe to include them. 

Therefore, the answer should be Respondent30. But wait, the output format says for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list. The respondents are identified by their IDs like :Respondent30. So the answer would be ""30"".

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondents have a calculated length of stay greater than 14 days and do not have a medical condition of 'Asthma'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find which respondents have a length of stay greater than 14 days and do not have a medical condition of 'Asthma'. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The responses include various predicates like pred:Date_of_Admission and pred:Discharge_Date, which are open-ended dates. The medical condition is an MCQ, so I need to map the response codes to their corresponding values.

For each respondent, I'll calculate the length of stay by finding the difference between the discharge date and admission date. Then, check if that difference is more than 14 days. Also, check if their medical condition isn't 'Asthma' (which is option B in the schema).

Looking at the respondents one by one:

1. **Respondent143**:
   - Admission: 2022-12-10
   - Discharge: 2022-09-27. Wait, discharge is before admission? That's a problem. Maybe a typo. If the dates are swapped, the stay would be negative, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps this is an error, but as per the data, the length is negative. So we can't count this.

2. **Respondent107**:
   - Admission: 2024-01-31
   - Discharge: 2024-02-02
   - Days: 2 days (from Jan 31 to Feb 2 is 2 days). Not greater than 14. So exclude.

3. **Respondent58**:
   - Admission: 2020-05-22
   - Discharge: 2020-06-08
   - Calculate days: From May 22 to June 8. May has 31 days, so 31 - 22 = 9 days in May, plus 8 in June = 17 days. So 17 days. That's over 14.
   - Medical condition: ""d"" maps to Diabetes (from schema: D. Diabetes). So not Asthma. So this respondent qualifies.

4. **Respondent134**:
   - Admission: 2021-12-01
   - Discharge: 2022-01-15
   - December has 31 days. From Dec 1 to Dec 31: 30 days. Then January 1 to 15: 15 days. Total 45 days. Over 14.
   - Medical condition: ""f"" which is Obesity. So not Asthma. Qualifies.

5. **Respondent98**:
   - Admission: 2021-04-17
   - Discharge: 2021-03-11. Again, discharge before admission. Negative days. Data error. Exclude.

6. **Respondent116**:
   - Admission: 2020-06-23
   - Discharge: 2020-06-22. Again, discharge before admission. Negative. Exclude.

So the qualifying respondents are 58 and 134. Their medical conditions are Diabetes and Obesity, respectively, neither of which is Asthma. Their stays are 17 and 45 days, both over 14.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondents have a calculated length of stay greater than 18 days and do not have a medical condition of 'Diabetes'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find which respondents have a length of stay greater than 18 days and do not have a medical condition of 'Diabetes'. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The responses include various fields like Date_of_Admission and Discharge_Date, which are open-ended dates. The Medical_Condition is an MCQ field where the options are Arthritis, Asthma, Cancer, Diabetes, Hypertension, Obesity. The answer requires calculating the length of stay (LOS) by finding the difference between Discharge_Date and Date_of_Admission for each respondent. Then, check if LOS > 18 days and if their Medical_Condition is not Diabetes.

Let me start by listing all respondents and their relevant data. For each respondent, I'll need to:

1. Parse the Date_of_Admission and Discharge_Date into date objects.
2. Calculate the difference in days between these two dates.
3. Check if the difference is greater than 18.
4. Check if their Medical_Condition (after mapping from the MCQ code) is not 'Diabetes'.

Looking at the data:

- **Respondent77**: 
  - Admission: 2024-04-05
  - Discharge: 2024-02-10. Wait, that's a problem. The discharge date is before the admission date. That can't be right. Maybe a typo? Let me check again. The admission is April 5, 2024, discharge February 10, 2024. That's impossible. Maybe the dates are swapped? Or maybe it's a mistake in the data. Since the discharge is before admission, the LOS would be negative. So this might be an error, but according to the data, LOS is negative, so it's not greater than 18. So we can skip this one.

- **Respondent110**:
  - Admission: 2019-12-12
  - Discharge: 2019-08-21. Again, discharge is before admission. Another data inconsistency. Negative LOS. So no.

- **Respondent79**:
  - Admission: 2021-01-07
  - Discharge: 2020-12-18. Again, discharge before admission. Negative LOS. So no.

- **Respondent146**:
  - Admission: 2021-03-04
  - Discharge: 2021-02-06. Discharge before admission. Negative. No.

- **Respondent16**:
  - Admission: 2020-01-24
  - Discharge: 2019-12-13. Again, discharge before admission. Negative. No.

- **Respondent26**:
  - Admission: 2020-05-04
  - Discharge: 2020-07-14. Here, discharge is after admission. Let's calculate LOS. May 4 to July 14. May has 31 days, so from May 4 to May 31: 27 days. June has 30 days. July 1 to 14: 14 days. Total: 27 + 30 +14 = 71 days. That's 71 days, which is greater than 18. Now check Medical_Condition. The code is ""d"" for Medical_Condition. The options are A. Arthritis B. Asthma C. Cancer D. Diabetes E. Hypertension F. Obesity. So ""d"" maps to Diabetes. But the task is to exclude Diabetes. So this respondent is excluded.

- **Respondent54**:
  - Admission: 2023-12-23
  - Discharge: 2024-02-07. Let's calculate. From Dec 23 to Dec 31: 8 days. January has 31 days. February 1-7: 7 days. Total: 8 +31 +7=46 days. LOS is 46. Medical_Condition is ""d"" (Diabetes). So excluded.

- **Respondent55**:
  - Admission: 2024-03-17
  - Discharge: 2024-04-22. March 17 to March 31: 14 days. April 1-22: 22 days. Total 36 days. LOS 36. Medical_Condition is ""e"" which maps to Hypertension. So this one meets the criteria (LOS >18 and not Diabetes). So include Respondent55.

- **Respondent68**:
  - Admission: 2022-08-22
  - Discharge: 2022-09-18. August 22-31: 9 days. September 1-18: 18 days. Total 27 days. LOS 27. Medical_Condition is ""c"" (Cancer). So include Respondent68.

- **Respondent21**:
  - Admission: 2021-11-13
  - Discharge: 2021-08-19. Discharge before admission. Negative. Exclude.

- **Respondent41**:
  - Admission: 2021-09-10
  - Discharge: 2021-09-18. That's 8 days. LOS 8. Not >18. Exclude.

- **Respondent62**:
  - Admission: 2024-02-22
  - Discharge: 2024-02-04. Discharge before admission. Negative. Exclude.

So from all respondents, only Respondent55 and Respondent68 meet the criteria. Let me double-check:

**Respondent55**:
- LOS: 36 days (correct)
- Medical_Condition: ""e"" → Hypertension (not Diabetes). Correct.

**Respondent68**:
- LOS: 27 days (correct)
- Medical_Condition: ""c"" → Cancer (not Diabetes). Correct.

No others. So the answer should be these two respondents.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents who are treated by the same doctor as the patient in room '245' and were admitted for the same admission type.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The question is asking to list all respondents who are treated by the same doctor as the patient in room '245' and were admitted for the same admission type. 

First, I need to find out which patient is in room 245. Looking at the responses, I'll check each respondent's Room_Number. 

Checking Respondent43: Room_Number is 468. Not 245.
Respondent79: Room_Number 300. Nope.
Respondent146: Room_Number 245. Here we go. So the patient in room 245 is Respondent146.

Now, I need to find out their doctor and admission type. For Respondent146, pred:Doctor is ""DOC_146"" and pred:Admission_Type is ""b"". 

Next, I need to find all other respondents who have the same doctor (DOC_146) and the same admission type (b). Let's check each respondent:

Respondent43: Doctor is DOC_43, Admission_Type a. Doesn't match.
Respondent79: Doctor DOC_79, Admission_Type c. No match.
Respondent74: Doctor DOC_74, Admission_Type b. Doctor doesn't match.
Respondent113: Doctor DOC_113, Admission_Type a. No.

Wait, but Respondent146 is the only one with DOC_146. So there are no other respondents with the same doctor and admission type. Therefore, the only respondent is Respondent146 themselves. But the task says ""list all respondents"", which might include the original patient if they meet the criteria. However, sometimes such questions want others, but the wording here doesn't exclude the original. 

But according to the data, only Respondent146 has DOC_146 and admission type b. So the answer should be just Respondent146. But let me double-check. Are there any other respondents with Admission_Type ""b""? Let's see:

Respondent74 has Admission_Type ""b"", but their doctor is DOC_74. Respondent146's admission type is ""b"", and doctor DOC_146. So no others. Therefore, the only respondent is Respondent146.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents who are treated by the same doctor as the patient in room '300' and were admitted for the same admission type.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The question is asking to list all respondents who are treated by the same doctor as the patient in room '300' and were admitted for the same admission type. 

First, I need to find out which patient is in room '300'. Looking at the responses, I'll check each respondent's Room_Number. Scanning through the data:

- Respondent120 has Room_Number ""361""
- Respondent78 has ""310""
- Respondent104 has ""300""
- Respondent70 has ""424""
- Respondent129 has ""318""
- Respondent139 has ""330""

So, Respondent104 is the one in room 300. Now, I need to find out their doctor and admission type. 

For Respondent104:
- Doctor is ""DOC_104""
- Admission_Type is ""a""

Next, I need to find all other respondents who have the same doctor (DOC_104) and the same admission type (a). Let's check each respondent:

- Respondent120: Doctor is DOC_120, Admission_Type ""c"" → Doesn't match.
- Respondent78: Doctor DOC_78, Admission_Type ""c"" → No.
- Respondent104: Already the reference, so skip.
- Respondent70: Doctor DOC_70, Admission_Type ""a"" → Doctor doesn't match.
- Respondent129: Doctor DOC_129, Admission_Type ""a"" → Doctor doesn't match.
- Respondent139: Doctor DOC_139, Admission_Type ""c"" → No.

Wait, none of the other respondents have Doctor DOC_104. So the only one is Respondent104 themselves. But the task says ""all respondents"" including the patient in room 300? The question is a bit ambiguous. Let me re-read the task.

""List all respondents who are treated by the same doctor as the patient in room '300' and were admitted for the same admission type.""

So, the patient in room 300 (Respondent104) has doctor DOC_104 and admission type ""a"". We need to find others with DOC_104 and ""a"". But looking at the data, no other respondents have DOC_104. Therefore, only Respondent104 meets both criteria. However, the task might be asking for other respondents besides the original patient. But the way it's phrased, it's possible that the patient themselves is included. 

But according to the data, there's no other respondent with DOC_104. So the answer would just be Respondent104. But the output format requires a list of respondent IDs. The respondents are named like :Respondent104, so their ID is 104. 

Wait, the output instructions say for a list of names or IDs, provide a comma-separated list. So the answer should be ""104"" if only that one, or others if any. But according to the data, no others match. So the answer is 104.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents who are treated by the same doctor as the patient in room '268' and were admitted for the same admission type.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to list all respondents who are treated by the same doctor as the patient in room '268' and were admitted for the same admission type. 

First, I need to find out which patient is in room 268. Looking through the responses, I check each respondent's Room_Number. Scanning the data, I see that Respondent113 has pred:Room_Number ""268"". So, the patient in room 268 is Respondent113.

Next, I need to determine the doctor assigned to Respondent113. Checking their details, the Doctor is ""DOC_113"". So, the target doctor is DOC_113.

Now, I need to find all other respondents who have pred:Doctor ""DOC_113"". Let me go through each respondent:

- Respondent21: Doctor is DOC_21 → No
- Respondent11: DOC_11 → No
- Respondent111: DOC_111 → No
- Respondent83: DOC_83 → No
- Respondent65: DOC_65 → No
- Respondent7: DOC_07 → No
- Respondent24: DOC_24 → No
- Respondent59: DOC_59 → No
- Respondent148: DOC_148 → No
- Respondent6: DOC_06 → No
- Respondent69: DOC_69 → No
- Respondent113: Already the source, so maybe include? The task says ""all respondents"" so maybe including the original? Wait, the question says ""treated by the same doctor as the patient in room 268"". So the patient in room 268 is part of the group. But looking at the data, only Respondent113 has DOC_113. So only Respondent113 is under DOC_113. Wait, but maybe I missed someone. Let me check again. All other respondents have different doctors. So the only one with DOC_113 is Respondent113.

But wait, the task also requires that they were admitted for the same admission type. So first, what's the admission type of Respondent113? Their Admission_Type is ""a"". According to the schema, QAdmission_Type has options A. Elective, B. Emergency, C. Urgent. So ""a"" maps to Elective.

Now, I need to find all respondents where pred:Admission_Type is ""a"" (Elective) and pred:Doctor is DOC_113. But from the data, only Respondent113 has DOC_113. So even if others have Admission_Type ""a"", they don't have the same doctor. Therefore, the only respondent that meets both conditions is Respondent113.

Wait, but the task says ""the same doctor as the patient in room 268 and the same admission type"". So the doctor is DOC_113, and admission type is Elective. So any respondent with Doctor DOC_113 and Admission_Type ""a"" (Elective). Since only Respondent113 fits both, the answer would be just Respondent113. But maybe the question is to include others who share the same doctor and same admission type as the room 268 patient. But since no one else has DOC_113, the list is only Respondent113.

But let me double-check. Are there any other respondents with Admission_Type ""a""? Let's see:

- Respondent113: a (Elective)
- Respondent65: a (Elective)
- Respondent6: a (Elective)
- Respondent24: b (Emergency)
- Respondent7: b
- Respondent21: b
- Respondent11: b
- Respondent111: b
- Respondent83: c (Urgent)
- Respondent59: c
- Respondent148: c
- Respondent69: b

So Respondent65 and Respondent6 also have Admission_Type ""a"". But their doctors are DOC_65 and DOC_06, respectively. So they don't share the same doctor as the room 268 patient. Therefore, the only respondent that meets both conditions is Respondent113.

But wait, the task says ""treated by the same doctor as the patient in room 268 and were admitted for the same admission type"". So the doctor is DOC_113, and admission type is Elective. So only Respondent113. Therefore, the answer is Respondent113.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondents have a calculated length of stay greater than 6 days and do not have a medical condition of 'Cancer'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find which respondents have a length of stay greater than 6 days and do not have a medical condition of 'Cancer'. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The responses include various predicates like pred:Date_of_Admission and pred:Discharge_Date, which are open-ended dates. The medical condition is an MCQ with options including Cancer (option C). 

For each respondent, I need to calculate the length of stay by finding the difference between Discharge Date and Admission Date. Then, check if that difference is more than 6 days. Also, ensure their medical condition isn't 'Cancer'. 

Looking at the respondents:

1. **Respondent45**: 
   - Admission: 2022-10-12
   - Discharge: 2022-09-25
   Wait, discharge is before admission? That can't be right. Maybe a typo? Let me check the dates again. If admission is October 12 and discharge September 25, that's negative days. That doesn't make sense. Maybe the dates are swapped? Or perhaps a data entry error. Since the discharge is earlier, the length of stay would be negative, which isn't possible. So maybe this respondent's data is incorrect, and we can't calculate a valid length of stay. So we'll exclude them.

2. **Respondent121**:
   - Admission: 2021-10-27
   - Discharge: 2021-11-21
   Let's calculate the days. From October 27 to November 21. October has 31 days, so 31 - 27 = 4 days in October, plus 21 in November. Total 25 days. 25 > 6. Medical condition is 'e', which maps to 'Hypertension' (from QMedical_Condition options). So this meets both conditions.

3. **Respondent133**:
   - Admission: 2023-10-15
   - Discharge: 2024-01-02
   Let's compute the days. From October 15 to January 2. October has 17 days left (31-15+1=17?), November 30, December 31, January 2. Total: 17 + 30 +31 +2 = 80 days? Wait, maybe I should use exact date difference. Let me check: October 15 to November 15 is 31 days (since October has 31), November 15 to December 15 is 30, December 15 to January 2 is 18 days. Total 31+30+18=79 days. Either way, way over 6. Medical condition is 'c' which is 'Cancer'. So this respondent has Cancer, so they should be excluded.

4. **Respondent114**:
   - Admission: 2024-01-04
   - Discharge: 2023-11-08
   Again, discharge is before admission. That's impossible. Another data error. So invalid, exclude.

5. **Respondent72**:
   - Admission: 2020-05-15
   - Discharge: 2020-06-14
   Calculate days: From May 15 to June 14. May has 31 days, so 31 -15 = 16 days in May, plus 14 in June: 16 +14 = 30 days. 30 >6. Medical condition is 'e' which is 'Hypertension'. So this meets both conditions.

So the valid respondents are 121 and 72. But wait, let me double-check the medical conditions. 

Looking at QMedical_Condition: options are A. Arthritis, B. Asthma, C. Cancer, D. Diabetes, E. Hypertension, F. Obesity. 

Respondent121's Medical_Condition is 'e' → Hypertension. Correct. 

Respondent72's Medical_Condition is 'e' → Hypertension. Correct. 

Respondent133's is 'c' → Cancer, so excluded. 

The others have invalid dates (45 and 114) or are excluded due to medical condition (133). 

So the answer should be Respondent121 and Respondent72.

Respondent121, Respondent72",False
