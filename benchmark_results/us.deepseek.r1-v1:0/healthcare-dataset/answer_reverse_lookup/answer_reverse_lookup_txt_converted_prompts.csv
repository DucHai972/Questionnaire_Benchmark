</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents with gender = 'Female' and admission type = 'Emergency'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task. The user wants a list of all respondents who are female and had an emergency admission type. Let me start by understanding the data structure.

First, looking at the questions section, gender is an MCQ with options A. Female and B. Male. So, in the responses, 'a' would be Female. The admission type is another MCQ: A. Elective, B. Emergency, C. Urgent. So, 'b' in the response corresponds to Emergency.

Now, I need to go through each respondent in the data and check these two conditions. Let's list out all the respondents one by one.

Starting with Respondent 63: Gender is 'b' (Male), so skip.

Respondent 38: Gender 'b' (Male), skip.

Respondent 2: Gender 'b' (Male), skip.

Respondent 28: Gender 'b', skip.

Respondent 109: Gender 'b', skip.

Respondent 57: Gender 'a' (Female). Admission type is 'a' (Elective). Doesn't meet the Emergency condition. So skip.

Respondent 46: Gender 'a' (Female). Admission type is 'c' (Urgent). Not Emergency. Skip.

Respondent 133: Gender 'b', skip.

Respondent 119: Gender 'a' (Female). Admission type is 'a' (Elective). No match.

Respondent 13: Gender 'b', skip.

Respondent 143: Gender 'b', skip.

Wait, did I miss anyone? Let me check again. The respondents are 63, 38, 2, 28, 109, 57, 46, 133, 119, 13, 143. 

Looking at each female (gender 'a'):

- Respondent 57: Admission type 'a' (Elective)
- Respondent 46: Admission type 'c' (Urgent)
- Respondent 119: Admission type 'a' (Elective)

None of the female respondents have admission type 'b' (Emergency). So there are no respondents that meet both criteria. The answer should be None.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose billing amount is between 13115 and 39267.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task. I need to find all respondents whose billing amount is between 13,115 and 39,267. 

First, I'll look at the data provided. Each respondent has a ""Billing Amount"" field, which is an open-ended question, so the values are numbers. The task is to check which of these numbers fall within the specified range.

Let me go through each respondent one by one:

- **Respondent 32**: Billing Amount is 39723. That's above 39,267, so no.
- **Respondent 117**: 20,228. This is between 13,115 and 39,267. Yes.
- **Respondent 35**: 10,284. Below 13,115. No.
- **Respondent 119**: 6,768. Also below. No.
- **Respondent 136**: 4,398. Still below. No.
- **Respondent 144**: 16,320. Within the range. Yes.
- **Respondent 82**: 47,985. Way above. No.
- **Respondent 114**: 20,258. Also within the range. Yes.

So the respondents with billing amounts in the specified range are 117, 144, and 114. Let me double-check the numbers to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 

117: 20,228 is between 13,115 and 39,267. Correct.
144: 16,320 is also in between. Correct.
114: 20,258 is within the range. Correct.

No others meet the criteria. So the answer should be these three respondents.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose billing amount is between 27216 and 43551.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task. I need to find all respondents whose billing amount is between 27,216 and 43,551. 

First, I'll look at the data provided. Each respondent has a ""Billing Amount"" entry. Since this is an open-ended question, the values are numerical. The task is to check which of these amounts fall within the specified range.

Let me go through each respondent one by one:

- Respondent 141: Billing Amount 46378. That's above 43,551, so no.
- Respondent 115: 40693. This is within the range because 27,216 ≤ 40,693 ≤ 43,551. So yes.
- Respondent 41: 32974. Also within the range. Yes.
- Respondent 122: 48996. Above the upper limit. No.
- Respondent 116: 40015. Within range. Yes.
- Respondent 67: 42685. Within range. Yes.
- Respondent 64: 45354. Above 43,551. No.
- Respondent 71: 31486. Within range. Yes.
- Respondent 134: 37910. Within range. Yes.
- Respondent 125: 21772. Below 27,216. No.
- Respondent 62: 44437. Above 43,551. No.

Now, compiling the respondent IDs that meet the criteria: 115, 41, 116, 67, 71, 134. Let me double-check each amount to be sure. 

115: 40,693 – yes. 41: 32,974 – yes. 116: 40,015 – yes. 67: 42,685 – yes. 71: 31,486 – yes. 134: 37,910 – yes. The others are either below or above. So the answer should be these six respondents.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondents have a medication of 'Aspirin'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task. The question is asking which respondents have a medication of 'Aspirin'. First, I need to look at the data provided and understand how the medication field is structured.

Looking at the questions section, question 13 is about Medication, which is a multiple-choice question (MCQ) with options A. Aspirin, B. Ibuprofen, C. Lipitor, D. Paracetamol, E. Penicillin. So, the responses for medication will be one of these letters (a to e), and I need to map them to the corresponding medication names.

Now, I need to go through each respondent's data and check their Medication entry. The output should be the list of respondent IDs where the medication code corresponds to 'Aspirin', which is option A.

Starting with Respondent 113: Medication is 'a' → Aspirin. So, include 113.

Respondent 20: Medication is 'a' → Aspirin. Include 20.

Respondent 74: Medication is 'a' → Aspirin. Include 74.

Respondent 61: Medication is 'e' → Penicillin. Exclude.

Respondent 70: Medication is 'e' → Penicillin. Exclude.

Respondent 86: Medication is 'b' → Ibuprofen. Exclude.

Respondent 82: Medication is 'a' → Aspirin. Include 82.

Respondent 139: Medication is 'a' → Aspirin. Include 139.

Respondent 21: Medication is 'e' → Penicillin. Exclude.

So the respondents with Aspirin are 113, 20, 74, 82, 139. Let me double-check each one to make sure I didn't miss any. Yep, that's correct. All these have 'a' in their Medication field, which maps to Aspirin.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondents have a doctor of 'DOC_107'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task. The question is asking which respondents have a doctor of 'DOC_107'. 

First, I need to look through each respondent's data in the provided responses. The Doctor field is an open-ended question, so the responses should be exact strings.

Starting with Respondent 39: Their Doctor is DOC_39. Not a match.

Respondent 60: Doctor is DOC_60. Still not the one.

Respondent 99: Doctor DOC_99. Nope.

Respondent 40: DOC_40. Not it.

Respondent 55: DOC_55. No.

Respondent 17: DOC_17. Not matching.

Then Respondent 107: Here, the Doctor is DOC_107. That's the one we're looking for. 

Wait, are there any other respondents? Let me check again. The list includes up to Respondent 107. No others beyond that. So only Respondent 107 has the doctor DOC_107. 

The answer should be just the respondent number, which is 107.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose billing amount is between 12541 and 40186.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task. I need to find all respondents whose billing amount is between 12,541 and 40,186. 

First, I'll go through each respondent's data and check their billing amount. The billing amount is an open-ended field, so the values are numerical. I need to convert those to integers to compare them.

Starting with Respondent 85: Billing is 44,940. That's above 40,186, so no. 

Respondent 139: 18,843. That's within the range. 

Respondent 120: 49,402. Over the upper limit. 

Respondent 107: 3,326. Too low. 

Respondent 16: 36,992. That's between 12,541 and 40,186. 

Respondent 53: 48,291. Over. 

Respondent 108: 22,951. Within range. 

Respondent 100: 8,000. Below. 

Respondent 150: 13,356. That's in. 

Respondent 6: 25,835. Also within. 

Respondent 148: 28,838. Yes, that's between the two numbers. 

So compiling the list: 139, 16, 108, 150, 6, 148. Let me double-check each:

139: 18,843 ✅  
16: 36,992 ✅  
108: 22,951 ✅  
150: 13,356 ✅  
6: 25,835 ✅  
148: 28,838 ✅  

All these are between 12,541 and 40,186. The others are either below or above. So the answer should be the respondent numbers separated by commas.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose room number is between 180 and 363.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task. I need to find all respondents whose room number is between 180 and 363. Let me start by understanding the data structure.

First, looking at the questions, the Room Number is an open-ended field (Question 10). So the responses will be numerical values. The task is to check each respondent's room number and see if it falls within the range 180 to 363, inclusive.

Now, I'll go through each respondent one by one and check their room number.

Starting with Respondent 123: Room Number is 328. 328 is between 180 and 363, so that's a yes.

Respondent 2: Room 134. 134 is below 180, so no.

Respondent 91: Room 406. 406 is above 363, so no.

Respondent 77: Room 233. 233 is within the range. Include this one.

Respondent 100: Room 273. That's within the range. Include.

Respondent 108: Room 119. Below 180. Exclude.

Respondent 138: Room 133. Also below. Exclude.

Respondent 140: Room 260. That's between 180 and 363. Include.

Respondent 57: Room 378. Above 363. Exclude.

Respondent 125: Room 244. Within range. Include.

Respondent 70: Room 424. Above 363. Exclude.

So compiling the list: Respondents 123, 77, 100, 140, 125. Let me double-check each room number again to be sure.

123: 328 ✅
77: 233 ✅
100: 273 ✅
140: 260 ✅
125: 244 ✅

Yes, those are all between 180 and 363. No others meet the criteria. The answer should be their respondent numbers separated by commas.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondents have a blood type of 'AB-'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task. The question is asking which respondents have a blood type of 'AB-'. First, I need to refer to the data provided.

Looking at the questions section, question 3 is about blood type. The options are A. A+, B. A-, C. AB+, D. AB-, E. B+, F. B-, G. O+, H. O-. So the code for AB- is 'D'. 

Now, I need to check each respondent's Blood Type entry in the responses. Let's go through each one:

- Respondent 125: Blood Type is 'a' → A+, not AB-.
- Respondent 8: Blood Type 'e' → B+.
- Respondent 100: Blood Type 'b' → A-.
- Respondent 87: Blood Type 'a' → A+.
- Respondent 104: Blood Type 'b' → A-.
- Respondent 43: Blood Type 'd' → AB- (this matches).
- Respondent 120: Blood Type 'f' → B-.
- Respondent 33: Blood Type 'e' → B+.
- Respondent 137: Blood Type 'h' → O-.
- Respondent 7: Blood Type 'f' → B-.
- Respondent 101: Blood Type 'f' → B-.

Only Respondent 43 has Blood Type 'd', which corresponds to AB-. So the answer should be Respondent 43.

<task>
List all respondents with admission type = 'Urgent' and medication = 'Paracetamol'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The goal is to list all respondents who have an admission type of 'Urgent' and are taking the medication 'Paracetamol'. 

First, I need to refer back to the questions section to understand the MCQ options. For admission type (question 11), the options are A. Elective, B. Emergency, C. Urgent. So, the code 'c' corresponds to Urgent. For medication (question 13), the options are A. Aspirin, B. Ibuprofen, C. Lipitor, D. Paracetamol, E. Penicillin. So, code 'd' is Paracetamol.

Now, I'll go through each respondent in the responses and check these two fields. Let's start with Respondent 22. Their admission type is 'c' (Urgent) and medication is 'c' (Lipitor). So, medication doesn't match Paracetamol. Next, Respondent 110: admission type 'a' (Elective), so no. Respondent 35 has admission type 'b' (Emergency), which isn't Urgent. Respondent 119's admission type is 'a' (Elective), so no. Respondent 47's admission type is 'c' (Urgent), and medication is 'b' (Ibuprofen). So, only admission type matches here, but medication doesn't. 

Wait, none of the respondents have both admission type 'c' and medication 'd'. Let me double-check. Respondent 22: admission type c (Urgent), medication c (Lipitor). Respondent 47: admission type c (Urgent), medication b (Ibuprofen). Others have different admission types. So, there are no respondents that meet both criteria. The answer should be None.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondents have a blood type of 'AB-'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task. The question is asking which respondents have a blood type of 'AB-'. 

First, I need to check the data provided. The Blood Type question in the schema is a multiple-choice question with options A. A+, B. A-, C. AB+, D. AB-, E. B+, F. B-, G. O+, H. O-. So the possible codes are a to h, corresponding to these options.

Looking at each respondent's Blood Type entry:

- Respondent 67: Blood Type is 'a'. According to the schema, 'a' is A+. So that's not AB-.
- Respondent 98: Blood Type 'e' which is E. B+.
- Respondent 84: Blood Type 'd' which maps to D. AB-.
- Respondent 55: Blood Type 'd' again, so AB-.
- Respondent 117: Blood Type 'd' as well, so AB-.

So respondents 84, 55, and 117 have Blood Type 'd', which translates to AB-. 

Wait, let me double-check. The options for Blood Type are A. A+, B. A-, C. AB+, D. AB-, etc. So 'd' is definitely AB-. 

So the answer should be the respondents with Blood Type 'd', which are 84, 55, and 117. Let me confirm each one:

Respondent 84: Blood Type d → AB-
Respondent 55: Blood Type d → AB-
Respondent 117: Blood Type d → AB-

Yes, those three. The other respondents have different codes. So the answer is the list of these three respondents.

<task>
List all respondents with gender = 'Female' and test results = 'Abnormal'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task. I need to list all respondents who have a gender of 'Female' and test results of 'Abnormal'. 

First, I'll check the questions section to understand the MCQ mappings. For gender, the options are A. Female and B. Male. So, if a respondent's gender is 'a', that's Female. For test results, the options are A. Abnormal, B. Inconclusive, C. Normal. So, test result 'a' maps to Abnormal.

Now, I'll go through each respondent in the responses. Let's look at each one:

Respondent 87: Gender is 'a' (Female), Test Results 'c' (Normal). Doesn't meet both conditions.

Respondent 98: Gender 'a' (Female), Test Results 'c' (Normal). No.

Respondent 72: Gender 'a' (Female), Test Results 'b' (Inconclusive). Not matching.

Respondent 108: Gender 'a' (Female), Test Results 'c' (Normal). Nope.

Respondent 65: Gender 'a' (Female), Test Results 'c' (Normal). Doesn't fit.

Respondent 21: Gender 'b' (Male), Test Results 'b' (Inconclusive). Not applicable.

Respondent 121: Gender 'a' (Female), Test Results 'c' (Normal). Still no.

Respondent 5: Gender 'a' (Female), Test Results 'a' (Abnormal). This one meets both conditions. So Respondent 5 is in the list.

Respondent 139: Gender is blank. So can't be Female. Excluded.

Respondent 14: Gender 'a' (Female), Test Results 'b' (Inconclusive). Doesn't match.

Only Respondent 5 fits both criteria. Let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anyone. Yep, that's the only one.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents with hospital = 'HOSP_33' and gender = 'Female'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The question is asking to list all respondents where the hospital is 'HOSP_33' and the gender is 'Female'. 

First, I need to recall the data schema. The gender field is an MCQ with options A. Female and B. Male. So, in the responses, if a respondent's gender is 'a', that's Female, and 'b' is Male.

Now, looking at the responses provided, I need to go through each respondent one by one and check two things: their hospital and their gender. 

Starting with Respondent 58: Hospital is HOSP_58, gender is 'b' (Male). Doesn't match.

Respondent 18: Hospital HOSP_18, gender 'b' (Male). No.

Respondent 11: HOSP_11, gender 'b' (Male). Not a match.

Respondent 8: HOSP_08, gender 'b' (Male). Nope.

Respondent 64: HOSP_64, gender 'a' (Female). Hospital doesn't match HOSP_33.

Respondent 52: HOSP_52, gender 'b' (Male). Not it.

Respondent 6: HOSP_06, gender 'b'. Still not.

Respondent 40: HOSP_40, gender 'a' (Female). Hospital not HOSP_33.

Respondent 62: HOSP_62, gender 'b' (Male). No.

Respondent 33: Hospital is HOSP_33. Let's check gender: gender is 'b' (Male). So even though the hospital matches, the gender is Male, so this doesn't fit the criteria.

Wait, did I miss any? Let me check again. All respondents listed here have hospitals that don't match HOSP_33 except Respondent 33, but their gender is Male. So there are no respondents that meet both conditions. Therefore, the answer should be None.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents with gender = 'Female' and blood type = 'A+'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The goal is to list all respondents who have a gender of 'Female' and a blood type of 'A+'. 

First, I need to refer to the questions section to understand how the responses are coded. 

Looking at the Gender question: it's an MCQ with options A. Female and B. Male. So, in the responses, 'a' corresponds to Female and 'b' to Male. 

Next, the Blood Type question has options A. A+, B. A-, C. AB+, D. AB-, E. B+, F. B-, G. O+, H. O-. So, the code 'a' for Blood Type would mean A+.

Now, I need to go through each respondent in the responses and check if both their Gender is 'a' (Female) and Blood Type is 'a' (A+).

Let's check each respondent one by one:

- Respondent 30: Gender is 'a' (Female), Blood Type is 'f' (B-). Doesn't match.
- Respondent 145: Gender 'b' (Male). Skip.
- Respondent 56: Gender 'b'. Skip.
- Respondent 120: Gender 'b'. Skip.
- Respondent 66: Gender 'b'. Skip.
- Respondent 95: Gender 'a' (Female), Blood Type 'b' (A-). Doesn't match.
- Respondent 43: Gender 'a' (Female), Blood Type 'd' (AB-). Doesn't match.
- Respondent 42: Gender 'a' (Female), Blood Type 'g' (O+). Doesn't match.
- Respondent 80: Gender 'b'. Skip.
- Respondent 28: Gender 'b'. Skip.
- Respondent 149: Gender 'b'. Skip.
- Respondent 7: Gender 'b'. Skip.

Only checking the female respondents, none of them have Blood Type 'a' (A+). So, there are no respondents that meet both criteria.

<task>
Find all respondents whose age is between 30 and 63.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task. I need to find all respondents whose age is between 30 and 63. Let me start by going through each respondent's data and checking their age.

First, I'll look at Respondent 148. The age is 20. That's below 30, so they don't qualify. Next is Respondent 97, age 50. That's within the range. Then Respondent 102 is 59, which is also between 30 and 63. Respondent 51 is 49, which is okay. Respondent 20 is 65, which is over 63, so no. Respondent 63 is 43, that's within the range. Respondent 27 is 74, too old. Respondent 78 is 38, which is good. Respondent 31 is 33, also within the range. 

Wait, let me double-check each one. 

Respondent 148: 20 → exclude.
Respondent 97: 50 → include.
Respondent 102: 59 → include.
Respondent 51: 49 → include.
Respondent 20: 65 → exclude.
Respondent 63: 43 → include.
Respondent 27: 74 → exclude.
Respondent 78: 38 → include.
Respondent 31: 33 → include.

So the respondents that meet the age criteria are 97, 102, 51, 63, 78, 31. Let me check if there are any others I missed. The list of respondents provided ends at 31. So those six are the ones. Now, I need to list their respondent numbers. Let me confirm each age again to be sure. 

Yes, 50, 59, 49, 43, 38, 33 are all between 30 and 63. The answer should be a comma-separated list of their numbers: 97, 102, 51, 63, 78, 31.

<task>
Which respondents have a admission type of 'Elective'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task. The question is asking which respondents have an admission type of 'Elective'. 

First, I need to look at the questions section to understand the Admission Type field. The Admission Type question is MCQ with options A. Elective, B. Emergency, C. Urgent. So, the code 'a' corresponds to Elective, 'b' to Emergency, and 'c' to Urgent.

Now, I'll go through each respondent's data and check their Admission Type. 

Starting with Respondent 89: Admission Type is 'b', which maps to Emergency. Not Elective, so skip.

Respondent 137: Admission Type is 'b' again. Also Emergency. Not the one we need.

Respondent 110: Admission Type is 'a'. That's Elective. So this respondent qualifies. Their ID is 110.

Respondent 95: Admission Type is 'a' as well. Another Elective. Their ID is 95.

Respondent 18: Admission Type is 'b', which is Emergency. So not included.

So the respondents with Elective admission type are 110 and 95. The answer should be their IDs in a comma-separated list.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondents have a hospital of 'HOSP_40'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task. The question is asking which respondents have a hospital of 'HOSP_40'. 

First, I need to go through each respondent in the provided data and check their 'Hospital' field. The data given includes several respondents, each with their own set of details.

Starting with Respondent 4: Their hospital is HOSP_04. Not a match. Next, Respondent 108 has HOSP_108. Still not. Respondent 126's hospital is HOSP_126. Moving on to Respondent 28: HOSP_28. Respondent 111: HOSP_111. Respondent 93: HOSP_93. Respondent 118: HOSP_118. Now, Respondent 40: Here, the hospital is listed as HOSP_40. That's a match. Then Respondent 112: HOSP_112. Respondent 46: HOSP_46. 

So, after checking all the respondents, only Respondent 40 has the hospital 'HOSP_40'. The answer should be their identifier, which is Respondent 40.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents with test results = 'Normal' and medical condition = 'Asthma'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The goal is to list all respondents who have test results marked as 'Normal' and a medical condition of 'Asthma'. 

First, I need to refer back to the questions section to understand the mapping for the MCQ options. 

Looking at the Medical Condition question (Question 4), the options are:
A. Arthritis 
B. Asthma 
C. Cancer 
D. Diabetes 
E. Hypertension 
F. Obesity 

So, if a respondent's Medical Condition is 'b', that corresponds to Asthma.

For Test Results (Question 14), the options are:
A. Abnormal 
B. Inconclusive 
C. Normal 

Therefore, a test result of 'c' would map to Normal.

Now, I need to go through each respondent in the responses and check these two fields. Let's go through each one:

- **Respondent 138**: 
  - Medical Condition: a (Arthritis) → Doesn't match Asthma.
  - Test Results: a (Abnormal) → Not Normal. So, exclude.

- **Respondent 124**:
  - Medical Condition: a (Arthritis) → Exclude.

- **Respondent 120**:
  - Medical Condition: b (Asthma) → Good.
  - Test Results: b (Inconclusive) → Not Normal. Exclude.

- **Respondent 112**:
  - Medical Condition: c (Cancer) → Exclude.

- **Respondent 69**:
  - Medical Condition: f (Obesity) → Exclude.

- **Respondent 83**:
  - Medical Condition: a (Arthritis) → Exclude.

- **Respondent 63**:
  - Medical Condition: c (Cancer) → Exclude.

- **Respondent 23**:
  - Medical Condition: b (Asthma) → Check Test Results.
  - Test Results: c (Normal) → Both conditions met. Include this respondent.

- **Respondent 72**:
  - Medical Condition: e (Hypertension) → Exclude.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check Respondent 23. Their Test Results are listed as 'c', which maps to Normal. And Medical Condition is 'b' which is Asthma. So that's a match. 

Are there any others? Let me check again. 

Looking through all respondents again, only Respondent 23 has Medical Condition 'b' (Asthma) and Test Results 'c' (Normal). 

So the answer should be Respondent 23.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents with medication = 'Lipitor' and blood type = 'A-'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task. I need to list all respondents who have medication 'Lipitor' and blood type 'A-'. 

First, I'll check the questions section to understand the options for each MCQ. For medication, the options are A. Aspirin, B. Ibuprofen, C. Lipitor, D. Paracetamol, E. Penicillin. So, if a respondent's medication is 'c', that maps to Lipitor.

For blood type, the options are A. A+, B. A-, C. AB+, D. AB-, E. B+, F. B-, G. O+, H. O-. So, blood type 'B' would be A-.

Now, I'll go through each respondent in the responses and check these two fields. 

Starting with Respondent 63: Medication is 'b' (Ibuprofen), Blood Type 'd' (AB-). Doesn't match.

Respondent 119: Medication 'c' (Lipitor), Blood Type 'b' (A-). Oh, this one matches both conditions. So Respondent 119 is a candidate.

Respondent 146: Medication 'e' (Penicillin), Blood Type 'f' (B-). No.

Respondent 98: Medication 'b' (Ibuprofen), Blood Type 'e' (B+). No.

Respondent 87: Medication 'b' (Ibuprofen), Blood Type 'a' (A+). No.

Respondent 8: Medication 'b' (Ibuprofen), Blood Type 'e' (B+). No.

Respondent 127: Medication 'e' (Penicillin), Blood Type 'f' (B-). No.

Respondent 84: Medication 'b' (Ibuprofen), Blood Type 'd' (AB-). No.

Respondent 47: Medication 'b' (Ibuprofen), Blood Type 'e' (B+). No.

Respondent 125: Medication 'e' (Penicillin), Blood Type 'a' (A+). No.

Respondent 55: Medication 'd' (Paracetamol), Blood Type 'd' (AB-). No.

Respondent 91: Medication 'd' (Paracetamol), Blood Type 'b' (A-). Wait, blood type 'b' is A-, but medication is 'd' which is Paracetamol. So doesn't meet both.

Only Respondent 119 has medication 'c' (Lipitor) and blood type 'b' (A-). So the answer should be Respondent 119.

<task>
Find all respondents whose room number is between 180 and 376.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task. I need to find all respondents whose room number is between 180 and 376. Let me start by understanding the data structure.

First, looking at the questions, the Room Number is an open-ended field, so the responses are numerical values. The task is to check which respondents have a room number in the range 180 to 376, inclusive.

Now, I'll go through each respondent's data and check their room number. Let's list them out:

- Respondent 88: Room 442. That's above 376, so no.
- Respondent 72: Room 115. Below 180, so no.
- Respondent 71: Room 212. Between 180 and 376. Yes.
- Respondent 143: Room 130. Below 180. No.
- Respondent 3: Room 377. Wait, 377 is just above 376, so no.
- Respondent 133: Room 413. Above 376. No.
- Respondent 49: Room 130. Below 180. No.
- Respondent 22: Room 325. That's within the range. Yes.
- Respondent 62: Room 376. The upper limit is 376, so this is included. Yes.

So the respondents with room numbers between 180 and 376 are 71, 22, and 62. Let me double-check each number to be sure. 212, 325, 376 all fall within the range. The others are either below 180 or above 376. That seems correct.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondents have a test results of 'Abnormal'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task. The question is asking which respondents have a test result of 'Abnormal'. First, I need to look at the Test Results field in the questions section to understand the mapping. The Test Results question is an MCQ with options A. Abnormal, B. Inconclusive, C. Normal. So, if a respondent's Test Results value is 'a', that maps to Abnormal.

Now, I'll go through each respondent in the responses and check their Test Results value. Let's start with Respondent 126: Test Results is 'a' which is Abnormal. Next, Respondent 143: also 'a' so Abnormal. Respondent 62: 'a' again. Respondent 122: 'a' as well. Respondent 115: 'c' which is Normal. Respondent 5: 'a' so Abnormal. Respondent 24: 'c' which is Normal. Respondent 76: 'b' which is Inconclusive. Respondent 57: 'b' again Inconclusive. Respondent 104: 'b' Inconclusive. Respondent 63: 'c' Normal. 

So the respondents with Test Results 'Abnormal' are 126, 143, 62, 122, and 5. Let me double-check each one to make sure I didn't miss any. Yep, those are the ones with 'a' in Test Results. The answer should be their IDs separated by commas.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents with blood type = 'O-' and hospital = 'HOSP_95'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task. The user wants a list of respondents who have blood type 'O-' and are in hospital 'HOSP_95'. 

First, I need to check the data schema to understand how these fields are represented. The blood type is an MCQ with options A to H. From the questions section, Blood Type options are: A. A+, B. A-, C. AB+, D. AB-, E. B+, F. B-, G. O+, H. O-. So 'O-' corresponds to option H.

Next, the hospital is an open-ended field, so we look for exact matches to 'HOSP_95' in the Hospital field of each respondent.

Now, I'll go through each respondent in the data:

- Respondent 149: Blood Type is 'a' (A+), Hospital is HOSP_149. Doesn't match.
- Respondent 95: Blood Type is 'b' (A-), Hospital is HOSP_95. Blood type isn't O- (H), so no.
- Respondent 122: Blood Type 'h' (O-), Hospital HOSP_122. Hospital doesn't match.
- Respondent 142: Blood Type 'g' (O+), Hospital HOSP_142. Not matching.
- Respondent 136: Blood Type 'a' (A+), Hospital HOSP_136. Nope.
- Respondent 89: Blood Type 'f' (B-), Hospital HOSP_89. Doesn't fit.
- Respondent 109: Blood Type 'd' (AB-), Hospital HOSP_109. Not a match.
- Respondent 141: Blood Type 'c' (AB+), Hospital HOSP_141. No.
- Respondent 85: Blood Type 'g' (O+), Hospital HOSP_85. Still not.

Looking through all respondents, none have both blood type H (O-) and hospital HOSP_95. The only respondent in HOSP_95 is Respondent 95, but their blood type is B (A-). So the answer should be none.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose room number is between 205 and 421.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task. I need to find all respondents whose room number is between 205 and 421. Let me start by understanding the data structure.

First, looking at the questions, the Room Number is an open-ended field. So the responses will have numerical values. The task is to check which respondents have a room number that's greater than or equal to 205 and less than or equal to 421.

Now, I'll go through each respondent's data and check their room number. Let's list them out one by one.

Respondent 117: Room Number 249. 249 is between 205 and 421. So include 117.

Respondent 70: Room 424. Wait, 424 is higher than 421, so exclude.

Respondent 79: Room 300. That's within the range. Include 79.

Respondent 65: Room 211. Yes, between 205 and 421. Include 65.

Respondent 60: Room 494. That's way above 421. Exclude.

Respondent 31: Room 134. Below 205. Exclude.

Respondent 50: Room 440. 440 is higher than 421. Exclude.

Respondent 81: Room 234. Within range. Include 81.

Respondent 138: Room 133. Below 205. Exclude.

Respondent 48: Room 263. That's within the range. Include 48.

So compiling the respondent numbers: 117, 79, 65, 81, 48. Let me double-check each room number to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

117: 249 – yes. 79: 300 – yes. 65: 211 – yes. 81: 234 – yes. 48: 263 – yes. The others are either below 205 or above 421. So the final list should be these five respondents.

<task>
Find all respondents whose age is between 32 and 67.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task. I need to find all respondents whose age is between 32 and 67. Let me start by looking at the data provided.

First, I'll go through each respondent's age. The age is an open-ended question, so the responses are numerical values. The task is to check which of these ages fall within the range of 32 to 67, inclusive.

Looking at Respondent 56: Age 73. That's above 67, so exclude.

Respondent 124: Age 57. 57 is between 32 and 67. Include.

Respondent 71: Age 52. That's within the range. Include.

Respondent 135: Age 52. Also within range. Include.

Respondent 73: Age 21. Below 32. Exclude.

Respondent 26: Age 48. Within range. Include.

Respondent 50: Age 79. Over 67. Exclude.

Respondent 76: Age 70. Also over 67. Exclude.

So the respondents that meet the criteria are 124, 71, 135, and 26. Let me double-check each age again to be sure. Yes, 57, 52, 52, and 48 are all between 32 and 67. The others are either too young or too old. So the answer should be their respondent numbers.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose room number is between 172 and 364.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task. I need to find all respondents whose room number is between 172 and 364. Let me start by understanding the data structure.

First, looking at the questions, the Room Number is an open-ended field. So the responses are numerical values. The task is to check which respondents have room numbers in the range 172 to 364, inclusive.

Now, I'll go through each respondent's data and check their room number. Let's list them out one by one.

Respondent 93: Room Number 326. 326 is between 172 and 364. So that's a yes.

Respondent 46: Room 108. 108 is below 172. No.

Respondent 78: Room 310. 310 is within the range. Include.

Respondent 4: Room 131. 131 is less than 172. Exclude.

Respondent 137: Room 401. 401 is above 364. Exclude.

Respondent 33: Room 408. Also above 364. No.

Respondent 71: Room 212. 212 is between 172 and 364. Include.

Respondent 12: Room 428. That's over 364. Exclude.

So the respondents meeting the criteria are 93, 78, and 71. Let me double-check the numbers to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 326, 310, 212—all are within 172-364. The others are either below or above. Yep, that seems right.

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").

<task>
Which respondents have a calculated length of stay greater than 11 days and do not have a medical condition of 'Asthma'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find which respondents have a length of stay greater than 11 days and do not have a medical condition of 'Asthma'. 

First, I need to understand the data provided. The questions section tells me that the Medical Condition is an MCQ with options A. Arthritis, B. Asthma, C. Cancer, D. Diabetes, E. Hypertension, F. Obesity. So, in the responses, if a respondent's Medical Condition is 'b', that maps to Asthma.

Next, the length of stay is calculated by the difference between Discharge Date and Date of Admission. Both dates are in the format YYYY-MM-DD. I need to calculate the number of days between these two dates for each respondent and check if it's more than 11 days.

Let's go through each respondent one by one.

Starting with Respondent 142:
- Date of Admission: 2019-11-06
- Discharge Date: 2020-02-09
Calculating the days between these dates. Let's see, from November 6 to February 9. November has 30 days, so 30 - 6 = 24 days left in November. Then December has 31, January 31, and February 9. Total days: 24 + 31 + 31 + 9 = 95 days. That's way more than 11. Now check Medical Condition: 'b' which is Asthma. But the task is to exclude those with Asthma. So this respondent is out.

Respondent 75:
- Admission: 2021-02-12
- Discharge: 2021-01-26. Wait, that's a problem. The discharge date is before the admission date. That can't be right. Maybe a typo? Let me check again. The admission is 2021-02-12 and discharge is 2021-01-26. That's impossible; discharge is before admission. Maybe the dates are swapped? Or perhaps a data entry error. In that case, the length of stay would be negative, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps this is an error, but according to the data given, the length is negative, so it's less than 11 days. So this respondent doesn't qualify. Also, Medical Condition is 'f' which is Obesity. So even if the dates were correct, but since the stay is negative, it's not considered. So skip this one.

Respondent 33:
- Admission: 2022-06-24
- Discharge: 2022-07-25
Calculating days: From June 24 to July 25. June has 30 days, so 30 -24 = 6 days in June. Then 25 days in July. Total 6 +25 = 31 days. That's more than 11. Medical Condition is 'd' which is Diabetes. So this respondent meets both criteria. So include them.

Respondent 126:
- Admission: 2021-01-03
- Discharge: 2020-12-08. Again, discharge is before admission. 2020 is before 2021. So the discharge is a year earlier. That's another data inconsistency. Length would be negative. So no. Medical Condition is 'a' which is Arthritis. But since the stay is negative, doesn't qualify.

Respondent 27:
- Admission: 2021-11-21
- Discharge: 2021-11-22. That's 1 day. So length is 1 day. Less than 11. Medical Condition is 'a' (Arthritis). Doesn't meet the length requirement.

So the only respondent that meets both conditions (length >11 days and not Asthma) is Respondent 33. Let me double-check their dates again. June 24 to July 25. June has 30 days, so 6 days in June (24th to 30th inclusive is 7 days? Wait, 24th to 24th is 1 day. So from 24th to 30th is 7 days (24,25,26,27,28,29,30). Then July 1 to 25 is 25 days. Total 7 +25 = 32 days. Yes, definitely over 11. And Medical Condition is 'd' which is Diabetes. So correct.

So the answer is Respondent 33.

<task>
Which respondents have a calculated length of stay greater than 7 days and do not have a medical condition of 'Arthritis'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find which respondents have a length of stay greater than 7 days and do not have a medical condition of 'Arthritis'. 

First, I need to understand the data provided. The questions section tells me that the Medical Condition is an MCQ with options A to F, where A is Arthritis. So, any respondent with Medical Condition 'a' has Arthritis. The Date of Admission and Discharge Date are open-ended, so I need to calculate the length of stay by finding the difference between these two dates for each respondent.

Let's go through each respondent one by one.

Starting with Respondent 147:
- Medical Condition is 'a', which maps to Arthritis. Since the task is to exclude those with Arthritis, this respondent is out. So we can skip further checks here.

Respondent 73:
- Medical Condition is 'd', which according to the schema is Diabetes. That's good because it's not Arthritis. Now, calculate the length of stay. Date of Admission is 2024-01-05 and Discharge Date is 2024-03-26. Let's compute the days between these dates. From January 5 to March 26, 2024. January has 31 days, so from Jan 5 to Jan 31 is 26 days. February 2024 is a leap year, so 29 days. March 1 to March 26 is 26 days. Total days: 26 + 29 + 26 = 81 days. That's way more than 7, so this respondent meets both criteria.

Respondent 121:
- Medical Condition is 'e', which is Hypertension. Not Arthritis. Date of Admission: 2021-10-27, Discharge: 2021-11-21. October has 31 days, so from Oct 27 to Oct 31 is 5 days. November 1 to 21 is 21 days. Total 5 +21 = 26 days. More than 7. So this respondent qualifies.

Respondent 123:
- Medical Condition is 'c', which is Cancer. Not Arthritis. Dates: Admission 2019-10-13, Discharge 2019-12-21. October 13-31: 19 days. November: 30 days. December 1-21: 21 days. Total 19+30+21=70 days. Definitely over 7. So this one is included.

Respondent 113:
- Medical Condition is 'e', Hypertension. Not Arthritis. Admission date 2021-05-14, Discharge 2021-03-20. Wait, that's a problem. The discharge date is before the admission date. That can't be right. Maybe a typo? Let me check again. The admission is 2021-05-14 and discharge is 2021-03-20. That's impossible. So this data entry is invalid. The discharge date is two months before admission. Therefore, the length of stay would be negative, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps this is an error in the data. In such cases, how should we handle it? The question asks for length of stay greater than 7 days. If the dates are invalid, maybe we should exclude this respondent. Alternatively, maybe the dates are swapped. But since we have to work with the data as given, we can't assume that. So the length of stay here would be negative, which is not greater than 7. So this respondent doesn't meet the criteria.

So the qualifying respondents are 73, 121, and 123. Let me double-check each:

- Respondent 73: Correct, 81 days, condition Diabetes.
- Respondent 121: 26 days, condition Hypertension.
- Respondent 123: 70 days, condition Cancer.
- Respondent 113: Invalid dates, excluded.

Therefore, the answer should list these three respondents.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents who are treated by the same doctor as the patient in room '272' and were admitted for the same admission type.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to list all respondents who are treated by the same doctor as the patient in room '272' and were admitted for the same admission type. 

First, I need to find out which patient is in room 272. Let me go through each respondent's data to check their room number.

Looking at the responses:

- Respondent 48: Room 263
- Respondent 14: Room 255
- Respondent 65: Room 211
- Respondent 123: Room 328
- Respondent 30: Room 272 → Found the patient in room 272. 

Now, I need to note the doctor and admission type for this patient. 

Respondent 30's doctor is DOC_30, and the admission type is 'b'. According to the questions, admission type options are A. Elective, B. Emergency, C. Urgent. So 'b' maps to Emergency. 

Next, I have to find all other respondents who have the same doctor (DOC_30) and the same admission type (Emergency). 

Let's check each respondent:

- Respondent 48: Doctor DOC_48, Admission Type a (Elective) → Doesn't match.
- Respondent 14: DOC_14, Admission Type a (Elective) → No.
- Respondent 65: DOC_65, a → No.
- Respondent 123: DOC_123, c (Urgent) → No.
- Respondent 30: Already the source, so maybe included? The task says ""all respondents"" so maybe yes, but need to check others.
- Respondent 17: DOC_17, a → No.
- Respondent 103: DOC_103, b (Emergency) → Same admission type but different doctor.
- Respondent 126: DOC_126, b (Emergency) → Same admission type, different doctor.
- Respondent 19: DOC_19, b (Emergency) → Same admission type, different doctor.
- Respondent 148: DOC_148, c (Urgent) → No.

So, the only respondent with doctor DOC_30 and admission type Emergency is Respondent 30 themselves. Are there any others? Let me double-check. 

Looking again through all respondents, no other entries have DOC_30 as the doctor. Therefore, the only respondent meeting both conditions is Respondent 30.

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondents have a calculated length of stay greater than 17 days and do not have a medical condition of 'Diabetes'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find which respondents have a length of stay greater than 17 days and do not have a medical condition of 'Diabetes'. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The questions section tells me that 'Medical Condition' is an MCQ with options A to F, where option D is Diabetes. The responses for each respondent include their medical condition code, which I need to map to the actual condition using the schema.

Next, I need to calculate the length of stay for each respondent. The data provides 'Date of Admission' and 'Discharge Date'. The length of stay is the number of days between these two dates. However, I should be careful with the date format. The dates are in YYYY-MM-DD format, so I can parse them as such.

Let's go through each respondent one by one.

**Respondent 39:**
- Admission Date: 2021-10-08
- Discharge Date: 2021-10-05
Wait, discharge date is before admission date? That doesn't make sense. Maybe a typo. If the discharge is before admission, the length of stay would be negative, which isn't possible. Perhaps the dates are swapped. But since the data is given as is, I have to take it as provided. The calculation would be (2021-10-05) - (2021-10-08) which is -3 days. So length of stay is 0 or invalid. Therefore, this respondent doesn't meet the >17 days criteria.

**Respondent 145:**
- Admission: 2020-11-03
- Discharge: 2020-09-04
Again, discharge is before admission. Same issue. The discharge is two months earlier. So negative days. So length of stay is negative. Doesn't qualify.

**Respondent 78:**
- Admission: 2024-01-13
- Discharge: 2024-01-22
Calculating the days: 22 - 13 = 9 days. So 9 days. Not greater than 17. Doesn't qualify.

**Respondent 22:**
- Admission: 2022-06-21
- Discharge: 2022-04-13
Again, discharge is before admission. Negative days. So invalid. Doesn't qualify.

**Respondent 64:**
- Admission: 2019-12-09
- Discharge: 2020-02-09
Let's calculate this. From December 9, 2019, to February 9, 2020. December has 31 days, so from Dec 9 to Dec 31: 22 days. January has 31 days. February 9 days. Total: 22 + 31 + 9 = 62 days. That's way more than 17 days. 

Now check the medical condition. Respondent 64's medical condition is 'd'. Looking at the schema, Medical Condition options are A. Arthritis, B. Asthma, C. Cancer, D. Diabetes, E. Hypertension, F. Obesity. So 'd' is Diabetes. But the task is to find respondents who do NOT have Diabetes. So this respondent has Diabetes, so they are excluded.

Wait, but the answer requires both conditions: length of stay >17 days AND medical condition not Diabetes. So even if the length is over 17, if they have Diabetes, they are excluded.

Looking at all respondents, none of them have a valid length of stay over 17 days except Respondent 64, but they have Diabetes. The others either have negative stays or less than 17 days. Therefore, there are no respondents that meet both criteria.

<task>
Which respondents have a calculated length of stay greater than 14 days and do not have a medical condition of 'Asthma'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find which respondents have a length of stay greater than 14 days and do not have a medical condition of 'Asthma'. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The questions section tells me that the medical condition is a multiple-choice question (MCQ) with options like Arthritis, Asthma, Cancer, Diabetes, Hypertension, Obesity. The responses use codes (a, b, c, etc.), so I need to map those to the actual conditions.

Next, the length of stay (LOS) isn't a direct field. I have to calculate it using the Date of Admission and Discharge Date. The LOS is the number of days between these two dates. If the discharge date is before the admission date, that might be an error, but I'll proceed with the calculation as given.

Let's go through each respondent:

**Respondent 143:**
- Admission: 2022-12-10
- Discharge: 2022-09-27
Wait, discharge is before admission. That's impossible. Maybe a typo? Let's check the original data. Oh, in the example, the answer was ""None"" for a different query, but here, maybe this date is a mistake. But regardless, calculating LOS: 2022-09-27 minus 2022-12-10 would be negative. So LOS is negative, which can't be right. Maybe the dates are swapped? But I have to take them as given. So LOS here is negative, so not greater than 14. So skip.

**Respondent 107:**
- Admission: 2024-01-31
- Discharge: 2024-02-02
LOS: 2 days (from Jan 31 to Feb 2 is 2 days). Not greater than 14. So no.

**Respondent 58:**
- Admission: 2020-05-22
- Discharge: 2020-06-08
Calculating the days between May 22 and June 8. May has 31 days, so from May 22 to May 31 is 9 days (including start day?), then June 1 to 8 is 8 days. Total 17 days. So LOS is 17. That's greater than 14. Medical condition is 'd', which maps to Diabetes. So not Asthma. So this respondent qualifies.

**Respondent 134:**
- Admission: 2021-12-01
- Discharge: 2022-01-15
From Dec 1, 2021 to Jan 15, 2022. December has 31 days, so 31 - 1 (since Dec 1 is start) = 30 days in Dec, plus 15 days in Jan. Total 45 days. LOS 45. Greater than 14. Medical condition is 'f' which is Obesity. Not Asthma. So this one qualifies.

**Respondent 98:**
- Admission: 2021-04-17
- Discharge: 2021-03-11
Again, discharge before admission. Negative LOS. So invalid, skip. Also, medical condition is 'b' which is Asthma. But since LOS is invalid, even if the condition wasn't Asthma, it wouldn't matter. But here, the condition is Asthma, so even if LOS was valid, it would be excluded.

**Respondent 116:**
- Admission: 2020-06-23
- Discharge: 2020-06-22
Again, discharge is before admission. LOS negative. So invalid. Medical condition 'f' (Obesity), but LOS not >14. So no.

So the qualifying respondents are 58 and 134. Let me double-check their LOS:

For Respondent 58: May 22 to June 8. Let's count days. May 22 is day 1. May 23 (2), ..., May 31 is 10 days. Then June 1 to June 8 is 8 days. Total 18 days? Wait, wait. Wait, from May 22 to May 31 inclusive is 10 days (31-22+1=10). Then June 1 to June 8 is 8 days. Total 18 days. So LOS is 18-1=17? Wait, depends on whether the discharge day is counted as a full day. If admission is on day 0, discharge on day n, then LOS is n days. For example, admitted on day 1, discharged same day: LOS 0? Or 1? Hmm. Let me use a date difference calculator. From 2020-05-22 to 2020-06-08: the number of days is (June 8 - May 22) = 17 days. Because May has 31 days: 31 -22 =9 days remaining in May, plus 8 in June: 9+8=17. So LOS is 17 days. Correct.

Respondent 134: 2021-12-01 to 2022-01-15. December has 31 days. From Dec 1 to Dec 31 is 31 days. Then Jan 1 to Jan 15 is 15 days. Total 31 +15 =46 days. But wait, from Dec 1 to Jan 15 inclusive? Let's calculate: (2022-01-15 - 2021-12-01) = 45 days. So LOS is 45 days. Definitely over 14.

So both 58 and 134 meet the criteria. Their medical conditions are Diabetes and Obesity, neither is Asthma. So the answer should be Respondent 58 and 134.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondents have a calculated length of stay greater than 18 days and do not have a medical condition of 'Diabetes'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find which respondents have a length of stay greater than 18 days and do not have a medical condition of 'Diabetes'. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The questions section tells me that 'Medical Condition' is an MCQ with options A to F, where D is Diabetes. So, any respondent with Medical Condition 'D' should be excluded.

Next, the length of stay (LOS) is calculated by the difference between Discharge Date and Date of Admission. Both dates are in the format YYYY-MM-DD. I'll need to parse these dates for each respondent, calculate the days between them, and check if it's more than 18.

Let's go through each respondent one by one:

**Respondent 77:**
- Date of Admission: 2024-04-05
- Discharge Date: 2024-02-10
Wait, the discharge date is before the admission date here. That doesn't make sense. Maybe a typo? Let me check again. The admission is April 5, 2024, discharge February 10, 2024. That's impossible. Maybe the dates are swapped? Or perhaps a mistake in data entry. Since the discharge is before admission, the LOS would be negative, which isn't possible. So maybe this is an error, but according to the data, LOS would be negative, so it's not greater than 18. So we can skip this one.

**Respondent 110:**
- Admission: 2019-12-12
- Discharge: 2019-08-21
Again, discharge is before admission. Another data error. LOS negative. So no.

**Respondent 79:**
- Admission: 2021-01-07
- Discharge: 2020-12-18
Again, discharge before admission. Negative LOS. Not valid. Skip.

**Respondent 146:**
- Admission: 2021-03-04
- Discharge: 2021-02-06
Discharge before admission. Negative. Skip.

**Respondent 16:**
- Admission: 2020-01-24
- Discharge: 2019-12-13
Again, discharge before admission. Negative. Skip.

**Respondent 26:**
- Admission: 2020-05-04
- Discharge: 2020-07-14
Here, discharge is after admission. Let's calculate the days. From May 4 to July 14. May has 31 days, so May 4 to May 31 is 27 days. June has 30 days, so 27 + 30 = 57. Then July 14 is 14 days. Total 27 + 30 +14 = 71 days. Wait, but May 4 to July 14 is actually 71 days. So LOS is 71 days. That's way more than 18. Now check medical condition. Medical Condition is D (Diabetes). So this respondent has Diabetes, so they should be excluded.

**Respondent 54:**
- Admission: 2023-12-23
- Discharge: 2024-02-07
Calculate LOS. From 2023-12-23 to 2024-02-07. December has 31 days, so from 23rd to 31st is 8 days. January has 31 days. February 7 days. Total 8 +31 +7 = 46 days. LOS 46. Medical Condition is D (Diabetes). Exclude.

**Respondent 55:**
- Admission: 2024-03-17
- Discharge: 2024-04-22
March 17 to April 22. March has 31 days, so 31-17=14 days in March, plus 22 in April. Total 14+22=36 days. LOS 36. Medical Condition is E (Hypertension). Not Diabetes. So this one meets both conditions.

**Respondent 68:**
- Admission: 2022-08-22
- Discharge: 2022-09-18
August 22 to September 18. August has 31 days, so 31-22=9 days in August, plus 18 in September. Total 9+18=27 days. LOS 27. Medical Condition is C (Cancer). Not Diabetes. So this one qualifies.

**Respondent 21:**
- Admission: 2021-11-13
- Discharge: 2021-08-19
Discharge before admission. Negative. Skip.

**Respondent 41:**
- Admission: 2021-09-10
- Discharge: 2021-09-18
That's 8 days (from 10th to 18th inclusive is 9 days? Wait, 18-10=8 days, but including both dates is 9 days. Wait, need to calculate exact days. From Sept 10 to Sept 18: 18-10 = 8 days, but since both days are counted, it's 8 days. So LOS is 8. Less than 18. Doesn't qualify.

**Respondent 62:**
- Admission: 2024-02-22
- Discharge: 2024-02-04
Discharge before admission. Negative. Skip.

So after checking all, the respondents that meet the criteria are:

- Respondent 55: LOS 36 days, Medical Condition E (Hypertension)
- Respondent 68: LOS 27 days, Medical Condition C (Cancer)

Wait, but let me double-check the Medical Conditions. The Medical Condition options are:

A. Arthritis B. Asthma C. Cancer D. Diabetes E. Hypertension F. Obesity

So Respondent 55's Medical Condition is E, which is Hypertension (not Diabetes), so included. Respondent 68's is C, Cancer, also not Diabetes. Both qualify.

So the answer should be Respondents 55 and 68.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Find all respondents with test results = 'Normal', blood type = 'A-', and whose age is greater than 54.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The goal is to find all respondents who meet three conditions: their test results are 'Normal', their blood type is 'A-', and their age is greater than 54. 

First, I need to understand the data structure from the provided questions and responses. Let's look at the schema for each relevant field.

Test Results: The options are A. Abnormal, B. Inconclusive, C. Normal. So, if a respondent has 'c' in their Test Results, that maps to 'Normal'.

Blood Type: The options are A. A+, B. A-, C. AB+, D. AB-, E. B+, F. B-, G. O+, H. O-. So, blood type 'B' corresponds to 'A-'.

Age is an open-ended field, so we just need to check if the value is greater than 54.

Now, let's go through each respondent in the responses and check these three conditions.

Starting with Respondent 142:
- Test Results: 'a' → Abnormal. Doesn't meet the 'Normal' condition. So, skip.

Respondent 20:
- Test Results: 'c' → Normal. Good.
- Blood Type: 'b' → A-. That's correct.
- Age: 65. 65 >54. All conditions met. So, this respondent qualifies.

Respondent 41:
- Test Results: 'a' → Abnormal. Doesn't meet. Skip.

Respondent 1:
- Test Results: 'a' → Abnormal. Skip.

Respondent 105:
- Test Results: 'a' → Abnormal. Skip.

Respondent 116:
- Test Results: 'c' → Normal.
- Blood Type: 'g' → O+. Not A-. So, doesn't meet.

Respondent 121:
- Test Results: 'c' → Normal.
- Blood Type: 'f' → B-. Not A-. So, no.

So, only Respondent 20 meets all three conditions. Let me double-check their details again to be sure.

Respondent 20:
- Age: 65 (which is >54)
- Blood Type: 'b' → A-
- Test Results: 'c' → Normal.

Yes, that's correct. No other respondents fit all three criteria. The answer should be Respondent 20.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Find all respondents with hospital = 'HOSP_109', test results = 'Abnormal', and whose billing amount is less than 20228.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The goal is to find all respondents who meet three conditions: their hospital is HOSP_109, their test results are Abnormal, and their billing amount is less than 20,228.

First, I need to go through each respondent in the provided data and check these three criteria. Let's start by looking at each respondent one by one.

Starting with Respondent 9. Their hospital is HOSP_09, which doesn't match HOSP_109. Test results are 'b', which according to the schema maps to Inconclusive. Billing amount is 6176, which is less than 20,228. But since the hospital doesn't match, this one is out.

Next, Respondent 60. Hospital is HOSP_60. Not matching. Test results 'c' is Normal. Billing 37735, which is higher. So no.

Respondent 74: Hospital HOSP_74. Test results 'a' is Abnormal. Billing 40783. Hospital doesn't match, so no.

Respondent 73: Hospital HOSP_73. Test results 'c' is Normal. Billing 49943. Doesn't meet any criteria.

Respondent 117: Hospital HOSP_117. Test results 'b' is Inconclusive. Billing 20228. Wait, the task says billing less than 20228. This is exactly 20228, so it's not less. So no.

Respondent 19: Hospital HOSP_19. Test results 'c' is Normal. Billing 10352. Hospital doesn't match.

Respondent 68: Hospital HOSP_68. Test results 'c' is Normal. Billing 19183. Hospital not matching.

Respondent 51: Hospital HOSP_51. Test results 'c' is Normal. Billing 14300. Doesn't meet.

Respondent 109: Let's check. Hospital is HOSP_109. That's a match. Test results are 'c', which is Normal. So even though the hospital matches, the test result isn't Abnormal. Billing is 35522, which is higher than 20228. So this doesn't meet all three conditions.

Wait, did I miss any respondents? Let me check again. The respondents listed are 9, 60, 74, 73, 117, 19, 68, 51, 109. That's all. None of them have hospital HOSP_109 and test results Abnormal. The only one with HOSP_109 is Respondent 109, but their test result is Normal. So there are no respondents that meet all three criteria. The answer should be None.

<task>
Find all respondents with medical condition = 'Cancer', gender = 'Male', and whose billing amount is greater than 31689.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The goal is to find all respondents who meet three criteria: their medical condition is Cancer, their gender is Male, and their billing amount is greater than 31,689.

First, I need to refer back to the questions section to understand how each response is coded. For the medical condition, the options are A. Arthritis, B. Asthma, C. Cancer, D. Diabetes, E. Hypertension, F. Obesity. So, if a respondent's Medical Condition is 'c', that maps to Cancer. Similarly, for Gender, the options are A. Female and B. Male. So, a response of 'b' for Gender means Male.

Next, the billing amount is an open-ended field, so I just need to check if the numerical value is greater than 31,689.

Now, I'll go through each respondent in the responses section and check these three conditions.

Starting with Respondent 140:
- Medical Condition: c → Cancer. Good.
- Gender: b → Male. Good.
- Billing Amount: 25,426. This is less than 31,689. So, doesn't meet the billing condition. Exclude.

Respondent 58:
- Medical Condition: d → Diabetes. Not Cancer. Exclude.

Respondent 39:
- Medical Condition: d → Diabetes. Exclude.

Respondent 69:
- Medical Condition: f → Obesity. Exclude.

Respondent 37:
- Medical Condition: d → Diabetes. Exclude.

Respondent 19:
- Medical Condition: c → Cancer. Good.
- Gender: a → Female. Doesn't meet the Male requirement. Exclude.

Wait, that's all the respondents. Let me double-check each one to make sure I didn't miss any.

Looking again at Respondent 58: Billing is 37,952. But their medical condition is Diabetes, so no. Respondent 69's billing is 46,957, which is over 31,689, but their medical condition is Obesity. So no. Respondent 19 has Cancer but is Female. So none of the respondents meet all three criteria. Therefore, the answer should be None.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents who are treated by the same doctor as the patient in room '245' and were admitted for the same admission type.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The question is asking to list all respondents who are treated by the same doctor as the patient in room '245' and were admitted for the same admission type. 

First, I need to find out which patient is in room 245. Looking at the responses, I'll check each respondent's room number. 

Starting with Respondent 43: Room Number is 468. Not 245.
Respondent 79: Room 300. Nope.
Respondent 146: Room 245. There we go. So the patient in room 245 is Respondent 146. 

Now, I need to note the doctor and admission type for Respondent 146. The Doctor is DOC_146, and the Admission Type is 'b'. But wait, the Admission Type is an MCQ. The question for Admission Type is MCQ: A. Elective B. Emergency C. Urgent. So 'b' maps to Emergency. 

So, the criteria are: find all respondents where Doctor is DOC_146 and Admission Type is Emergency (which is 'b' in the data). 

Now, let's go through each respondent again:

Respondent 43: Doctor is DOC_43, Admission Type 'a' (Elective). Doesn't match.
Respondent 79: Doctor DOC_79, Admission Type 'c' (Urgent). No match.
Respondent 146: Doctor DOC_146, Admission Type 'b' (Emergency). This is the original patient, but the task says ""list all respondents"" including this one? The question says ""treated by the same doctor as the patient in room 245"", so if the patient in room 245 is included, then yes. But need to check others.

Respondent 74: Doctor DOC_74, Admission Type 'b' (Emergency). Doctor doesn't match DOC_146.
Respondent 113: Doctor DOC_113, Admission Type 'a' (Elective). Doesn't match.

Wait, are there any other respondents in the data? The given responses are for 43,79,146,74,113. So only these five. 

So the only respondent that matches both Doctor DOC_146 and Admission Type Emergency (b) is Respondent 146 themselves. Are there any others? Let me check again. 

No, others have different doctors. So the answer would be just Respondent 146. But wait, the task says ""list all respondents"" who meet both conditions. So if there's only one, then that's the answer. 

But wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check. The patient in room 245 is Respondent 146. Their doctor is DOC_146. So we need to find all respondents with Doctor = DOC_146 and Admission Type = 'b' (Emergency). 

Looking at all respondents again:

- Respondent 146: Doctor DOC_146, Admission Type 'b' → matches.
- Any others? The other respondents have different doctors. So no. 

Therefore, the answer is Respondent 146. But the output format requires a comma-separated list of respondent numbers. So the answer is ""146"".

</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The question is asking to list all respondents who are treated by the same doctor as the patient in room '300' and were admitted for the same admission type. 

First, I need to find out which patient is in room 300. Looking through the responses:

Respondent 104 has Room Number: 300. So that's the starting point. Now, I need to note the doctor and admission type for this respondent.

For Respondent 104:
- Doctor: DOC_104
- Admission Type: a (from the MCQ, Admission Type options are A. Elective, B. Emergency, C. Urgent). So 'a' maps to Elective.

Now, the task is to find all other respondents who have the same doctor (DOC_104) and the same admission type (Elective). 

Looking at each respondent:

- Respondent 120: Doctor DOC_120, Admission Type c (Urgent). Doesn't match.
- Respondent 78: Doctor DOC_78, Admission Type c (Urgent). Doesn't match.
- Respondent 104: This is the one in room 300. We need others, so skip.
- Respondent 70: Doctor DOC_70, Admission Type a (Elective). Doctor doesn't match DOC_104.
- Respondent 129: Doctor DOC_129, Admission Type a (Elective). Doctor doesn't match.
- Respondent 139: Doctor DOC_139, Admission Type c (Urgent). Doesn't match.

Wait, none of the other respondents have Doctor DOC_104. So the only one is Respondent 104 themselves. But the task says ""all respondents"" which might include the original if there are others. But in this case, there are no others. So the answer would be just Respondent 104? But the question says ""list all respondents who are treated by the same doctor as the patient in room 300"", which is DOC_104, and same admission type (Elective). So only Respondent 104 meets both conditions. But maybe the task wants to exclude the original patient? The wording isn't clear. However, the example given in the initial data had an answer of ""None"" when no respondents matched. Here, if only the original patient matches, but the task is to list others, then the answer would be none. Wait, but the task doesn't specify excluding the original. Let me check the exact wording again: ""list all respondents who are treated by the same doctor as the patient in room '300' and were admitted for the same admission type."" So it includes any respondent, including the one in room 300. But in the data, only Respondent 104 is in room 300 and has those attributes. Are there any others with the same doctor and admission type? Let me check again.

Looking at all respondents:

- Respondent 104: Doctor DOC_104, Admission Type a (Elective)
- Others: All other respondents have different doctors. So no one else has DOC_104 as their doctor. Therefore, the only respondent that meets both conditions is Respondent 104. But the task is to list all respondents, which would include 104. However, the example given in the initial data had a similar structure where the answer was ""None"" when no matches. But in this case, there is one match. Wait, but the example was looking for DOC_107 and HOSP_148, which didn't exist. Here, the patient in room 300 is Respondent 104, and the doctor is DOC_104. Are there any other respondents with DOC_104? Let me check again. All other respondents have different doctor IDs: DOC_120, DOC_78, DOC_70, DOC_129, DOC_139. So no, only Respondent 104 has DOC_104. Therefore, the answer is only Respondent 104. But the task says ""list all respondents"", so the answer would be ""104"". However, the example's answer was ""None"" when there were no matches. So in this case, since there is one match, the answer should be ""104"".

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents who are treated by the same doctor as the patient in room '268' and were admitted for the same admission type.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The question is asking to list all respondents who are treated by the same doctor as the patient in room '268' and were admitted for the same admission type. 

First, I need to find out which patient is in room 268. Let me go through the responses.

Looking at the responses, Respondent 113 has Room Number: 268. So that's the patient we need to start with. Now, I need to note their doctor and admission type. 

For Respondent 113:
- Doctor: DOC_113
- Admission Type: a (since the Admission Type question is MCQ with options A. Elective, B. Emergency, C. Urgent). So 'a' maps to Elective.

Now, the task is to find all other respondents who have the same doctor (DOC_113) and the same admission type (Elective, which is 'a' in the data). 

Let me go through each respondent to check these two fields.

Respondent 113: Already the starting point. Doctor DOC_113, Admission Type a. But we need others, so maybe include or exclude? The task says ""treated by the same doctor as the patient in room 268"", so including the patient themselves might depend on interpretation, but the example given in the initial problem had an answer of ""None"" when no one matched, so perhaps we need to list all including or excluding? Let's check.

Looking at other respondents:

Respondent 21: Doctor DOC_21, Admission Type b. Doesn't match.

Respondent 11: Doctor DOC_11, Admission Type b. No.

Respondent 111: Doctor DOC_111, Admission Type b. No.

Respondent 83: Doctor DOC_83, Admission Type c. No.

Respondent 65: Doctor DOC_65, Admission Type a. Doctor doesn't match.

Respondent 7: Doctor DOC_07, Admission Type b. No.

Respondent 24: Doctor DOC_24, Admission Type b. No.

Respondent 59: Doctor DOC_59, Admission Type c. No.

Respondent 148: Doctor DOC_148, Admission Type c. No.

Respondent 6: Doctor DOC_06, Admission Type a. Doctor doesn't match.

Respondent 69: Doctor DOC_69, Admission Type b. No.

So, the only respondent with Doctor DOC_113 and Admission Type a is Respondent 113 themselves. But the task says ""list all respondents"" who meet the criteria. If the question includes the original patient, then 113 would be the answer. If not, then there are none. However, in the example given, when the query was for doctor DOC_107 and hospital HOSP_148, the answer was ""None"" even though there was a respondent 148 with HOSP_148 but different doctor. So perhaps the task is to list others, not including the original. Wait, but in the example, the answer was ""None"" because no one had both doctor DOC_107 and HOSP_148. 

In this case, the original patient (113) is in room 268, has doctor DOC_113 and admission type a. Are there any other respondents with DOC_113 and a? From the data provided, no. So the answer would be only Respondent 113. But the task says ""list all respondents"", which could include the original. However, sometimes such questions might be looking for others, but the example answer included ""None"" when there were no matches. Let me check the data again to confirm.

Looking again through all respondents, no one else has Doctor DOC_113. So the only one is Respondent 113. But the task is to list all respondents who are treated by the same doctor as the patient in room 268 (which is DOC_113) and same admission type (Elective/a). So Respondent 113 is the only one. However, sometimes such questions might exclude the original patient, but the example didn't have that scenario. The example's answer was ""None"" because there were no matches. Here, if the original is included, the answer would be 113. If not, then none. But the task doesn't specify to exclude the original. So I think the answer is Respondent 113.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondents have a calculated length of stay greater than 6 days and do not have a medical condition of 'Cancer'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find which respondents have a length of stay greater than 6 days and do not have a medical condition of 'Cancer'. 

First, I need to understand how to calculate the length of stay. The data provided includes 'Date of Admission' and 'Discharge Date' for each respondent. The length of stay would be the number of days between these two dates. 

But wait, the dates are in different formats. Let me check the responses. For example, Respondent 45 has Date of Admission as 2022-10-12 and Discharge Date as 2022-09-25. Wait, that's strange. The discharge date is before the admission date? That can't be right. Maybe it's a typo. Let me check other respondents. 

Looking at Respondent 121: Admission 2021-10-27, Discharge 2021-11-21. That's a positive duration. Respondent 133: Admission 2023-10-15, Discharge 2024-01-02. That's a longer stay. Respondent 114: Admission 2024-01-04, Discharge 2023-11-08. Again, discharge is before admission. That's impossible. Maybe the dates are swapped, or there's a data entry error. Hmm. Similarly, Respondent 72: Admission 2020-05-15, Discharge 2020-06-14. That's a positive duration.

So, for Respondents 45 and 114, the discharge date is before the admission date. That might be a mistake. But since the data is given as is, I have to work with it. Let's calculate the length of stay as (Discharge Date - Admission Date). If the discharge date is earlier, the result would be negative, which would mean the length of stay is negative days, which isn't possible. So perhaps those entries are errors, but according to the problem, we have to use the data as provided. 

But the question is about length of stay greater than 6 days. So even if the dates are swapped, the absolute difference might be considered, but the problem states ""calculated length of stay"", which is (Discharge Date - Admission Date). If the discharge is before admission, the result is negative, which can't be greater than 6. So those respondents would not meet the criteria. 

So, let's process each respondent:

Starting with Respondent 45:
Admission: 2022-10-12
Discharge: 2022-09-25
Calculating the difference: September 25 is before October 12, so the days would be negative. So length of stay is negative, which is less than 6. So they don't qualify.

Respondent 121:
Admission: 2021-10-27
Discharge: 2021-11-21
Days between: From 10/27 to 11/21. Let's calculate. October has 31 days, so 27 to 31 is 4 days in October, plus 21 days in November: total 25 days. So 25 days. That's greater than 6. Now check medical condition. Medical Condition is 'e' which maps to 'Hypertension' (from the questions, Medical Condition options: A. Arthritis B. Asthma C. Cancer D. Diabetes E. Hypertension F. Obesity). So 'e' is Hypertension, not Cancer. So this respondent meets both conditions.

Respondent 133:
Admission: 2023-10-15
Discharge: 2024-01-02
Calculating the days. From 2023-10-15 to 2024-01-02. Let's compute. From October 15 to October 31: 16 days. November has 30, December 31, plus 2 days in January: 16+30+31+2 = 79 days. So 79 days, which is way more than 6. Medical condition is 'c' which is Cancer. So since the condition is Cancer, this respondent is excluded. So they don't meet the criteria.

Respondent 114:
Admission: 2024-01-04
Discharge: 2023-11-08. Again, discharge before admission. Negative days. So length of stay is negative, which is not greater than 6. So no.

Respondent 72:
Admission: 2020-05-15
Discharge: 2020-06-14. Days between: May has 31 days, so from 15th to 31st is 16 days, plus 14 days in June: 16+14=30 days. So 30 days, which is more than 6. Medical condition is 'e' (Hypertension), so not Cancer. So this respondent meets the criteria.

Wait, but let me check the medical condition for each again. For Respondent 72, Medical Condition is 'e', which is Hypertension. Correct. So they qualify.

So the respondents that meet the criteria are 121 and 72. Let me double-check:

Respondent 121: LOS 25 days, condition Hypertension. Yes.

Respondent 72: LOS 30 days, condition Hypertension. Yes.

Others either have LOS <=6 (or negative) or have Cancer (like 133). So the answer should be Respondents 121 and 72.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Find all respondents with admission type = 'Emergency', medical condition = 'Hypertension', and whose billing amount is greater than 25230.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The goal is to find all respondents who meet three criteria: admission type is 'Emergency', medical condition is 'Hypertension', and billing amount is greater than 25,230.

First, I need to understand each of these fields based on the questions section. 

Starting with the admission type. The question for admission type is MCQ with options A. Elective, B. Emergency, C. Urgent. So, in the responses, if a respondent has Admission Type 'b', that maps to Emergency. 

Next, the medical condition. The options are A. Arthritis, B. Asthma, C. Cancer, D. Diabetes, E. Hypertension, F. Obesity. So, the medical condition code 'e' corresponds to Hypertension. 

Billing amount is an open-ended field, so we just need to check if the numerical value is greater than 25,230. 

Now, I'll go through each respondent in the responses and check these three conditions.

Looking at Respondent 150:
- Admission Type is 'a' → Elective. Doesn't meet the Emergency criteria. So skip.

Respondent 112:
- Admission Type is 'c' → Urgent. Not Emergency. Skip.

Respondent 126:
- Admission Type is 'b' → Emergency. Good. 
- Medical Condition is 'a' → Arthritis. Not Hypertension. So no.

Respondent 24:
- Admission Type is 'b' → Emergency. 
- Medical Condition is 'd' → Diabetes. Not Hypertension. Doesn't meet.

Respondent 121:
- Admission Type is 'b' → Emergency.
- Medical Condition is 'e' → Hypertension. That's a match. 
- Billing Amount is 50119. Check if 50119 > 25230. Yes. So this respondent qualifies.

Respondent 90:
- Admission Type is 'c' → Urgent. Not Emergency. Skip.

Respondent 105:
- Admission Type is 'a' → Elective. Doesn't meet.

So the only respondent that meets all three conditions is Respondent 121. Let me double-check their details again to be sure. Admission Type 'b' is Emergency, Medical Condition 'e' is Hypertension, and Billing Amount 50119 which is indeed greater than 25,230. Yep, that's correct.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondents have a calculated length of stay greater than 15 days and do not have a medical condition of 'Obesity'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find which respondents have a length of stay greater than 15 days and do not have a medical condition of 'Obesity'. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The questions section tells me that the Medical Condition is an MCQ with options A to F, where F is Obesity. So, any respondent with Medical Condition 'f' should be excluded.

Next, the length of stay is calculated by the difference between Discharge Date and Date of Admission. Both dates are in the format YYYY-MM-DD. I'll need to parse these dates for each respondent, calculate the number of days between them, and check if it's more than 15.

Let's go through each respondent one by one.

Starting with Respondent 83:
- Date of Admission: 2019-06-15
- Discharge Date: 2019-11-29
Calculating the days between these dates. Let's see, from June 15 to November 29. June has 30 days, so June 15 to June 30 is 15 days. Then July (31), August (31), September (30), October (31), November 29. So 15 + 31 +31+30+31+29 = 167 days. That's way over 15. Medical Condition is 'a', which maps to Arthritis. So this respondent meets the criteria.

Respondent 27:
Admission: 2021-11-21, Discharge: 2021-11-22. That's 1 day. So length of stay is 1, which is not greater than 15. Exclude.

Respondent 42:
Admission: 2019-08-16, Discharge: 2019-08-05. Wait, discharge date is before admission? That might be a typo, but assuming the dates are correct, the length would be negative. Maybe a data entry error. Since the discharge is before admission, perhaps the stay is considered 0 days. So not over 15. Also, Medical Condition is 'c' (Cancer). So even if the dates are correct, the length isn't over 15. Exclude.

Respondent 85:
Admission: 2022-10-29, Discharge: 2022-11-20. October has 31 days, so 2 days in October (29th to 31st is 2 days?), then 20 days in November. Total 22 days. Medical Condition 'c' (Cancer). So 22 days >15 and condition is not Obesity. Include.

Respondent 106:
Admission: 2020-11-18, Discharge: 2021-01-16. From November 18 to November 30: 12 days. December 31, January 16. Total 12+31+16=59 days. Medical Condition 'c' (Cancer). Include.

Respondent 127:
Admission: 2020-08-21, Discharge: 2020-10-08. August 21-31: 10 days. September 30, October 8. Total 10+30+8=48 days. Medical Condition 'b' (Asthma). Include.

Respondent 74:
Admission: 2021-02-07, Discharge: 2021-06-03. February 2021 has 28 days. 28-7=21 days in Feb, March 31, April 30, May 31, June 3. Total 21+31+30+31+3=116 days. Medical Condition 'a' (Arthritis). Include.

Respondent 103:
Admission: 2023-10-11, Discharge: 2024-01-19. From October 11 to October 31: 20 days. November 30, December 31, January 19. Total 20+30+31+19=100 days. Medical Condition 'f' (Obesity). Exclude because of Obesity.

Respondent 141:
Admission: 2020-10-26, Discharge: 2021-02-04. October 26-31: 5 days. November 30, December 31, January 31, February 4. Total 5+30+31+31+4=101 days. Medical Condition 'b' (Asthma). Include.

Respondent 10:
Admission: 2022-08-22, Discharge: 2022-11-02. August 22-31: 9 days. September 30, October 31, November 2. Total 9+30+31+2=72 days. Medical Condition 'b' (Asthma). Include.

Now, compiling the list of respondents who meet both conditions (length >15 days and Medical Condition not Obesity):

- 83: Included
- 85: Included
- 106: Included
- 127: Included
- 74: Included
- 141: Included
- 10: Included

Wait, but need to check each one's Medical Condition again. For example, Respondent 103 was excluded because of Obesity. The others have conditions like Arthritis, Cancer, Asthma, which are not Obesity. So the final list is 83,85,106,127,74,141,10. But wait, let me check each:

Respondent 83: Medical Condition 'a' (Arthritis) – correct.
85: 'c' (Cancer) – correct.
106: 'c' (Cancer) – correct.
127: 'b' (Asthma) – correct.
74: 'a' (Arthritis) – correct.
141: 'b' (Asthma) – correct.
10: 'b' (Asthma) – correct.

So all these are included. Now, their respondent numbers are 83,85,106,127,74,141,10. But need to list them in order as per the data. The order in the data is 83,27,42,85,106,127,74,103,141,10. So the qualifying ones are 83,85,106,127,74,141,10. 

Wait, but Respondent 42's discharge date is before admission. That's a data inconsistency. But according to the dates given, the discharge is 2019-08-05 and admission is 2019-08-16. So discharge is 11 days before admission. That's impossible, so perhaps a typo. But the problem doesn't mention handling such errors, so we have to take the dates as given. The length would be negative, which is less than 15, so excluded. So no problem there.

So the final list is respondents 83,85,106,127,74,141,10. But let me check each of their length of stay again to confirm:

83: 2019-06-15 to 2019-11-29. Let's calculate using date difference. Using a date calculator, from June 15 to November 29, 2019. That's 167 days. Correct.

85: 2022-10-29 to 2022-11-20. 22 days. Correct.

106: 2020-11-18 to 2021-01-16. 59 days. Correct.

127: 2020-08-21 to 2020-10-08. 48 days. Correct.

74: 2021-02-07 to 2021-06-03. 116 days. Correct.

141: 2020-10-26 to 2021-02-04. 101 days. Correct.

10: 2022-08-22 to 2022-11-02. 72 days. Correct.

All of these are over 15 days. And none have Medical Condition 'Obesity' (which is 'f'). So the answer should be the list of these respondents: 83,85,106,127,74,141,10.

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Find all respondents whose billing amount is higher than the average billing amount for all patients with the same insurance provider.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find all respondents whose billing amount is higher than the average billing amount for all patients with the same insurance provider. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The responses include each respondent's insurance provider (as an MCQ code) and their billing amount (an open-ended number). The insurance provider options are A. Aetna, B. Blue Cross, C. Cigna, D. Medicare, E. UnitedHealthcare. 

So, the plan is:
1. For each respondent, determine their insurance provider's code and map it to the actual name using the schema.
2. Calculate the average billing amount for each insurance provider.
3. Compare each respondent's billing amount to their provider's average.
4. List all respondents where their billing amount exceeds their provider's average.

Let's start by going through each respondent and noting their insurance provider and billing amount.

Looking at the data:

Respondent 23: Insurance Provider e (UnitedHealthcare), Billing 33643
Respondent 81: a (Aetna), 14681
Respondent 65: c (Cigna), 29851
Respondent 83: e (UnitedHealthcare), 25966
Respondent 30: d (Medicare), 10301
Respondent 104: c (Cigna), 4532
Respondent 132: e (UnitedHealthcare), 22356
Respondent 1: d (Medicare), 24870
Respondent 139: b (Blue Cross), 18843
Respondent 119: e (UnitedHealthcare), 6768
Respondent 106: e (UnitedHealthcare), 47909
Respondent 14: c (Cigna), 21186

Now, group them by insurance provider and calculate the average for each:

Aetna (a):
Only Respondent 81: 14,681. Average is 14,681.

Blue Cross (b):
Respondent 139: 18,843. Average is 18,843.

Cigna (c):
Respondents 65 (29,851), 104 (4,532), 14 (21,186). Total = 29,851 + 4,532 + 21,186 = 55,569. Average = 55,569 / 3 ≈ 18,523.

Medicare (d):
Respondents 30 (10,301), 1 (24,870). Total = 10,301 + 24,870 = 35,171. Average = 35,171 / 2 = 17,585.5.

UnitedHealthcare (e):
Respondents 23 (33,643), 83 (25,966), 132 (22,356), 119 (6,768), 106 (47,909). Total = 33,643 + 25,966 = 59,609; +22,356 = 81,965; +6,768 = 88,733; +47,909 = 136,642. Average = 136,642 /5 = 27,328.4.

Now, compare each respondent's billing amount to their provider's average:

Aetna (avg 14,681):
- Respondent 81: 14,681. Not higher. So no.

Blue Cross (avg 18,843):
- Respondent 139: 18,843. Equal, not higher. So no.

Cigna (avg ~18,523):
- Respondent 65: 29,851 > 18,523 → Yes.
- Respondent 104: 4,532 < → No.
- Respondent 14: 21,186 > 18,523 → Yes.

Medicare (avg 17,585.5):
- Respondent 30: 10,301 < → No.
- Respondent 1: 24,870 > 17,585.5 → Yes.

UnitedHealthcare (avg 27,328.4):
- Respondent 23: 33,643 > 27,328.4 → Yes.
- Respondent 83: 25,966 < → No.
- Respondent 132: 22,356 < → No.
- Respondent 119: 6,768 < → No.
- Respondent 106: 47,909 > 27,328.4 → Yes.

So the respondents who meet the criteria are:
- Respondent 65 (Cigna)
- Respondent 14 (Cigna)
- Respondent 1 (Medicare)
- Respondent 23 (UnitedHealthcare)
- Respondent 106 (UnitedHealthcare)

Now, list their IDs. Let me check each again:

Respondent 65: Yes (Cigna, 29,851 vs ~18,523)
Respondent 14: Yes (Cigna, 21,186 vs ~18,523)
Respondent 1: Yes (Medicare, 24,870 vs 17,585.5)
Respondent 23: Yes (UnitedHealthcare, 33,643 vs 27,328.4)
Respondent 106: Yes (UnitedHealthcare, 47,909 vs 27,328.4)

So the IDs are 65, 14, 1, 23, 106.
</think>

65, 14, 1, 23, 106",

</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to list all respondents whose age is longer than the average for their admission type and are over the age of 57. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The questions section defines each field. The responses are from various respondents with their details. 

The key points here are:
1. Calculate the average age for each admission type.
2. For each respondent, check if their age is greater than the average of their admission type.
3. Also, ensure the respondent's age is over 57.

Let me start by identifying the admission types. The Admission Type is an MCQ with options A. Elective, B. Emergency, C. Urgent. In the responses, each respondent has an Admission Type code (a, b, c). 

First, I need to group all respondents by their admission type. Then, compute the average age for each group. After that, compare each respondent's age to their group's average and check if they are over 57.

Looking at the responses:

Let's list all respondents and their admission types and ages:

Respondent 133: Admission Type b (Emergency), Age 22
Respondent 93: Admission Type b (Emergency), Age 58
Respondent 128: Admission Type a (Elective), Age 28
Respondent 114: Admission Type a (Elective), Age 81
Respondent 14: Admission Type a (Elective), Age 85
Respondent 53: Admission Type c (Urgent), Age 38
Respondent 69: Admission Type b (Emergency), Age 18
Respondent 141: Admission Type a (Elective), Age 26

Now, group them by admission type:

Elective (a):
- Respondent 128: 28
- Respondent 114: 81
- Respondent 14: 85
- Respondent 141: 26

Total ages: 28 + 81 + 85 + 26 = 220
Average: 220 / 4 = 55

Emergency (b):
- Respondent 133: 22
- Respondent 93: 58
- Respondent 69: 18

Total ages: 22 + 58 + 18 = 98
Average: 98 / 3 ≈ 32.67

Urgent (c):
- Respondent 53: 38

Average: 38

Now, check each respondent:

For Elective group (average 55):
- Respondent 128: 28 < 55 → No
- Respondent 114: 81 > 55 and age >57 → Yes
- Respondent 14: 85 >55 and age >57 → Yes
- Respondent 141: 26 <55 → No

For Emergency group (average ~32.67):
- Respondent 93: 58 >32.67 and age >57 → Yes
- Respondent 133: 22 <32.67 → No
- Respondent 69: 18 <32.67 → No

Urgent group (average 38):
- Respondent 53: 38 = 38 → Not greater, so No

So the qualifying respondents are:
- Respondent 114 (81, Elective)
- Respondent 14 (85, Elective)
- Respondent 93 (58, Emergency)

Check their ages: All are over 57. 

Now, list their respondent numbers: 114, 14, 93.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Find all respondents from 'HOSP_113' whose billing amount is greater than the average billing amount for all patients at that same hospital.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find all respondents from 'HOSP_113' whose billing amount is greater than the average billing amount for all patients at that same hospital. 

First, I need to identify all respondents in the data who are from HOSP_113. Looking at the responses section, each respondent has a 'Hospital' field. Let me go through each respondent one by one.

Checking Respondent 74: Hospital is HOSP_74. Not HOSP_113.
Respondent 113: Hospital is HOSP_113. That's one.
Respondent 125: HOSP_125. No.
Respondent 32: HOSP_32. No.
Respondent 8: HOSP_08. No.
Respondent 62: HOSP_62. No.
Respondent 41: HOSP_41. No.

So only Respondent 113 is from HOSP_113. Now, I need to calculate the average billing amount for all patients at HOSP_113. But wait, since there's only one patient (Respondent 113) in HOSP_113, the average billing amount would be their own billing amount. 

The billing amount for Respondent 113 is 19328. The average is 19328. The question asks for respondents whose billing amount is greater than the average. Since 19328 is equal to the average (not greater), there are no respondents in HOSP_113 with a billing amount above the average. 

Therefore, the answer should be none.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose billing amount is higher than the average billing amount for all patients with the same insurance provider.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find all respondents whose billing amount is higher than the average billing amount for all patients with the same insurance provider. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The questions section tells me that 'Insurance Provider' is an MCQ with options A to E, each corresponding to different providers. The 'Billing Amount' is an open-ended field, so it's a numerical value.

So, the plan is:

1. **Group respondents by their Insurance Provider.** For each provider (Aetna, Blue Cross, etc.), I need to calculate the average billing amount.
2. **Calculate the average billing amount for each group.** This means for each insurance provider, sum all the billing amounts and divide by the number of respondents in that group.
3. **Compare each respondent's billing amount to their group's average.** If a respondent's amount is higher than the average of their insurance provider's group, include them in the result.

Let's start by listing all respondents along with their insurance provider and billing amount. Then, compute the average per provider.

Looking at the responses:

- **Respondent 142**: Insurance Provider 'a' (Aetna), Billing 9586
- **Respondent 4**: 'd' (Medicare), 37406
- **Respondent 105**: 'e' (UnitedHealthcare), 29504
- **Respondent 24**: 'b' (Blue Cross), 8521
- **Respondent 58**: 'c' (Cigna), 37952
- **Respondent 30**: 'd' (Medicare), 10301
- **Respondent 119**: 'e' (UnitedHealthcare), 6768
- **Respondent 31**: 'd' (Medicare), 6734
- **Respondent 40**: 'd' (Medicare), 17696

Now, group by Insurance Provider:

- **Aetna (a)**: Only Respondent 142 (9586). Average = 9586. So no one here exceeds the average since it's the only one.
- **Blue Cross (b)**: Respondent 24 (8521). Average is 8521. No one exceeds.
- **Cigna (c)**: Respondent 58 (37952). Average is 37952. No one exceeds.
- **Medicare (d)**: Respondents 4 (37406), 30 (10301), 31 (6734), 40 (17696). Let's calculate the average here. Sum: 37406 + 10301 + 6734 + 17696 = 37406 + 10301 = 47707; 47707 + 6734 = 54441; 54441 + 17696 = 72137. Average = 72137 / 4 = 18034.25. Now compare each:
  - Respondent 4: 37406 > 18034.25 → Yes
  - Respondent 30: 10301 < 18034.25 → No
  - Respondent 31: 6734 < → No
  - Respondent 40: 17696 < 18034.25? Wait, 17696 is less than 18034.25. So only Respondent 4.
- **UnitedHealthcare (e)**: Respondents 105 (29504) and 119 (6768). Sum: 29504 + 6768 = 36272. Average = 36272 / 2 = 18136. Compare:
  - Respondent 105: 29504 > 18136 → Yes
  - Respondent 119: 6768 < → No

So the respondents who meet the criteria are Respondent 4 (Medicare) and Respondent 105 (UnitedHealthcare). Their billing amounts are higher than their respective insurance provider's average.

Now, check the output rules: list the respondent IDs as a comma-separated list. The IDs are 4 and 105. So the answer should be ""4, 105"".

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose billing amount is higher than the average billing amount for all patients with the same insurance provider.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find all respondents whose billing amount is higher than the average billing amount for all patients with the same insurance provider. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The data has two main parts: the questions (which define the schema) and the responses. The relevant fields here are Insurance Provider (MCQ) and Billing Amount (open-ended). 

The Insurance Provider options are A. Aetna, B. Blue Cross, C. Cigna, D. Medicare, E. UnitedHealthcare. Each respondent has a provider code (a to e) and a billing amount as a number.

The approach should be:

1. Calculate the average billing amount for each insurance provider.
2. For each respondent, compare their billing amount to the average of their respective provider.
3. List all respondents where their billing amount exceeds this average.

Let's start by extracting all respondents' insurance providers and billing amounts. Then, group them by provider to compute the average for each. 

Looking at the responses:

Respondent 75: Provider D (Medicare), Billing 33208
Respondent 131: E (UnitedHealthcare), 14238
Respondent 70: D (Medicare), 32643
Respondent 107: A (Aetna), 3326
Respondent 124: C (Cigna), 46814
Respondent 121: C (Cigna), 50119
Respondent 63: D (Medicare), 19973
Respondent 117: E (UnitedHealthcare), 20228
Respondent 142: A (Aetna), 9586
Respondent 38: A (Aetna), 8409
Respondent 99: A (Aetna), 2305
Respondent 49: B (Blue Cross), 25302

Now, group by provider:

Aetna (A): Respondents 107, 142, 38, 99. Billing amounts: 3326, 9586, 8409, 2305. Let's calculate the average. Sum is 3326 + 9586 = 12912; 12912 + 8409 = 21321; 21321 + 2305 = 23626. Average is 23626 / 4 = 5906.5.

Blue Cross (B): Only respondent 49 with 25302. Average is 25302, so this respondent's amount equals the average. Since the task is ""higher than"", this one doesn't count.

Cigna (C): Respondents 124 (46814) and 121 (50119). Sum is 46814 + 50119 = 96933. Average is 96933 / 2 = 48466.5. Each of these respondents has billing amounts higher than the average? Wait, 46814 is less than 48466.5, so only 50119 (Respondent 121) is higher.

Medicare (D): Respondents 75 (33208), 70 (32643), 63 (19973). Sum: 33208 + 32643 = 65851; 65851 + 19973 = 85824. Average is 85824 / 3 = 28608. Now check each: 33208 > 28608 (yes), 32643 > 28608 (yes), 19973 < 28608 (no). So respondents 75 and 70.

UnitedHealthcare (E): Respondents 131 (14238) and 117 (20228). Sum: 14238 + 20228 = 34466. Average is 34466 / 2 = 17233. Compare: 14238 < 17233 (no), 20228 > 17233 (yes). So respondent 117.

So compiling all respondents who meet the criteria:

From Aetna (A): None, since all are below or equal to 5906.5. Wait, let's check again. The Aetna group's average is 5906.5. The billing amounts are 3326, 9586, 8409, 2305. So 9586 and 8409 are both higher than 5906.5. So respondents 142 (9586) and 38 (8409). Wait, I think I made a mistake here earlier. Let me recalculate.

Aetna average: 23626 /4 = 5906.5. So any respondent in Aetna with billing >5906.5. 

Respondent 107: 3326 (no)
Respondent 142: 9586 (yes)
Respondent 38: 8409 (yes)
Respondent 99: 2305 (no)

So two respondents in Aetna: 142 and 38.

Cigna: 121 (50119) is higher than 48466.5 (average). 124 (46814) is less, so only 121.

Medicare: 75 (33208) and 70 (32643) both above 28608.

UnitedHealthcare: 117 (20228) above 17233.

Blue Cross: 49 (25302) equals average, so no.

So the final list is Respondents 142, 38, 121, 75, 70, 117.

Wait, let's check each:

Aetna: 142 (9586 >5906.5 yes), 38 (8409 >5906.5 yes). So those two.

Cigna: 121 (50119 >48466.5 yes). 124 (46814 <48466.5 no).

Medicare: 75 (33208 >28608 yes), 70 (32643 >28608 yes), 63 (19973 < no).

UnitedHealthcare: 117 (20228 >17233 yes), 131 (14238 < no).

So total respondents: 142, 38, 121, 75, 70, 117.

Now, check the original data to get their respondent numbers:

Looking back:

Respondent 142: Insurance A (Aetna), billing 9586. Yes.

Respondent 38: Insurance A (Aetna), billing 8409. Yes.

Respondent 121: Insurance C (Cigna), billing 50119. Yes.

Respondent 75: Insurance D (Medicare), 33208. Yes.

Respondent 70: Insurance D (Medicare), 32643. Yes.

Respondent 117: Insurance E (UnitedHealthcare), 20228. Yes.

So the answer should be the list of these respondents: 38,70,75,117,121,142. Wait, but the order in the data is 75,131,70,107,124,121,63,117,142,38,99,49. So the respondent numbers are 38,70,75,117,121,142. Let me check each:

38: Yes, as above.

70: Yes.

75: Yes.

117: Yes.

121: Yes.

142: Yes.

So the final list is 38,70,75,117,121,142. Let me just confirm each of their billing amounts against their group's average.

Yes, as calculated. So the answer is these six respondents.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Find all respondents from 'HOSP_69' whose billing amount is greater than the average billing amount for all patients at that same hospital.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find all respondents from 'HOSP_69' whose billing amount is greater than the average billing amount for all patients at that same hospital. 

First, I need to identify all respondents who are in HOSP_69. Looking through the responses:

- Respondent 69: Hospital is HOSP_69.
- The other respondents (18, 71, 107, 88, 130, 1) are in different hospitals. So only Respondent 69 is in HOSP_69.

Next, calculate the average billing amount for HOSP_69. Since there's only one respondent in HOSP_69 (Respondent 69), the average is just their billing amount. Wait, that can't be right. If there's only one patient, the average is their own billing amount. But the question is asking for those whose billing is greater than the average. If there's only one, then their billing amount equals the average, so no one would be above. But maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again.

Wait, the data for Respondent 69 shows Billing Amount: 46957. Since they are the only one in HOSP_69, the average is 46957. So any billing amount greater than this would have to be higher than 46957, but since there's only one, there are none. Therefore, the answer should be none. But wait, maybe I missed other respondents in HOSP_69. Let me check all the responses again.

Looking at each respondent's Hospital field:

- Respondent 18: HOSP_18
- 71: HOSP_71
- 107: HOSP_107
- 88: HOSP_88
- 130: HOSP_130
- 69: HOSP_69
- 1: HOSP_01

No other respondents are in HOSP_69. So only Respondent 69 is there. Therefore, the average is 46957. The billing amount for Respondent 69 is exactly 46957, which is not greater than the average. Hence, there are no respondents in HOSP_69 with a billing amount above the average. The answer should be None.

<task>
Find all respondents whose billing amount is higher than the average billing amount for all patients with the same insurance provider.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find all respondents whose billing amount is higher than the average billing amount for all patients with the same insurance provider. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The questions section tells me that the Insurance Provider is an MCQ with options A. Aetna, B. Blue Cross, C. Cigna, D. Medicare, E. UnitedHealthcare. The Billing Amount is an open-ended field, so I'll use the exact numerical value provided for each respondent.

So, the plan is:

1. For each respondent, determine their insurance provider and billing amount.
2. Calculate the average billing amount for each insurance provider.
3. Compare each respondent's billing amount to the average of their respective insurance provider.
4. List all respondents where their billing amount exceeds this average.

Let's start by extracting the insurance provider and billing amount for each respondent. Let's go through each respondent one by one.

Respondent 77:
- Insurance Provider: e (UnitedHealthcare)
- Billing Amount: 39958

Respondent 149:
- Insurance Provider: d (Medicare)
- Billing Amount: 33211

Respondent 126:
- Insurance Provider: b (Blue Cross)
- Billing Amount: 33682

Respondent 39:
- Insurance Provider: a (Aetna)
- Billing Amount: 45453

Respondent 115:
- Insurance Provider: e (UnitedHealthcare)
- Billing Amount: 40693

Respondent 138:
- Insurance Provider: a (Aetna)
- Billing Amount: 7556

Respondent 124:
- Insurance Provider: c (Cigna)
- Billing Amount: 46814

Respondent 89:
- Insurance Provider: d (Medicare)
- Billing Amount: 32629

Respondent 86:
- Insurance Provider: d (Medicare)
- Billing Amount: 21784

Now, group them by insurance provider and calculate the average for each:

Aetna (a):
- Respondent 39: 45453
- Respondent 138: 7556
Total = 45453 + 7556 = 53009
Average = 53009 / 2 = 26504.5

Blue Cross (b):
- Respondent 126: 33682
Average = 33682 (only one respondent)

Cigna (c):
- Respondent 124: 46814
Average = 46814 (only one)

Medicare (d):
- Respondent 149: 33211
- Respondent 89: 32629
- Respondent 86: 21784
Total = 33211 + 32629 + 21784 = 87624
Average = 87624 / 3 = 29208

UnitedHealthcare (e):
- Respondent 77: 39958
- Respondent 115: 40693
Total = 39958 + 40693 = 80651
Average = 80651 / 2 = 40325.5

Now, compare each respondent's billing amount to their provider's average:

Aetna (average 26504.5):
- Respondent 39: 45453 > 26504.5 → Yes
- Respondent 138: 7556 < 26504.5 → No

Blue Cross (average 33682):
- Respondent 126: 33682 equals average → Not higher → No

Cigna (average 46814):
- Respondent 124: 46814 equals average → No

Medicare (average 29208):
- Respondent 149: 33211 > 29208 → Yes
- Respondent 89: 32629 > 29208 → Yes
- Respondent 86: 21784 < 29208 → No

UnitedHealthcare (average 40325.5):
- Respondent 77: 39958 < 40325.5 → No
- Respondent 115: 40693 > 40325.5 → Yes

So the respondents who meet the criteria are:

39 (Aetna), 149 (Medicare), 89 (Medicare), 115 (UnitedHealthcare).

Wait, let me double-check the Medicare group. The average is 29208. Respondent 149 has 33211, which is higher. Respondent 89 has 32629, which is also higher. Respondent 86 is below. So those two (149 and 89) are included. 

UnitedHealthcare: 115's 40693 is higher than 40325.5. 

Aetna: only 39 is above. 

So the final list is Respondents 39, 149, 89, 115.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents whose age is longer than the average for their admission type and are over the age of 41.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to list all respondents whose age is longer than the average for their admission type and are over the age of 41. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The questions section tells me that Admission Type is an MCQ with options A. Elective, B. Emergency, C. Urgent. The age is an open-ended number.

So, the plan is:

1. Calculate the average age for each admission type (Elective, Emergency, Urgent).
2. For each respondent, check if their age is greater than 41 and also greater than the average age of their specific admission type.
3. Compile the list of respondents meeting both conditions.

Let's start by going through each respondent and noting their admission type and age. Then, compute the averages.

Looking at the responses:

Respondent 117: Admission Type a (Elective), Age 58
Respondent 83: Admission Type c (Urgent), Age 24
Respondent 49: Admission Type a (Elective), Age 72
Respondent 62: Admission Type a (Elective), Age 27
Respondent 147: Admission Type b (Emergency), Age 50
Respondent 99: Admission Type b (Emergency), Age 67
Respondent 60: Admission Type b (Emergency), Age 26
Respondent 106: Admission Type a (Elective), Age 19
Respondent 12: Admission Type b (Emergency), Age 20
Respondent 82: Admission Type a (Elective), Age 82
Respondent 122: Admission Type b (Emergency), Age 73

Now, group them by admission type:

Elective (a):
- 117 (58)
- 49 (72)
- 62 (27)
- 106 (19)
- 82 (82)
Total ages: 58 +72 +27 +19 +82 = 258. Average = 258 /5 = 51.6

Emergency (b):
- 147 (50)
- 99 (67)
- 60 (26)
- 12 (20)
- 122 (73)
Total ages: 50 +67 +26 +20 +73 = 236. Average = 236 /5 = 47.2

Urgent (c):
- 83 (24)
Only one respondent. Average =24.

Now, check each respondent:

Elective group (average 51.6):
- 117: 58 >51.6 and >41 → yes
- 49:72 >51.6 and >41 → yes
- 62:27 → no (age not over 41)
- 106:19 → no
- 82:82 >51.6 and >41 → yes

Emergency group (average 47.2):
-147:50 >47.2 and >41 → yes
-99:67 >47.2 and >41 → yes
-60:26 → no
-12:20 → no
-122:73 >47.2 and >41 → yes

Urgent group (average 24):
-83:24 → age not over 41, so no

So the qualifying respondents are 117,49,82,147,99,122. Let me check their ages again to confirm:

117:58 (Elective, avg 51.6) → yes
49:72 (Elective) → yes
82:82 (Elective) → yes
147:50 (Emergency, avg47.2) → yes
99:67 (Emergency) → yes
122:73 (Emergency) → yes

So the list is 117,49,82,147,99,122. Let me check if all are over 41:

117:58>41
49:72>41
82:82>41
147:50>41
99:67>41
122:73>41

Yes. So the answer should be these respondent numbers.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose billing amount is higher than the average billing amount for all patients with the same insurance provider.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find all respondents whose billing amount is higher than the average billing amount for all patients with the same insurance provider. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The questions section tells me that the Insurance Provider is an MCQ with options A to E, each corresponding to a specific company. The Billing Amount is an open-ended field, so it's a numerical value.

So, the plan is:

1. **Group respondents by their Insurance Provider.** Each provider (Aetna, Blue Cross, etc.) will have a group of patients.
2. **Calculate the average billing amount for each group.** For each insurance provider, compute the average of all billing amounts in that group.
3. **Compare each respondent's billing amount to their group's average.** If a respondent's amount is higher than their group's average, include them in the result.

Let's start by listing all respondents and their insurance providers along with billing amounts. 

Looking at the responses:

- **Respondent 99**: Insurance Provider 'a' (Aetna), Billing 2305
- **Respondent 39**: Insurance Provider 'a' (Aetna), Billing 45453
- **Respondent 127**: Insurance Provider 'a' (Aetna), Billing 35634
- **Respondent 10**: Insurance Provider 'c' (Cigna), Billing 23762
- **Respondent 33**: Insurance Provider 'a' (Aetna), Billing 8321
- **Respondent 129**: Insurance Provider 'b' (Blue Cross), Billing 30358
- **Respondent 85**: Insurance Provider 'd' (Medicare), Billing 44940
- **Respondent 26**: Insurance Provider 'd' (Medicare), Billing 23737
- **Respondent 113**: Insurance Provider 'b' (Blue Cross), Billing 19328
- **Respondent 135**: Insurance Provider 'b' (Blue Cross), Billing 27360
- **Respondent 117**: Insurance Provider 'e' (UnitedHealthcare), Billing 20228

Now, group them by Insurance Provider:

**Aetna (a):** 
- 99: 2305
- 39: 45453
- 127: 35634
- 33: 8321

Total for Aetna: 2305 + 45453 + 35634 + 8321 = let's calculate:

2305 + 45453 = 47758
47758 + 35634 = 83392
83392 + 8321 = 91713

Average for Aetna: 91713 / 4 = 22928.25

**Blue Cross (b):**
- 129: 30358
- 113: 19328
- 135: 27360

Total: 30358 + 19328 = 49686; 49686 + 27360 = 77046

Average: 77046 / 3 = 25682

**Cigna (c):**
- 10: 23762

Only one respondent, so average is 23762.

**Medicare (d):**
- 85: 44940
- 26: 23737

Total: 44940 + 23737 = 68677

Average: 68677 / 2 = 34338.5

**UnitedHealthcare (e):**
- 117: 20228

Only one, average is 20228.

Now, compare each respondent's billing amount to their group's average:

- **Aetna Group (avg 22928.25):**
  - 99: 2305 → 2305 < 22928.25 → No
  - 39: 45453 → 45453 > 22928.25 → Yes
  - 127: 35634 → 35634 > 22928.25 → Yes
  - 33: 8321 → 8321 < 22928.25 → No

- **Blue Cross (avg 25682):**
  - 129: 30358 → 30358 > 25682 → Yes
  - 113: 19328 → 19328 < 25682 → No
  - 135: 27360 → 27360 > 25682 → Yes

- **Cigna (avg 23762):**
  - 10: 23762 → Equal, not higher → No

- **Medicare (avg 34338.5):**
  - 85: 44940 → 44940 > 34338.5 → Yes
  - 26: 23737 → 23737 < 34338.5 → No

- **UnitedHealthcare (avg 20228):**
  - 117: 20228 → Equal, not higher → No

So the respondents who meet the criteria are:

39, 127, 129, 135, 85.

Now, check the respondent numbers:

- 39: Yes
- 127: Yes
- 129: Yes
- 135: Yes
- 85: Yes

No others. Let me double-check the calculations to ensure accuracy.

For Aetna's average: 91713 /4 = 22928.25. Correct.

Blue Cross: 77046 /3 = 25682. Correct.

Medicare: 68677 /2 = 34338.5. Correct.

Yes, the respondents are 39, 127, 129, 135, 85.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Find all respondents whose billing amount is higher than the average billing amount for all patients with the same insurance provider.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find all respondents whose billing amount is higher than the average billing amount for all patients with the same insurance provider. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The questions section tells me that the Insurance Provider is an MCQ with options A. Aetna, B. Blue Cross, C. Cigna, D. Medicare, E. UnitedHealthcare. Each respondent has an Insurance Provider code (like 'e' or 'd'), and a Billing Amount which is an open-ended number.

So, the plan is:

1. For each respondent, determine their Insurance Provider and Billing Amount.
2. Calculate the average billing amount for each Insurance Provider.
3. Compare each respondent's Billing Amount to their respective Insurance Provider's average.
4. List the respondents where their Billing Amount is higher than the average.

Let's start by extracting all the respondents and their relevant data. From the responses:

- Respondent 37: Insurance Provider 'e' (UnitedHealthcare), Billing Amount 12577
- Respondent 105: Insurance Provider 'e' (UnitedHealthcare), Billing Amount 29504
- Respondent 40: Insurance Provider 'd' (Medicare), Billing Amount 17696
- Respondent 20: Insurance Provider 'd' (Medicare), Billing Amount -503
- Respondent 121: Insurance Provider 'c' (Cigna), Billing Amount 50119

Now, group them by Insurance Provider:

- UnitedHealthcare (e): 12577, 29504
- Medicare (d): 17696, -503
- Cigna (c): 50119

Next, calculate the average for each group:

For UnitedHealthcare:
Sum = 12577 + 29504 = 42081
Average = 42081 / 2 = 21040.5

For Medicare:
Sum = 17696 + (-503) = 17193
Average = 17193 / 2 = 8596.5

For Cigna:
Only one entry, 50119. Average is 50119.

Now, compare each respondent's billing amount to their group's average:

- Respondent 37: 12577 vs 21040.5 → 12577 is less, so no.
- Respondent 105: 29504 vs 21040.5 → 29504 is higher, include.
- Respondent 40: 17696 vs 8596.5 → 17696 is higher, include.
- Respondent 20: -503 vs 8596.5 → -503 is lower, no.
- Respondent 121: 50119 vs 50119 → Equal, but the task says ""higher than"", so exclude.

So the respondents meeting the criteria are 105 and 40. Their IDs are 105 and 40. The answer should be a comma-separated list of these IDs.

105, 40",
