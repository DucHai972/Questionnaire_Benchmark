<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondents have a calculated length of stay greater than 11 days and do not have a medical condition of 'Asthma'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find which respondents have a length of stay greater than 11 days and do not have a medical condition of 'Asthma'. 

First, I need to understand the data provided. The questions section tells me that the Medical Condition is an MCQ with options A. Arthritis, B. Asthma, C. Cancer, D. Diabetes, E. Hypertension, F. Obesity. So, in the responses, if a respondent's Medical Condition is 'b', that maps to Asthma.

Next, the length of stay is calculated by the difference between Discharge Date and Date of Admission. Both dates are in the format YYYY-MM-DD. I need to calculate the number of days between these two dates for each respondent and check if it's more than 11 days.

Let's go through each respondent one by one.

Starting with Respondent 142:
- Date of Admission: 2019-11-06
- Discharge Date: 2020-02-09
Calculating the days between these dates. Let's see, from November 6 to February 9. November has 30 days, so 30 - 6 = 24 days left in November. Then December has 31, January 31, and February 9. Total days: 24 + 31 + 31 + 9 = 95 days. That's way more than 11. Now check Medical Condition: 'b' which is Asthma. But the task is to exclude those with Asthma. So this respondent is out.

Respondent 75:
- Admission: 2021-02-12
- Discharge: 2021-01-26. Wait, that's a problem. The discharge date is before the admission date. That can't be right. Maybe a typo? Let me check again. The admission is 2021-02-12 and discharge is 2021-01-26. That's impossible; discharge is before admission. Maybe the dates are swapped? Or perhaps a data entry error. In that case, the length of stay would be negative, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps this is an error, but according to the data given, the length is negative, so it's less than 11 days. So this respondent doesn't qualify. Also, Medical Condition is 'f' which is Obesity. So even if the dates were correct, but since the stay is negative, it's not considered. So skip this one.

Respondent 33:
- Admission: 2022-06-24
- Discharge: 2022-07-25
Calculating days: From June 24 to July 25. June has 30 days, so 30 -24 = 6 days in June. Then 25 days in July. Total 6 +25 = 31 days. That's more than 11. Medical Condition is 'd' which is Diabetes. So this respondent meets both criteria. So include them.

Respondent 126:
- Admission: 2021-01-03
- Discharge: 2020-12-08. Again, discharge is before admission. 2020 is before 2021. So the discharge is a year earlier. That's another data inconsistency. Length would be negative. So no. Medical Condition is 'a' which is Arthritis. But since the stay is negative, doesn't qualify.

Respondent 27:
- Admission: 2021-11-21
- Discharge: 2021-11-22. That's 1 day. So length is 1 day. Less than 11. Medical Condition is 'a' (Arthritis). Doesn't meet the length requirement.

So the only respondent that meets both conditions (length >11 days and not Asthma) is Respondent 33. Let me double-check their dates again. June 24 to July 25. June has 30 days, so 6 days in June (24th to 30th inclusive is 7 days? Wait, 24th to 24th is 1 day. So from 24th to 30th is 7 days (24,25,26,27,28,29,30). Then July 1 to 25 is 25 days. Total 7 +25 = 32 days. Yes, definitely over 11. And Medical Condition is 'd' which is Diabetes. So correct.

So the answer is Respondent 33.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondents have a calculated length of stay greater than 7 days and do not have a medical condition of 'Arthritis'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find which respondents have a length of stay greater than 7 days and do not have a medical condition of 'Arthritis'. 

First, I need to understand the data provided. The questions section tells me that the Medical Condition is an MCQ with options A to F, where A is Arthritis. So, any respondent with Medical Condition 'a' has Arthritis. The Date of Admission and Discharge Date are open-ended, so I need to calculate the length of stay by finding the difference between these two dates for each respondent.

Let's go through each respondent one by one.

Starting with Respondent 147:
- Medical Condition is 'a', which maps to Arthritis. Since the task is to exclude those with Arthritis, this respondent is out. So we can skip further checks here.

Respondent 73:
- Medical Condition is 'd', which according to the schema is Diabetes. That's good because it's not Arthritis. Now, calculate the length of stay. Date of Admission is 2024-01-05 and Discharge Date is 2024-03-26. Let's compute the days between these dates. From January 5 to March 26, 2024. January has 31 days, so from Jan 5 to Jan 31 is 26 days. February 2024 is a leap year, so 29 days. March 1 to March 26 is 26 days. Total days: 26 + 29 + 26 = 81 days. That's way more than 7, so this respondent meets both criteria.

Respondent 121:
- Medical Condition is 'e', which is Hypertension. Not Arthritis. Date of Admission: 2021-10-27, Discharge: 2021-11-21. October has 31 days, so from Oct 27 to Oct 31 is 5 days. November 1 to 21 is 21 days. Total 5 +21 = 26 days. More than 7. So this respondent qualifies.

Respondent 123:
- Medical Condition is 'c', which is Cancer. Not Arthritis. Dates: Admission 2019-10-13, Discharge 2019-12-21. October 13-31: 19 days. November: 30 days. December 1-21: 21 days. Total 19+30+21=70 days. Definitely over 7. So this one is included.

Respondent 113:
- Medical Condition is 'e', Hypertension. Not Arthritis. Admission date 2021-05-14, Discharge 2021-03-20. Wait, that's a problem. The discharge date is before the admission date. That can't be right. Maybe a typo? Let me check again. The admission is 2021-05-14 and discharge is 2021-03-20. That's impossible. So this data entry is invalid. The discharge date is two months before admission. Therefore, the length of stay would be negative, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps this is an error in the data. In such cases, how should we handle it? The question asks for length of stay greater than 7 days. If the dates are invalid, maybe we should exclude this respondent. Alternatively, maybe the dates are swapped. But since we have to work with the data as given, we can't assume that. So the length of stay here would be negative, which is not greater than 7. So this respondent doesn't meet the criteria.

So the qualifying respondents are 73, 121, and 123. Let me double-check each:

- Respondent 73: Correct, 81 days, condition Diabetes.
- Respondent 121: 26 days, condition Hypertension.
- Respondent 123: 70 days, condition Cancer.
- Respondent 113: Invalid dates, excluded.

Therefore, the answer should list these three respondents.

<task>
List all respondents who are treated by the same doctor as the patient in room '272' and were admitted for the same admission type.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to list all respondents who are treated by the same doctor as the patient in room '272' and were admitted for the same admission type. 

First, I need to find out which patient is in room 272. Let me go through each respondent's data to check their room number.

Looking at the responses:

- Respondent 48: Room 263
- Respondent 14: Room 255
- Respondent 65: Room 211
- Respondent 123: Room 328
- Respondent 30: Room 272 → Found the patient in room 272. 

Now, I need to note the doctor and admission type for this patient. 

Respondent 30's doctor is DOC_30, and the admission type is 'b'. According to the questions, admission type options are A. Elective, B. Emergency, C. Urgent. So 'b' maps to Emergency. 

Next, I have to find all other respondents who have the same doctor (DOC_30) and the same admission type (Emergency). 

Let's check each respondent:

- Respondent 48: Doctor DOC_48, Admission Type a (Elective) → Doesn't match.
- Respondent 14: DOC_14, Admission Type a (Elective) → No.
- Respondent 65: DOC_65, a → No.
- Respondent 123: DOC_123, c (Urgent) → No.
- Respondent 30: Already the source, so maybe included? The task says ""all respondents"" so maybe yes, but need to check others.
- Respondent 17: DOC_17, a → No.
- Respondent 103: DOC_103, b (Emergency) → Same admission type but different doctor.
- Respondent 126: DOC_126, b (Emergency) → Same admission type, different doctor.
- Respondent 19: DOC_19, b (Emergency) → Same admission type, different doctor.
- Respondent 148: DOC_148, c (Urgent) → No.

So, the only respondent with doctor DOC_30 and admission type Emergency is Respondent 30 themselves. Are there any others? Let me double-check. 

Looking again through all respondents, no other entries have DOC_30 as the doctor. Therefore, the only respondent meeting both conditions is Respondent 30.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondents have a calculated length of stay greater than 14 days and do not have a medical condition of 'Asthma'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find which respondents have a length of stay greater than 14 days and do not have a medical condition of 'Asthma'. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The questions section tells me that the medical condition is a multiple-choice question (MCQ) with options like Arthritis, Asthma, Cancer, Diabetes, Hypertension, Obesity. The responses use codes (a, b, c, etc.), so I need to map those to the actual conditions.

Next, the length of stay (LOS) isn't a direct field. I have to calculate it using the Date of Admission and Discharge Date. The LOS is the number of days between these two dates. If the discharge date is before the admission date, that might be an error, but I'll proceed with the calculation as given.

Let's go through each respondent:

**Respondent 143:**
- Admission: 2022-12-10
- Discharge: 2022-09-27
Wait, discharge is before admission. That's impossible. Maybe a typo? Let's check the original data. Oh, in the example, the answer was ""None"" for a different query, but here, maybe this date is a mistake. But regardless, calculating LOS: 2022-09-27 minus 2022-12-10 would be negative. So LOS is negative, which can't be right. Maybe the dates are swapped? But I have to take them as given. So LOS here is negative, so not greater than 14. So skip.

**Respondent 107:**
- Admission: 2024-01-31
- Discharge: 2024-02-02
LOS: 2 days (from Jan 31 to Feb 2 is 2 days). Not greater than 14. So no.

**Respondent 58:**
- Admission: 2020-05-22
- Discharge: 2020-06-08
Calculating the days between May 22 and June 8. May has 31 days, so from May 22 to May 31 is 9 days (including start day?), then June 1 to 8 is 8 days. Total 17 days. So LOS is 17. That's greater than 14. Medical condition is 'd', which maps to Diabetes. So not Asthma. So this respondent qualifies.

**Respondent 134:**
- Admission: 2021-12-01
- Discharge: 2022-01-15
From Dec 1, 2021 to Jan 15, 2022. December has 31 days, so 31 - 1 (since Dec 1 is start) = 30 days in Dec, plus 15 days in Jan. Total 45 days. LOS 45. Greater than 14. Medical condition is 'f' which is Obesity. Not Asthma. So this one qualifies.

**Respondent 98:**
- Admission: 2021-04-17
- Discharge: 2021-03-11
Again, discharge before admission. Negative LOS. So invalid, skip. Also, medical condition is 'b' which is Asthma. But since LOS is invalid, even if the condition wasn't Asthma, it wouldn't matter. But here, the condition is Asthma, so even if LOS was valid, it would be excluded.

**Respondent 116:**
- Admission: 2020-06-23
- Discharge: 2020-06-22
Again, discharge is before admission. LOS negative. So invalid. Medical condition 'f' (Obesity), but LOS not >14. So no.

So the qualifying respondents are 58 and 134. Let me double-check their LOS:

For Respondent 58: May 22 to June 8. Let's count days. May 22 is day 1. May 23 (2), ..., May 31 is 10 days. Then June 1 to June 8 is 8 days. Total 18 days? Wait, wait. Wait, from May 22 to May 31 inclusive is 10 days (31-22+1=10). Then June 1 to June 8 is 8 days. Total 18 days. So LOS is 18-1=17? Wait, depends on whether the discharge day is counted as a full day. If admission is on day 0, discharge on day n, then LOS is n days. For example, admitted on day 1, discharged same day: LOS 0? Or 1? Hmm. Let me use a date difference calculator. From 2020-05-22 to 2020-06-08: the number of days is (June 8 - May 22) = 17 days. Because May has 31 days: 31 -22 =9 days remaining in May, plus 8 in June: 9+8=17. So LOS is 17 days. Correct.

Respondent 134: 2021-12-01 to 2022-01-15. December has 31 days. From Dec 1 to Dec 31 is 31 days. Then Jan 1 to Jan 15 is 15 days. Total 31 +15 =46 days. But wait, from Dec 1 to Jan 15 inclusive? Let's calculate: (2022-01-15 - 2021-12-01) = 45 days. So LOS is 45 days. Definitely over 14.

So both 58 and 134 meet the criteria. Their medical conditions are Diabetes and Obesity, neither is Asthma. So the answer should be Respondent 58 and 134.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondents have a calculated length of stay greater than 18 days and do not have a medical condition of 'Diabetes'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find which respondents have a length of stay greater than 18 days and do not have a medical condition of 'Diabetes'. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The questions section tells me that 'Medical Condition' is an MCQ with options A to F, where D is Diabetes. So, any respondent with Medical Condition 'D' should be excluded.

Next, the length of stay (LOS) is calculated by the difference between Discharge Date and Date of Admission. Both dates are in the format YYYY-MM-DD. I'll need to parse these dates for each respondent, calculate the days between them, and check if it's more than 18.

Let's go through each respondent one by one:

**Respondent 77:**
- Date of Admission: 2024-04-05
- Discharge Date: 2024-02-10
Wait, the discharge date is before the admission date here. That doesn't make sense. Maybe a typo? Let me check again. The admission is April 5, 2024, discharge February 10, 2024. That's impossible. Maybe the dates are swapped? Or perhaps a mistake in data entry. Since the discharge is before admission, the LOS would be negative, which isn't possible. So maybe this is an error, but according to the data, LOS would be negative, so it's not greater than 18. So we can skip this one.

**Respondent 110:**
- Admission: 2019-12-12
- Discharge: 2019-08-21
Again, discharge is before admission. Another data error. LOS negative. So no.

**Respondent 79:**
- Admission: 2021-01-07
- Discharge: 2020-12-18
Again, discharge before admission. Negative LOS. Not valid. Skip.

**Respondent 146:**
- Admission: 2021-03-04
- Discharge: 2021-02-06
Discharge before admission. Negative. Skip.

**Respondent 16:**
- Admission: 2020-01-24
- Discharge: 2019-12-13
Again, discharge before admission. Negative. Skip.

**Respondent 26:**
- Admission: 2020-05-04
- Discharge: 2020-07-14
Here, discharge is after admission. Let's calculate the days. From May 4 to July 14. May has 31 days, so May 4 to May 31 is 27 days. June has 30 days, so 27 + 30 = 57. Then July 14 is 14 days. Total 27 + 30 +14 = 71 days. Wait, but May 4 to July 14 is actually 71 days. So LOS is 71 days. That's way more than 18. Now check medical condition. Medical Condition is D (Diabetes). So this respondent has Diabetes, so they should be excluded.

**Respondent 54:**
- Admission: 2023-12-23
- Discharge: 2024-02-07
Calculate LOS. From 2023-12-23 to 2024-02-07. December has 31 days, so from 23rd to 31st is 8 days. January has 31 days. February 7 days. Total 8 +31 +7 = 46 days. LOS 46. Medical Condition is D (Diabetes). Exclude.

**Respondent 55:**
- Admission: 2024-03-17
- Discharge: 2024-04-22
March 17 to April 22. March has 31 days, so 31-17=14 days in March, plus 22 in April. Total 14+22=36 days. LOS 36. Medical Condition is E (Hypertension). Not Diabetes. So this one meets both conditions.

**Respondent 68:**
- Admission: 2022-08-22
- Discharge: 2022-09-18
August 22 to September 18. August has 31 days, so 31-22=9 days in August, plus 18 in September. Total 9+18=27 days. LOS 27. Medical Condition is C (Cancer). Not Diabetes. So this one qualifies.

**Respondent 21:**
- Admission: 2021-11-13
- Discharge: 2021-08-19
Discharge before admission. Negative. Skip.

**Respondent 41:**
- Admission: 2021-09-10
- Discharge: 2021-09-18
That's 8 days (from 10th to 18th inclusive is 9 days? Wait, 18-10=8 days, but including both dates is 9 days. Wait, need to calculate exact days. From Sept 10 to Sept 18: 18-10 = 8 days, but since both days are counted, it's 8 days. So LOS is 8. Less than 18. Doesn't qualify.

**Respondent 62:**
- Admission: 2024-02-22
- Discharge: 2024-02-04
Discharge before admission. Negative. Skip.

So after checking all, the respondents that meet the criteria are:

- Respondent 55: LOS 36 days, Medical Condition E (Hypertension)
- Respondent 68: LOS 27 days, Medical Condition C (Cancer)

Wait, but let me double-check the Medical Conditions. The Medical Condition options are:

A. Arthritis B. Asthma C. Cancer D. Diabetes E. Hypertension F. Obesity

So Respondent 55's Medical Condition is E, which is Hypertension (not Diabetes), so included. Respondent 68's is C, Cancer, also not Diabetes. Both qualify.

So the answer should be Respondents 55 and 68.

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents who are treated by the same doctor as the patient in room '245' and were admitted for the same admission type.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The question is asking to list all respondents who are treated by the same doctor as the patient in room '245' and were admitted for the same admission type. 

First, I need to find out which patient is in room 245. Looking at the responses, I'll check each respondent's room number. 

Starting with Respondent 43: Room Number is 468. Not 245.
Respondent 79: Room 300. Nope.
Respondent 146: Room 245. There we go. So the patient in room 245 is Respondent 146. 

Now, I need to note the doctor and admission type for Respondent 146. The Doctor is DOC_146, and the Admission Type is 'b'. But wait, the Admission Type is an MCQ. The question for Admission Type is MCQ: A. Elective B. Emergency C. Urgent. So 'b' maps to Emergency. 

So, the criteria are: find all respondents where Doctor is DOC_146 and Admission Type is Emergency (which is 'b' in the data). 

Now, let's go through each respondent again:

Respondent 43: Doctor is DOC_43, Admission Type 'a' (Elective). Doesn't match.
Respondent 79: Doctor DOC_79, Admission Type 'c' (Urgent). No match.
Respondent 146: Doctor DOC_146, Admission Type 'b' (Emergency). This is the original patient, but the task says ""list all respondents"" including this one? The question says ""treated by the same doctor as the patient in room 245"", so if the patient in room 245 is included, then yes. But need to check others.

Respondent 74: Doctor DOC_74, Admission Type 'b' (Emergency). Doctor doesn't match DOC_146.
Respondent 113: Doctor DOC_113, Admission Type 'a' (Elective). Doesn't match.

Wait, are there any other respondents in the data? The given responses are for 43,79,146,74,113. So only these five. 

So the only respondent that matches both Doctor DOC_146 and Admission Type Emergency (b) is Respondent 146 themselves. Are there any others? Let me check again. 

No, others have different doctors. So the answer would be just Respondent 146. But wait, the task says ""list all respondents"" who meet both conditions. So if there's only one, then that's the answer. 

But wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check. The patient in room 245 is Respondent 146. Their doctor is DOC_146. So we need to find all respondents with Doctor = DOC_146 and Admission Type = 'b' (Emergency). 

Looking at all respondents again:

- Respondent 146: Doctor DOC_146, Admission Type 'b' → matches.
- Any others? The other respondents have different doctors. So no. 

Therefore, the answer is Respondent 146. But the output format requires a comma-separated list of respondent numbers. So the answer is ""146"".

</output>

<task>
List all respondents who are treated by the same doctor as the patient in room '300' and were admitted for the same admission type.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The question is asking to list all respondents who are treated by the same doctor as the patient in room '300' and were admitted for the same admission type. 

First, I need to find out which patient is in room 300. Looking through the responses:

Respondent 104 has Room Number: 300. So that's the starting point. Now, I need to note the doctor and admission type for this respondent.

For Respondent 104:
- Doctor: DOC_104
- Admission Type: a (from the MCQ, Admission Type options are A. Elective, B. Emergency, C. Urgent). So 'a' maps to Elective.

Now, the task is to find all other respondents who have the same doctor (DOC_104) and the same admission type (Elective). 

Looking at each respondent:

- Respondent 120: Doctor DOC_120, Admission Type c (Urgent). Doesn't match.
- Respondent 78: Doctor DOC_78, Admission Type c (Urgent). Doesn't match.
- Respondent 104: This is the one in room 300. We need others, so skip.
- Respondent 70: Doctor DOC_70, Admission Type a (Elective). Doctor doesn't match DOC_104.
- Respondent 129: Doctor DOC_129, Admission Type a (Elective). Doctor doesn't match.
- Respondent 139: Doctor DOC_139, Admission Type c (Urgent). Doesn't match.

Wait, none of the other respondents have Doctor DOC_104. So the only one is Respondent 104 themselves. But the task says ""all respondents"" which might include the original if there are others. But in this case, there are no others. So the answer would be just Respondent 104? But the question says ""list all respondents who are treated by the same doctor as the patient in room 300"", which is DOC_104, and same admission type (Elective). So only Respondent 104 meets both conditions. But maybe the task wants to exclude the original patient? The wording isn't clear. However, the example given in the initial data had an answer of ""None"" when no respondents matched. Here, if only the original patient matches, but the task is to list others, then the answer would be none. Wait, but the task doesn't specify excluding the original. Let me check the exact wording again: ""list all respondents who are treated by the same doctor as the patient in room '300' and were admitted for the same admission type."" So it includes any respondent, including the one in room 300. But in the data, only Respondent 104 is in room 300 and has those attributes. Are there any others with the same doctor and admission type? Let me check again.

Looking at all respondents:

- Respondent 104: Doctor DOC_104, Admission Type a (Elective)
- Others: All other respondents have different doctors. So no one else has DOC_104 as their doctor. Therefore, the only respondent that meets both conditions is Respondent 104. But the task is to list all respondents, which would include 104. However, the example given in the initial data had a similar structure where the answer was ""None"" when no matches. But in this case, there is one match. Wait, but the example was looking for DOC_107 and HOSP_148, which didn't exist. Here, the patient in room 300 is Respondent 104, and the doctor is DOC_104. Are there any other respondents with DOC_104? Let me check again. All other respondents have different doctor IDs: DOC_120, DOC_78, DOC_70, DOC_129, DOC_139. So no, only Respondent 104 has DOC_104. Therefore, the answer is only Respondent 104. But the task says ""list all respondents"", so the answer would be ""104"". However, the example's answer was ""None"" when there were no matches. So in this case, since there is one match, the answer should be ""104"".

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents who are treated by the same doctor as the patient in room '268' and were admitted for the same admission type.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The question is asking to list all respondents who are treated by the same doctor as the patient in room '268' and were admitted for the same admission type. 

First, I need to find out which patient is in room 268. Let me go through the responses.

Looking at the responses, Respondent 113 has Room Number: 268. So that's the patient we need to start with. Now, I need to note their doctor and admission type. 

For Respondent 113:
- Doctor: DOC_113
- Admission Type: a (since the Admission Type question is MCQ with options A. Elective, B. Emergency, C. Urgent). So 'a' maps to Elective.

Now, the task is to find all other respondents who have the same doctor (DOC_113) and the same admission type (Elective, which is 'a' in the data). 

Let me go through each respondent to check these two fields.

Respondent 113: Already the starting point. Doctor DOC_113, Admission Type a. But we need others, so maybe include or exclude? The task says ""treated by the same doctor as the patient in room 268"", so including the patient themselves might depend on interpretation, but the example given in the initial problem had an answer of ""None"" when no one matched, so perhaps we need to list all including or excluding? Let's check.

Looking at other respondents:

Respondent 21: Doctor DOC_21, Admission Type b. Doesn't match.

Respondent 11: Doctor DOC_11, Admission Type b. No.

Respondent 111: Doctor DOC_111, Admission Type b. No.

Respondent 83: Doctor DOC_83, Admission Type c. No.

Respondent 65: Doctor DOC_65, Admission Type a. Doctor doesn't match.

Respondent 7: Doctor DOC_07, Admission Type b. No.

Respondent 24: Doctor DOC_24, Admission Type b. No.

Respondent 59: Doctor DOC_59, Admission Type c. No.

Respondent 148: Doctor DOC_148, Admission Type c. No.

Respondent 6: Doctor DOC_06, Admission Type a. Doctor doesn't match.

Respondent 69: Doctor DOC_69, Admission Type b. No.

So, the only respondent with Doctor DOC_113 and Admission Type a is Respondent 113 themselves. But the task says ""list all respondents"" who meet the criteria. If the question includes the original patient, then 113 would be the answer. If not, then there are none. However, in the example given, when the query was for doctor DOC_107 and hospital HOSP_148, the answer was ""None"" even though there was a respondent 148 with HOSP_148 but different doctor. So perhaps the task is to list others, not including the original. Wait, but in the example, the answer was ""None"" because no one had both doctor DOC_107 and HOSP_148. 

In this case, the original patient (113) is in room 268, has doctor DOC_113 and admission type a. Are there any other respondents with DOC_113 and a? From the data provided, no. So the answer would be only Respondent 113. But the task says ""list all respondents"", which could include the original. However, sometimes such questions might be looking for others, but the example answer included ""None"" when there were no matches. Let me check the data again to confirm.

Looking again through all respondents, no one else has Doctor DOC_113. So the only one is Respondent 113. But the task is to list all respondents who are treated by the same doctor as the patient in room 268 (which is DOC_113) and same admission type (Elective/a). So Respondent 113 is the only one. However, sometimes such questions might exclude the original patient, but the example didn't have that scenario. The example's answer was ""None"" because there were no matches. Here, if the original is included, the answer would be 113. If not, then none. But the task doesn't specify to exclude the original. So I think the answer is Respondent 113.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondents have a calculated length of stay greater than 6 days and do not have a medical condition of 'Cancer'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find which respondents have a length of stay greater than 6 days and do not have a medical condition of 'Cancer'. 

First, I need to understand how to calculate the length of stay. The data provided includes 'Date of Admission' and 'Discharge Date' for each respondent. The length of stay would be the number of days between these two dates. 

But wait, the dates are in different formats. Let me check the responses. For example, Respondent 45 has Date of Admission as 2022-10-12 and Discharge Date as 2022-09-25. Wait, that's strange. The discharge date is before the admission date? That can't be right. Maybe it's a typo. Let me check other respondents. 

Looking at Respondent 121: Admission 2021-10-27, Discharge 2021-11-21. That's a positive duration. Respondent 133: Admission 2023-10-15, Discharge 2024-01-02. That's a longer stay. Respondent 114: Admission 2024-01-04, Discharge 2023-11-08. Again, discharge is before admission. That's impossible. Maybe the dates are swapped, or there's a data entry error. Hmm. Similarly, Respondent 72: Admission 2020-05-15, Discharge 2020-06-14. That's a positive duration.

So, for Respondents 45 and 114, the discharge date is before the admission date. That might be a mistake. But since the data is given as is, I have to work with it. Let's calculate the length of stay as (Discharge Date - Admission Date). If the discharge date is earlier, the result would be negative, which would mean the length of stay is negative days, which isn't possible. So perhaps those entries are errors, but according to the problem, we have to use the data as provided. 

But the question is about length of stay greater than 6 days. So even if the dates are swapped, the absolute difference might be considered, but the problem states ""calculated length of stay"", which is (Discharge Date - Admission Date). If the discharge is before admission, the result is negative, which can't be greater than 6. So those respondents would not meet the criteria. 

So, let's process each respondent:

Starting with Respondent 45:
Admission: 2022-10-12
Discharge: 2022-09-25
Calculating the difference: September 25 is before October 12, so the days would be negative. So length of stay is negative, which is less than 6. So they don't qualify.

Respondent 121:
Admission: 2021-10-27
Discharge: 2021-11-21
Days between: From 10/27 to 11/21. Let's calculate. October has 31 days, so 27 to 31 is 4 days in October, plus 21 days in November: total 25 days. So 25 days. That's greater than 6. Now check medical condition. Medical Condition is 'e' which maps to 'Hypertension' (from the questions, Medical Condition options: A. Arthritis B. Asthma C. Cancer D. Diabetes E. Hypertension F. Obesity). So 'e' is Hypertension, not Cancer. So this respondent meets both conditions.

Respondent 133:
Admission: 2023-10-15
Discharge: 2024-01-02
Calculating the days. From 2023-10-15 to 2024-01-02. Let's compute. From October 15 to October 31: 16 days. November has 30, December 31, plus 2 days in January: 16+30+31+2 = 79 days. So 79 days, which is way more than 6. Medical condition is 'c' which is Cancer. So since the condition is Cancer, this respondent is excluded. So they don't meet the criteria.

Respondent 114:
Admission: 2024-01-04
Discharge: 2023-11-08. Again, discharge before admission. Negative days. So length of stay is negative, which is not greater than 6. So no.

Respondent 72:
Admission: 2020-05-15
Discharge: 2020-06-14. Days between: May has 31 days, so from 15th to 31st is 16 days, plus 14 days in June: 16+14=30 days. So 30 days, which is more than 6. Medical condition is 'e' (Hypertension), so not Cancer. So this respondent meets the criteria.

Wait, but let me check the medical condition for each again. For Respondent 72, Medical Condition is 'e', which is Hypertension. Correct. So they qualify.

So the respondents that meet the criteria are 121 and 72. Let me double-check:

Respondent 121: LOS 25 days, condition Hypertension. Yes.

Respondent 72: LOS 30 days, condition Hypertension. Yes.

Others either have LOS <=6 (or negative) or have Cancer (like 133). So the answer should be Respondents 121 and 72.
