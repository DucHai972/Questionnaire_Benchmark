<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondents have a calculated length of stay greater than 11 days and do not have a medical condition of 'Asthma'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find which respondents have a length of stay greater than 11 days and do not have a medical condition of 'Asthma'. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The 'questions' section tells me that 'Medical Condition' is an MCQ with options including Asthma (option B). The 'Date of Admission' and 'Discharge Date' are open-ended fields, so their values are dates in the format YYYY-MM-DD. 

For each respondent in the 'responses' array, I need to calculate the length of stay by finding the difference between the discharge date and admission date. Then, check if that difference is greater than 11 days. Also, check if their medical condition is not 'Asthma'. 

Let's go through each respondent one by one.

1. **Respondent 142**:
   - Admission Date: 2019-11-06
   - Discharge Date: 2020-02-09
   - Calculating the days between these dates. Let's see: November has 30 days, so from 6th to 30th is 24 days (including the 6th). December has 31, January 31, February 9. Total: 24 + 31 + 31 + 9 = 95 days. That's way over 11.
   - Medical Condition: The answer is 'B', which maps to 'Asthma' according to the schema. But the task requires respondents who do NOT have Asthma. So this one is excluded.

2. **Respondent 75**:
   - Admission: 2021-02-12
   - Discharge: 2021-01-26. Wait, that's a problem. The discharge date is before the admission date. That can't be right. Maybe a typo? Let me check again. The admission is 2021-02-12 and discharge 2021-01-26. That's impossible; discharge is earlier. Maybe the dates are swapped, but as per the data, the length would be negative. So perhaps this is an error, but according to the data, the length is negative, which can't be greater than 11. So this respondent doesn't meet the criteria. Also, their medical condition is 'F' which maps to 'Obesity'. So even if the dates were correct, but since the length is negative, it's invalid. So skip.

3. **Respondent 33**:
   - Admission: 2022-06-24
   - Discharge: 2022-07-25
   - Calculate days: June has 30 days, so from 24th to 30th is 7 days (24-30 inclusive is 7 days). Then July 1-25 is 25 days. Total 7 +25 =32 days. That's over 11.
   - Medical Condition: 'D' which is 'Diabetes'. So not Asthma. So this respondent qualifies.

4. **Respondent 126**:
   - Admission: 2021-01-03
   - Discharge: 2020-12-08. Again, discharge before admission. Same issue as respondent 75. The dates are in 2021 and 2020. So discharge is a year before admission. Negative days. So length is negative, which doesn't meet the >11 days. Medical condition is 'A' (Arthritis). But since the length is invalid, this respondent is excluded.

5. **Respondent 27**:
   - Admission: 2021-11-21
   - Discharge: 2021-11-22. That's 1 day. So length is 1 day, which is not greater than 11. Medical condition is 'A' (Arthritis). Doesn't meet the length requirement.

So the only respondent that meets both conditions (length >11 days and medical condition not Asthma) is respondent 33.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondents have a calculated length of stay greater than 7 days and do not have a medical condition of 'Arthritis'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find which respondents have a length of stay greater than 7 days and do not have a medical condition of 'Arthritis'. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The responses array has each respondent with their answers. Each answer includes a Date of Admission and Discharge Date, which are open-ended fields. The Medical Condition is an MCQ, so I need to map the answer codes to their corresponding values.

For each respondent, I need to calculate the length of stay by finding the difference between the discharge date and admission date. Then check if that difference is more than 7 days. Also, check if their medical condition is not 'Arthritis'.

Starting with the first respondent, respondent 147. Their admission date is 2021-05-06 and discharge is 2021-06-06. Let's calculate the days between these dates. May has 31 days, so from May 6 to June 6 is 31 days (May 6 to May 31 is 25 days, plus 6 days in June = 31 days). So 31 days, which is greater than 7. Their medical condition is 'A', which according to the schema maps to Arthritis. So this one doesn't qualify because they have Arthritis. Exclude.

Next, respondent 73. Admission 2024-01-05, discharge 2024-03-26. Let's calculate the days. January has 31 days, so from Jan 5 to Jan 31 is 26 days. February 2024 is a leap year, so 29 days. March 1 to March 26 is 26 days. Total: 26 + 29 + 26 = 81 days. That's way over 7. Medical condition is 'D', which maps to Diabetes. So this meets both conditions. Include.

Respondent 121: Admission 2021-10-27, discharge 2021-11-21. October has 31 days, so 27th to 31st is 4 days. November 21 days. Total 25 days. Greater than 7. Medical condition is 'E' which is Hypertension. So include.

Respondent 123: Admission 2019-10-13, discharge 2019-12-21. Let's calculate. From Oct 13 to Oct 31: 18 days. November has 30 days. December 1 to 21: 21 days. Total 18+30+21=69 days. Medical condition 'C' is Cancer. So include.

Respondent 113: Admission 2021-05-14, discharge 2021-03-20. Wait, the discharge date is before the admission date? That can't be right. Maybe a typo. If admission is May 14, 2021, and discharge March 20, 2021, that's negative days. That's impossible. Perhaps the dates are swapped. Maybe discharge is 2021-05-20? But the data says 2021-03-20. Hmm. If the dates are correct as given, the length of stay would be negative, which doesn't make sense. So maybe this is an error in the data. But according to the given data, the discharge date is before admission, so the length would be negative. Since that's not possible, perhaps we should treat this as 0 days or invalid. But the problem states to calculate the length of stay. If we proceed with the dates as given, the length is negative, so not greater than 7. So this respondent doesn't qualify. Also, their medical condition is 'E' (Hypertension), so even if the dates were correct, but since the length is negative, they don't meet the criteria.

So the qualifying respondents are 73, 121, 123. Let me check their medical conditions again. 73: D is Diabetes. 121: E is Hypertension. 123: C is Cancer. None of these are Arthritis, so they all meet the second condition. Their lengths of stay are 81, 25, 69 days respectively, all over 7. So the answer should be respondents 73, 121, 123.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
List all respondents who are treated by the same doctor as the patient in room '272' and were admitted for the same admission type.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to list all respondents who are treated by the same doctor as the patient in room '272' and were admitted for the same admission type. 

First, I need to find out which patient is in room 272. Looking through the responses, I'll check each respondent's ""Room Number"" answer. 

Scanning the responses:
- Respondent 48: Room 263
- Respondent 14: Room 255
- Respondent 65: Room 211
- Respondent 123: Room 328
- Respondent 30: Room 272. Here we go. So the patient in room 272 is respondent 30.

Now, I need to find out the doctor and admission type for respondent 30. 
- Doctor: DOC_30
- Admission Type: The answer is ""B"". Looking at the questions, ""Admission Type"" is an MCQ with options A. Elective, B. Emergency, C. Urgent. So ""B"" maps to Emergency.

Next, I need to find all other respondents who have the same doctor (DOC_30) and the same admission type (Emergency). 

Looking through each respondent:
- Respondent 48: Doctor DOC_48, Admission Type A (Elective) → Doesn't match.
- Respondent 14: DOC_14, Admission Type A → No.
- Respondent 65: DOC_65, A → No.
- Respondent 123: DOC_123, C → No.
- Respondent 30: Already the source, so maybe include or not? The task says ""other respondents"", but the wording isn't clear. Let's check the original task again. It says ""list all respondents"", which might include the original if needed. But let's see if others match.
- Respondent 17: DOC_17, A → No.
- Respondent 103: DOC_103, B (Emergency). Doctor is different, so no.
- Respondent 126: DOC_126, B (Emergency). Doctor different.
- Respondent 19: DOC_19, B (Emergency). Doctor different.
- Respondent 148: DOC_148, C → No.

Wait, so the only one with Doctor DOC_30 is respondent 30. And their admission type is Emergency (B). Are there any other respondents with Doctor DOC_30 and admission type B? From the data, no. So the only respondent that meets both conditions is respondent 30. But the task says ""list all respondents"", which might include the original patient. However, sometimes such questions exclude the original, but the problem statement doesn't specify. Let me check the example given. In the example, the answer was ""None"" when looking for DOC_107 and HOSP_148, which weren't present. So in this case, if the original is the only one, then the answer would be 30. But need to confirm if the task includes the original. The task says ""treated by the same doctor as the patient in room 272"", which includes the patient themselves if they meet the criteria. So respondent 30 is included. But are there others with the same doctor and admission type? From the data, no. So the answer is just 30.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondents have a calculated length of stay greater than 14 days and do not have a medical condition of 'Asthma'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find which respondents have a length of stay greater than 14 days and do not have a medical condition of 'Asthma'. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The responses array contains each respondent's answers. Each answer includes a ""Medical Condition"" and dates for admission and discharge. The ""Medical Condition"" is an MCQ where option B is Asthma. So, I need to check if the respondent's answer for Medical Condition is not B.

Next, calculate the length of stay (LOS) for each respondent. LOS is the number of days between the discharge date and admission date. The dates are in YYYY-MM-DD format. I'll need to parse these dates, compute the difference, and check if it's more than 14 days.

Looking at each respondent:

1. Respondent 143:
   - Admission: 2022-12-10
   - Discharge: 2022-09-27
   Wait, discharge is before admission? That can't be right. Maybe a typo. Let me check the dates again. If admission is 2022-12-10 and discharge 2022-09-27, that's negative days. That's impossible. Maybe the dates are swapped? Or a data entry error. In this case, the LOS would be negative, so it's less than 14 days. So this respondent doesn't qualify.

2. Respondent 107:
   - Admission: 2024-01-31
   - Discharge: 2024-02-02
   LOS is 2 days (from Jan 31 to Feb 2). So less than 14. Doesn't qualify.

3. Respondent 58:
   - Admission: 2020-05-22
   - Discharge: 2020-06-08
   Let's calculate: May has 31 days. From May 22 to May 31 is 9 days. Then June 1 to June 8 is 8 days. Total 17 days. So LOS is 17, which is greater than 14. Medical Condition is D (Diabetes, since the options are A. Arthritis, B. Asthma, etc.). So not Asthma. So this respondent qualifies.

4. Respondent 134:
   - Admission: 2021-12-01
   - Discharge: 2022-01-15
   December has 31 days. From Dec 1 to Dec 31: 30 days. Then Jan 1 to Jan 15: 15 days. Total 45 days. LOS 45. Medical Condition F (Obesity). Not Asthma. Qualifies.

5. Respondent 98:
   - Admission: 2021-04-17
   - Discharge: 2021-03-11
   Again, discharge before admission. Negative days. So LOS is negative. Doesn't qualify.

6. Respondent 116:
   - Admission: 2020-06-23
   - Discharge: 2020-06-22
   Discharge is a day before admission. Negative LOS. Doesn't qualify.

So the qualifying respondents are 58 and 134. Let me double-check their Medical Conditions. Respondent 58 has Medical Condition D (Diabetes), and 134 has F (Obesity). Neither is B (Asthma). Their LOS is 17 and 45 days, both over 14. So the answer should be respondents 58 and 134.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondents have a calculated length of stay greater than 18 days and do not have a medical condition of 'Diabetes'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find respondents who have a length of stay greater than 18 days and do not have a medical condition of 'Diabetes'. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The 'questions' section tells me that 'Medical Condition' is an MCQ with options including Diabetes (option D). The 'Date of Admission' and 'Discharge Date' are open-ended fields, so I'll need to calculate the length of stay by finding the difference between these two dates for each respondent.

Starting with each respondent in the 'responses' array, I'll check two things: 
1. Their medical condition is not 'Diabetes' (i.e., the answer to 'Medical Condition' is not 'D').
2. The length of stay (Discharge Date minus Admission Date) is more than 18 days.

Let's go through each respondent one by one.

Respondent 77:
- Medical Condition: B (which maps to Asthma, not Diabetes)
- Admission Date: 2024-04-05
- Discharge Date: 2024-02-10
Wait, the discharge date is before the admission date here. That doesn't make sense. Maybe a typo? If the discharge is earlier, the length of stay would be negative. Perhaps the dates are swapped. But since the data is as given, I'll calculate it as is. The difference between 2024-04-05 and 2024-02-10 is negative, so length of stay is negative. So this doesn't meet the >18 days criteria. So exclude.

Respondent 110:
- Medical Condition: F (Obesity)
- Admission: 2019-12-12
- Discharge: 2019-08-21
Again, discharge is before admission. The dates are in 2019, so admission is December and discharge August? That's impossible. Maybe the year is a typo. But assuming the data is correct, the stay is negative. So no.

Respondent 79:
- Medical Condition: B (Asthma)
- Admission: 2021-01-07
- Discharge: 2020-12-18
Again, discharge before admission. Negative days. Exclude.

Respondent 146:
- Medical Condition: D (Diabetes). So this is excluded because we need non-Diabetes.

Respondent 16:
- Medical Condition: E (Hypertension)
- Admission: 2020-01-24
- Discharge: 2019-12-13
Again, discharge before admission. Negative days. Exclude.

Respondent 26:
- Medical Condition: D (Diabetes). Excluded.

Respondent 54:
- Medical Condition: D (Diabetes). Excluded.

Respondent 55:
- Medical Condition: E (Hypertension)
- Admission: 2024-03-17
- Discharge: 2024-04-22
Calculate the days between these dates. March 17 to April 22. March has 31 days, so from March 17 to March 31 is 14 days. April 1 to April 22 is 22 days. Total 14 + 22 = 36 days. That's more than 18. So this respondent qualifies.

Respondent 68:
- Medical Condition: C (Cancer)
- Admission: 2022-08-22
- Discharge: 2022-09-18
August 22 to September 18. August has 31 days, so 31 - 22 = 9 days in August, plus 18 in September: 9 + 18 = 27 days. More than 18. So this qualifies.

Respondent 21:
- Medical Condition: A (Arthritis)
- Admission: 2021-11-13
- Discharge: 2021-08-19
Discharge is before admission. Negative days. Exclude.

Respondent 41:
- Medical Condition: F (Obesity)
- Admission: 2021-09-10
- Discharge: 2021-09-18
That's 8 days. Less than 18. Exclude.

Respondent 62:
- Medical Condition: C (Cancer)
- Admission: 2024-02-22
- Discharge: 2024-02-04
Discharge before admission. Negative days. Exclude.

So the qualifying respondents are 55 and 68. Let me double-check their dates.

Respondent 55: Admission 2024-03-17, Discharge 2024-04-22. The difference is 36 days. Correct.

Respondent 68: Admission 2022-08-22, Discharge 2022-09-18. From August 22 to September 18. August has 31 days, so 31-22=9 days in August, plus 18 in September: 27 days. Correct.

No other respondents meet both conditions. So the answer should be respondents 55 and 68.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
List all respondents who are treated by the same doctor as the patient in room '245' and were admitted for the same admission type.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to list all respondents who are treated by the same doctor as the patient in room '245' and were admitted for the same admission type. 

First, I need to find out which patient is in room 245. Looking at the responses, each respondent has a ""Room Number"" in their answers. Let me check each one:

- Respondent 43: Room 468
- Respondent 79: Room 300
- Respondent 146: Room 245
- Respondent 74: Room 425
- Respondent 113: Room 268

So, the patient in room 245 is respondent 146. Now, I need to find out their doctor and admission type. 

Looking at respondent 146's answers:
- Doctor: DOC_146
- Admission Type: B (from the MCQ, the options are A. Elective, B. Emergency, C. Urgent). So, Admission Type is Emergency.

Now, the task is to find all respondents who have the same doctor (DOC_146) and the same admission type (Emergency). Let's check each respondent:

1. Respondent 43:
   - Doctor: DOC_43
   - Admission Type: A (Elective)
   → Doesn't match.

2. Respondent 79:
   - Doctor: DOC_79
   - Admission Type: C (Urgent)
   → Doesn't match.

3. Respondent 146:
   - Doctor: DOC_146
   - Admission Type: B (Emergency)
   → This is the original patient, but the question might include them. Wait, the task says ""all respondents"" so including themselves is okay if they meet the criteria. But let's check the others.

4. Respondent 74:
   - Doctor: DOC_74
   - Admission Type: B (Emergency)
   → Doctor doesn't match, but admission type does. But the requirement is both same doctor and same admission type. So no.

5. Respondent 113:
   - Doctor: DOC_113
   - Admission Type: A (Elective)
   → Doesn't match.

So, only respondent 146 has Doctor DOC_146 and Admission Type Emergency. Are there any others with the same doctor? Let me check again. All other respondents have different doctors. Therefore, the only respondent is 146. But wait, the question says ""the same doctor as the patient in room 245"" (which is DOC_146) and same admission type (Emergency). So only respondent 146 themselves. But maybe the question wants others, but in this data, there's no one else. So the answer is just 146.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
List all respondents who are treated by the same doctor as the patient in room '300' and were admitted for the same admission type.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to list all respondents who are treated by the same doctor as the patient in room '300' and were admitted for the same admission type. 

First, I need to find out which patient is in room 300. Looking at the responses data, I'll check each respondent's ""Room Number"" answer. 

Scanning through the responses:

- Respondent 120: Room 361
- Respondent 78: Room 310
- Respondent 104: Room 300 (found here)
- Respondent 70: Room 424
- Respondent 129: Room 318
- Respondent 139: Room 330

So, the patient in room 300 is respondent 104. Now, I need to note their doctor and admission type. 

For respondent 104:
- Doctor: DOC_104
- Admission Type: A (which maps to ""Elective"" according to the questions schema for Admission Type: [MCQ: A. Elective B. Emergency C. Urgent])

Now, I need to find all other respondents who have the same doctor (DOC_104) and the same admission type (Elective). 

Looking through the responses again:

Check each respondent's Doctor and Admission Type:

1. Respondent 120: Doctor DOC_120, Admission Type C (Urgent) → Doesn't match.
2. Respondent 78: Doctor DOC_78, Admission Type C (Urgent) → Doesn't match.
3. Respondent 104: Already the reference, so skip.
4. Respondent 70: Doctor DOC_70, Admission Type A (Elective) → Doctor doesn't match.
5. Respondent 129: Doctor DOC_129, Admission Type A (Elective) → Doctor doesn't match.
6. Respondent 139: Doctor DOC_139, Admission Type C (Urgent) → Doesn't match.

None of the other respondents have Doctor DOC_104 and Admission Type Elective. Therefore, there are no other respondents meeting the criteria. The only one is respondent 104, but since the task is to list others treated by the same doctor and same admission type, and the question might be implying to exclude the original patient, the answer would be none. However, I need to confirm if the original patient (respondent 104) should be included. The task says ""all respondents"" who meet the criteria, so if the original is included, but looking at the example given in the problem, when the answer was ""None"", perhaps the original patient is excluded. Wait, in the example, the user asked for doctor DOC_107 and hospital HOSP_148, and the answer was ""None"" because none of the respondents matched. So in this case, the original patient (respondent 104) is the only one with DOC_104 and Elective, but the task is to list others. Wait, the task says ""treated by the same doctor as the patient in room '300' and same admission type"". So the patient in room 300 is part of the group. So we need to include that patient and any others. But in the data, only respondent 104 is in room 300, and no other respondents have DOC_104 and Elective. So the answer would be just respondent 104. But wait, the example had an answer of ""None"" when no matches. Wait, but in the example, the user was looking for DOC_107 and HOSP_148, which didn't exist. Here, the patient in room 300 is respondent 104, and the question is to find all respondents (including themselves?) who have the same doctor and admission type. So if the task is to include the original patient, then the answer would be 104. If not, then none. But the example's answer was ""None"" when there were no matches. Let me check the task again: ""List all respondents who are treated by the same doctor as the patient in room '300' and were admitted for the same admission type."" So it's all respondents (including the patient in room 300) who meet the criteria. But in the data, only respondent 104 has DOC_104 and Elective. So the answer should be 104. But wait, the example's answer was ""None"" when there were no matches. So in this case, if there is at least one (the original patient), then the answer is 104. However, perhaps the task is to find other respondents besides the one in room 300. The wording is ambiguous. Let me re-read the task: ""List all respondents who are treated by the same doctor as the patient in room '300' and were admitted for the same admission type."" The patient in room 300 is part of the respondents. So the answer should include respondent 104 if they are the only one. But looking at the data, respondent 104 is the only one with DOC_104 and Elective. So the answer is 104. But wait, in the data, let's check again:

Respondent 104: Doctor DOC_104, Admission Type A (Elective)
Other respondents:

- 70: Admission Type A (Elective) but Doctor DOC_70
- 129: Admission Type A (Elective) but Doctor DOC_129

So no one else has both DOC_104 and Elective. Therefore, only respondent 104 meets the criteria. But the task is to list all respondents, including the original? If yes, then the answer is 104. But perhaps the task wants others, not including the original. The example's answer was ""None"" when there were no matches. But in the example, the user was looking for a specific doctor and hospital, which didn't exist. Here, the original patient exists. So the answer should be 104. However, the example's answer was ""None"" when there were no matches. So if the original patient is the only one, then the answer is 104. But the output rules say for a list, provide a comma-separated list. So the answer would be ""104"". But let me check the output rules again. The output rules state: ""If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., '17, 21, 23')"". So in this case, the answer should be ""104"". But wait, the original patient is in room 300, and the task is to list all respondents who are treated by the same doctor and same admission type. So if the original is included, then 104 is the answer. If not, then none. The task doesn't specify excluding the original. So the answer is 104. But according to the data, there's only one. So the answer is 104. But let me check again. The data for respondent 104: Doctor DOC_104, Admission Type A (Elective). No other respondents have DOC_104. So the answer is 104. But the example had an answer of ""None"" when there were no matches. So in this case, the answer is ""104"".

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
List all respondents who are treated by the same doctor as the patient in room '268' and were admitted for the same admission type.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The goal is to find all respondents who are treated by the same doctor as the patient in room '268' and were admitted for the same admission type.

First, I need to identify the patient in room '268'. Let's look through the responses. Scanning each respondent's answers for the ""Room Number"" field. 

Looking at respondent 113, their room number is 268. So that's the patient we need to start with. Now, from this patient, we need two pieces of information: their doctor and their admission type. 

For respondent 113, the doctor is DOC_113 and the admission type is ""A"". But according to the questions schema, the Admission Type is an MCQ with options A. Elective, B. Emergency, C. Urgent. So ""A"" maps to ""Elective"". 

Now, we need to find all other respondents where the Doctor is DOC_113 and the Admission Type is also ""Elective"" (which is option A). 

Let's go through each respondent:

- Respondent 21: Doctor is DOC_21, Admission Type B (Emergency) → Doesn't match.
- Respondent 11: Doctor DOC_11, Admission Type B → No.
- Respondent 111: Doctor DOC_111, Admission Type B → No.
- Respondent 83: Doctor DOC_83, Admission Type C → No.
- Respondent 65: Doctor DOC_65, Admission Type A (Elective). Doctor doesn't match DOC_113.
- Respondent 7: Doctor DOC_07, Admission Type B → No.
- Respondent 24: Doctor DOC_24, Admission Type B → No.
- Respondent 59: Doctor DOC_59, Admission Type C → No.
- Respondent 148: Doctor DOC_148, Admission Type C → No.
- Respondent 6: Doctor DOC_06, Admission Type A. Doctor doesn't match.
- Respondent 69: Doctor DOC_69, Admission Type B → No.

Only respondent 113 themselves have Doctor DOC_113 and Admission Type A (Elective). Are there any others? Let me check again. 

Looking back at all responses, no other respondent has Doctor DOC_113. So the only one is respondent 113. 

But wait, the task says ""the same doctor as the patient in room 268"" (which is DOC_113) and same admission type (Elective). So the answer should be respondent 113. But the question is asking for all respondents, so including the original patient? The example given in the problem had an answer of ""None"", but in this case, the original patient would be included unless the question specifies to exclude them. The task doesn't say to exclude, so we include them. 

Therefore, the list is just respondent 113.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondents have a calculated length of stay greater than 6 days and do not have a medical condition of 'Cancer'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find which respondents have a length of stay greater than 6 days and do not have a medical condition of 'Cancer'. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The responses are in the 'responses' array, each with a respondent ID and their answers. The medical condition is an MCQ field, so I need to map the answer code to the actual condition. The medical condition options are A. Arthritis, B. Asthma, C. Cancer, D. Diabetes, E. Hypertension, F. Obesity. So, if a respondent's answer for Medical Condition is 'C', that's Cancer. We need to exclude those.

Next, calculate the length of stay. That's the difference between Discharge Date and Date of Admission. Both are in YYYY-MM-DD format. I'll need to parse these dates, calculate the difference in days, and check if it's more than 6.

Let's go through each respondent:

1. **Respondent 45**:
   - Medical Condition: F (Obesity) → not Cancer. Good.
   - Date of Admission: 2022-10-12
   - Discharge Date: 2022-09-25. Wait, discharge is before admission? That can't be right. Maybe a typo? Let me check again. Admission is 2022-10-12, discharge 2022-09-25. That's impossible. Negative days. Maybe the dates are swapped? If that's the case, maybe it's a data entry error. But according to the data given, the length would be negative, which is less than 6 days. So this respondent doesn't qualify.

2. **Respondent 121**:
   - Medical Condition: E (Hypertension) → not Cancer.
   - Admission: 2021-10-27
   - Discharge: 2021-11-21
   - Calculate days: From 10-27 to 11-21. October has 31 days, so 31 - 27 = 4 days in October, plus 21 in November → 4 +21 =25 days. 25 >6. So this qualifies.

3. **Respondent 133**:
   - Medical Condition: C (Cancer) → Exclude. So even if their stay is long, they are excluded.

4. **Respondent 114**:
   - Medical Condition: D (Diabetes) → not Cancer.
   - Admission: 2024-01-04
   - Discharge: 2023-11-08. Again, discharge before admission. That's another data inconsistency. The discharge is in 2023, admission in 2024. So negative days. Doesn't qualify.

5. **Respondent 72**:
   - Medical Condition: E (Hypertension) → not Cancer.
   - Admission: 2020-05-15
   - Discharge: 2020-06-14. Let's calculate: May has 31 days. 31 -15 =16 days in May. Then June 14 days. Total 16 +14 =30 days. 30 >6. So this qualifies.

So the qualifying respondents are 121 and 72. But wait, let me double-check the dates for respondent 45 and 114. Maybe I made a mistake. For respondent 45, admission is 2022-10-12, discharge 2022-09-25. That's definitely a negative duration. So no. Respondent 114's dates are 2024-01-04 admitted, discharged 2023-11-08. Also negative. So only 121 and 72 meet the criteria. 

Wait, but respondent 72's discharge date is 2020-06-14, which is after admission on 2020-05-15. So 30 days. Correct. 

So the final answer should be respondents 121 and 72. Let me check the medical conditions again. 121: E is Hypertension. 72: E is Hypertension. Both are not Cancer. So yes, they qualify.
