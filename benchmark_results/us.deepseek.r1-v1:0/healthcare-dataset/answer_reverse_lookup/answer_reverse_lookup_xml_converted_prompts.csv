<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondents have a calculated length of stay greater than 11 days and do not have a medical condition of 'Asthma'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find which respondents have a length of stay greater than 11 days and do not have a medical condition of 'Asthma'. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The questionnaire has a 'responses' section with multiple respondents, each having answers to various questions. The key fields here are 'Date of Admission', 'Discharge Date', and 'Medical Condition'. 

For each respondent, I need to calculate the length of stay by finding the difference between the discharge date and admission date. Then, check if that difference is more than 11 days. Also, ensure that their medical condition isn't 'Asthma'. 

Looking at the questions schema, 'Medical Condition' is an MCQ where option B is Asthma. So, any answer with 'b' in the medical condition should be excluded. 

Now, let's go through each respondent:

1. **Respondent 142**:
   - Admission Date: 2019-11-06
   - Discharge Date: 2020-02-09
   Calculating the days between these dates. Let's see: November has 30 days, so from 6th to 30th is 24 days in November. Then December (31), January (31), and up to February 9th. Total days: 24 + 31 + 31 + 9 = 95 days. That's way over 11. 
   - Medical Condition: 'b' which maps to Asthma. So this respondent is excluded.

2. **Respondent 75**:
   - Admission: 2021-02-12
   - Discharge: 2021-01-26. Wait, that's a problem. The discharge date is before admission. That can't be right. Maybe a typo? Let me check again. The admission is 2021-02-12 and discharge 2021-01-26. That's impossible. Perhaps the dates are swapped? If it's a typo and the discharge is actually 2021-02-26, the stay would be 14 days. But since the data is as given, the length of stay would be negative, which doesn't make sense. So maybe this respondent is invalid or there's a data entry error. But according to the given data, the length is negative, so it's 0 days. So this respondent doesn't meet the >11 days criteria.

3. **Respondent 33**:
   - Admission: 2022-06-24
   - Discharge: 2022-07-25
   June has 30 days, so from 24th to 30th is 6 days. July 25th adds 25 days. Total 6 +25 =31 days. That's over 11.
   - Medical Condition: 'd' which maps to Diabetes. Not Asthma. So this respondent qualifies.

4. **Respondent 126**:
   - Admission: 2021-01-03
   - Discharge: 2020-12-08. Again, discharge before admission. Another data inconsistency. The discharge is in 2020, admission in 2021. So negative days. So length is 0. Doesn't qualify.

5. **Respondent 27**:
   - Admission: 2021-11-21
   - Discharge: 2021-11-22. That's 1 day. Less than 11. So no.

So the only respondent that meets both conditions is Respondent 33. They have a 31-day stay and their medical condition is Diabetes, not Asthma.
</think>

33

The respondent with ID 33 has a length of stay of 31 days (2022-06-24 to 2022-07-25) and their medical condition is Diabetes (option 'd'), which satisfies both conditions. All other respondents either have a length of stay ≤11 days, have Asthma, or have invalid date ranges.",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondents have a calculated length of stay greater than 7 days and do not have a medical condition of 'Arthritis'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find which respondents have a length of stay greater than 7 days and do not have a medical condition of 'Arthritis'. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The questionnaire has a 'questions' section that defines each field. The 'responses' section contains the actual data from each respondent. 

The key fields here are 'Date of Admission' and 'Discharge Date' to calculate the length of stay, and 'Medical Condition' to check if it's not 'Arthritis'. 

For each respondent, I'll calculate the number of days between their admission and discharge dates. Then, I'll check if that duration is more than 7 days. Also, I need to ensure their medical condition isn't 'Arthritis'. 

Looking at the Medical Condition question in the schema, the options are A. Arthritis, B. Asthma, etc. So, the answer for Medical Condition in the responses is a letter code. For example, if a respondent has 'a' for Medical Condition, that maps to Arthritis. We need to exclude those.

Now, let's go through each respondent:

1. **Respondent 147**:
   - Medical Condition: 'a' → Arthritis. So, exclude this one immediately.

2. **Respondent 73**:
   - Medical Condition: 'd' → Diabetes. Not Arthritis. 
   - Admission Date: 2024-01-05
   - Discharge Date: 2024-03-26
   - Calculate days between: From Jan 5 to March 26. Let's see. January has 31 days, so from Jan 5 to Jan 31 is 26 days. February 2024 is a leap year, so 29 days. March 1 to March 26 is 26 days. Total: 26 + 29 + 26 = 81 days. That's way more than 7. So include this respondent.

3. **Respondent 121**:
   - Medical Condition: 'e' → Hypertension. Not Arthritis.
   - Admission: 2021-10-27
   - Discharge: 2021-11-21
   - Days: October 27 to October 31 is 4 days. November has 21 days. Total 25 days. More than 7. Include.

4. **Respondent 123**:
   - Medical Condition: 'c' → Cancer. Not Arthritis.
   - Admission: 2019-10-13
   - Discharge: 2019-12-21
   - October 13 to Oct 31: 18 days. November: 30. December 1-21: 21. Total 18+30+21=69 days. More than 7. Include.

5. **Respondent 113**:
   - Medical Condition: 'e' → Hypertension. Not Arthritis.
   - Admission: 2021-05-14
   - Discharge: 2021-03-20. Wait, discharge date is before admission? That's impossible. Maybe a typo. Let me check the data again. The admission date is 2021-05-14 and discharge is 2021-03-20. That would mean the discharge is before admission, which can't be right. Perhaps the dates are swapped, but as per the data, we have to take them as given. If that's the case, the length of stay would be negative, which is invalid. So maybe this is an error, but according to the data, the discharge date is March 20, 2021, and admission is May 14, 2021. So the discharge is before admission. Therefore, the length of stay is negative, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps this respondent's data is invalid, but since we have to work with what's given, the length of stay would be negative, which is less than 7 days. So exclude this respondent.

So the respondents that meet the criteria (length of stay >7 days and medical condition not Arthritis) are 73, 121, 123. 

Wait, but let me double-check the dates for respondent 113. If the admission is May 14, 2021, and discharge March 20, 2021, that's impossible. So maybe it's a typo, but the data is as given. So we have to consider that the length of stay is negative, so it's not greater than 7. Therefore, exclude.

So the final list is respondents 73, 121, 123.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents who are treated by the same doctor as the patient in room '272' and were admitted for the same admission type.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to list all respondents who are treated by the same doctor as the patient in room '272' and were admitted for the same admission type. 

First, I need to find out which patient is in room 272. Looking through the responses, each respondent has a ""Room Number"" answer. Scanning the data:

- Respondent 30 has Room Number 272. Let's check their details.

For respondent 30:
- Doctor: DOC_30
- Admission Type: The answer is 'b'. Looking at the schema for Admission Type, the options are A. Elective, B. Emergency, C. Urgent. So 'b' maps to Emergency.

Now, I need to find all other respondents where Doctor is DOC_30 and Admission Type is Emergency (which is 'b' in the data). 

Looking through each respondent's Doctor and Admission Type:

- Respondent 48: Doctor DOC_48, Admission Type 'a' (Elective) → Doesn't match.
- Respondent 14: Doctor DOC_14, Admission Type 'a' → No.
- Respondent 65: DOC_65, 'a' → No.
- Respondent 123: DOC_123, 'c' (Urgent) → No.
- Respondent 30: Already the source, included.
- Respondent 17: DOC_17, 'a' → No.
- Respondent 103: DOC_103, 'b' (Emergency) → Doctor doesn't match.
- Respondent 126: DOC_126, 'b' → Doctor doesn't match.
- Respondent 19: DOC_19, 'b' → Doctor doesn't match.
- Respondent 148: DOC_148, 'c' → No.

Only respondent 30 meets both conditions. So the answer should be just respondent 30.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondents have a calculated length of stay greater than 14 days and do not have a medical condition of 'Asthma'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find respondents who have a length of stay greater than 14 days and do not have a medical condition of 'Asthma'. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The questionnaire has questions and responses. The questions define each field, including whether they are MCQ or open-ended. The responses are the actual data from each respondent.

The key fields here are ""Date of Admission"" and ""Discharge Date"" to calculate the length of stay, and ""Medical Condition"" to check if it's not Asthma. 

For each respondent, I'll need to:

1. Calculate the length of stay by finding the difference between Discharge Date and Admission Date.
2. Check if that difference is greater than 14 days.
3. Ensure the Medical Condition is not Asthma.

Let's look at each respondent one by one.

Starting with respondent 143:
- Admission Date: 2022-12-10
- Discharge Date: 2022-09-27
Wait, the discharge date is before the admission date? That doesn't make sense. Maybe a typo? If discharge is earlier, the length of stay would be negative, so this might be an error. But since the data is given, perhaps I should proceed as is. The difference would be negative, so definitely not greater than 14. So this respondent doesn't qualify.

Respondent 107:
- Admission: 2024-01-31
- Discharge: 2024-02-02
Difference is 2 days (31 to 1, 1 day in Jan, 2 days in Feb). So 2 days. Not greater than 14. So no.

Respondent 58:
- Admission: 2020-05-22
- Discharge: 2020-06-08
Calculating the days: From May 22 to June 8. May has 31 days, so 31 - 22 = 9 days in May, plus 8 in June: total 17 days. That's more than 14. 
Medical Condition: The answer is 'd'. Looking at the Medical Condition question, options are A. Arthritis, B. Asthma, C. Cancer, D. Diabetes, E. Hypertension, F. Obesity. So 'd' is Diabetes. Not Asthma. So this respondent qualifies.

Respondent 134:
- Admission: 2021-12-01
- Discharge: 2022-01-15
Calculating: From Dec 1 to Jan 15. December has 31 days, so 31 - 1 = 30 days in Dec, plus 15 in Jan: total 45 days. That's over 14. 
Medical Condition: 'f' which is Obesity. Not Asthma. So this respondent qualifies.

Respondent 98:
- Admission: 2021-04-17
- Discharge: 2021-03-11
Again, discharge before admission. Negative days. So no.

Respondent 116:
- Admission: 2020-06-23
- Discharge: 2020-06-22
Again, discharge is a day before admission. Negative. So no.

So the qualifying respondents are 58 and 134. Their medical conditions are Diabetes and Obesity, respectively, neither of which is Asthma, and their stays are 17 and 45 days, both over 14.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondents have a calculated length of stay greater than 18 days and do not have a medical condition of 'Diabetes'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find respondents who have a length of stay greater than 18 days and do not have a medical condition of 'Diabetes'. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The questionnaire has a 'questions' section that defines each field. The 'Medical Condition' is an MCQ with options including Diabetes (option D). The 'Date of Admission' and 'Discharge Date' are open-ended fields, so I can use those to calculate the length of stay.

For each respondent, I'll calculate the length of stay by finding the difference between the discharge date and admission date. The dates are in YYYY-MM-DD format, so I can parse them into date objects and subtract to get the number of days. 

But wait, I need to be careful with the date format. For example, if admission is 2024-04-05 and discharge is 2024-02-10, that would result in a negative number, which doesn't make sense. That might be a data entry error. Hmm, looking at respondent 77, their admission date is 2024-04-05 and discharge is 2024-02-10. That's impossible because discharge is before admission. Maybe it's a typo, but since the data is given as is, I have to work with it. However, a negative length of stay would be invalid, so perhaps those entries should be excluded. But the problem doesn't mention handling data errors, so I'll proceed as per the data provided, but note that negative stays would be considered as 0 or invalid. Wait, but the question is asking for length of stay greater than 18 days. If the discharge is before admission, the length would be negative, which is not greater than 18. So those respondents would automatically be excluded. So maybe I can proceed.

Next, for each respondent, check if their medical condition is not 'Diabetes' (option D). Then calculate their length of stay. If the length is >18 days, include them in the result.

Let's go through each respondent one by one.

Respondent 77:
- Medical Condition: answer is 'b' which maps to 'Asthma' (from the schema: Medical Condition options are A. Arthritis B. Asthma C. Cancer D. Diabetes E. Hypertension F. Obesity). So not Diabetes.
- Admission: 2024-04-05, Discharge: 2024-02-10. The discharge is before admission, so the stay is negative. So not >18. Exclude.

Respondent 110:
- Medical Condition: 'f' which is 'Obesity'. Not Diabetes.
- Admission: 2019-12-12, Discharge: 2019-08-21. Again, discharge is before admission. Negative days. Exclude.

Respondent 79:
- Medical Condition: 'b' (Asthma). Not Diabetes.
- Admission: 2021-01-07, Discharge: 2020-12-18. Again, discharge before admission. Negative. Exclude.

Respondent 146:
- Medical Condition: 'd' (Diabetes). So exclude this respondent because they have Diabetes.

Respondent 16:
- Medical Condition: 'e' (Hypertension). Not Diabetes.
- Admission: 2020-01-24, Discharge: 2019-12-13. Discharge before admission. Negative. Exclude.

Respondent 26:
- Medical Condition: 'd' (Diabetes). Exclude.

Respondent 54:
- Medical Condition: 'd' (Diabetes). Exclude.

Respondent 55:
- Medical Condition: 'e' (Hypertension). Not Diabetes.
- Admission: 2024-03-17, Discharge: 2024-04-22. Let's calculate the days between these dates. March has 31 days, so from March 17 to March 31 is 14 days. April 1 to April 22 is 22 days. Total 14 + 22 = 36 days. So 36 days, which is greater than 18. Include this respondent (id 55).

Respondent 68:
- Medical Condition: 'c' (Cancer). Not Diabetes.
- Admission: 2022-08-22, Discharge: 2022-09-18. August has 31 days. From 22 to 31 August: 9 days (including 22nd). Then September 1-18: 18 days. Total 9 + 18 = 27 days. >18. Include (id 68).

Respondent 21:
- Medical Condition: 'a' (Arthritis). Not Diabetes.
- Admission: 2021-11-13, Discharge: 2021-08-19. Discharge before admission. Negative. Exclude.

Respondent 41:
- Medical Condition: 'f' (Obesity). Not Diabetes.
- Admission: 2021-09-10, Discharge: 2021-09-18. That's 8 days (from 10th to 18th inclusive is 9 days? Wait, 10 to 11 is 1 day, so 18-10=8 days. So 8 days. Not >18. Exclude.

Respondent 62:
- Medical Condition: 'c' (Cancer). Not Diabetes.
- Admission: 2024-02-22, Discharge: 2024-02-04. Discharge before admission. Negative. Exclude.

So the only respondents that meet the criteria are 55 and 68. Let me double-check their calculations.

For respondent 55:
Admission: 2024-03-17, Discharge: 2024-04-22. March 17 to April 22. March has 31 days. 31 -17 +1 = 15 days in March (including 17th). April 1-22 is 22 days. Total 15 +22 =37 days. Wait, earlier I thought 14+22=36. Let me recalculate. March 17 to March 31: 31-17=14 days, but since the 17th is included, it's 15 days (17th to 31st inclusive). Then April 1-22 is 22 days. Total 15+22=37 days. So 37 days, which is >18. Correct.

Respondent 68:
Admission: 2022-08-22, Discharge: 2022-09-18. August 22 to August 31: 10 days (22-31 inclusive is 10 days). September 1-18: 18 days. Total 28 days. So 28>18. Correct.

So the answer should be respondents 55 and 68. Their IDs are 55 and 68.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents who are treated by the same doctor as the patient in room '245' and were admitted for the same admission type.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to list all respondents who are treated by the same doctor as the patient in room '245' and were admitted for the same admission type. 

First, I need to find out which patient is in room 245. Looking through the responses, each respondent has a ""Room Number"" answer. Let me check each one:

- Respondent 43: Room 468
- Respondent 79: Room 300
- Respondent 146: Room 245
- Respondent 74: Room 425
- Respondent 113: Room 268

So, the patient in room 245 is respondent 146. Now, I need to find out their doctor and admission type. 

Looking at respondent 146's data:
- Doctor: DOC_146
- Admission Type: The answer is ""b"". The Admission Type question is an MCQ with options A. Elective, B. Emergency, C. Urgent. So ""b"" maps to Emergency.

Now, I need to find all other respondents who have Doctor = DOC_146 and Admission Type = Emergency (option B). Let's check each respondent:

- Respondent 43: Doctor DOC_43, Admission Type ""a"" (Elective) → Doesn't match.
- Respondent 79: Doctor DOC_79, Admission Type ""c"" (Urgent) → Doesn't match.
- Respondent 146: That's the original patient, so we might exclude them if the question wants others, but the task says ""all respondents"" including possibly this one. Let's check the task again. The task says ""treated by the same doctor as the patient in room '245'"", so including respondent 146 if they meet the criteria. But since the doctor is DOC_146, and the admission type is Emergency, we need to see if others have the same.

- Respondent 74: Doctor DOC_74, Admission Type ""b"" (Emergency). Doctor doesn't match DOC_146.
- Respondent 113: Doctor DOC_113, Admission Type ""a"" (Elective). Doesn't match.

So, the only respondent that matches both conditions (Doctor DOC_146 and Admission Type Emergency) is respondent 146 themselves. But wait, the original patient is in room 245, which is respondent 146. The question is asking for all respondents treated by the same doctor as that patient and same admission type. If there are no other respondents with DOC_146 and Emergency, then only respondent 146 is the answer. But let me double-check the data again to be sure.

Looking through all respondents again, no one else has Doctor DOC_146. All other doctors are DOC_43, DOC_79, DOC_74, DOC_113. So the only one is respondent 146. However, sometimes such questions might exclude the original patient, but the task says ""all respondents"" without such exclusion. Therefore, the answer is respondent 146.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents who are treated by the same doctor as the patient in room '300' and were admitted for the same admission type.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to list all respondents who are treated by the same doctor as the patient in room '300' and were admitted for the same admission type. 

First, I need to find out which patient is in room 300. Looking at the responses, each respondent has a ""Room Number"" answer. Let me check each one:

- Respondent 120: Room 361
- Respondent 78: Room 310
- Respondent 104: Room 300 → This is the patient we need.
- Respondent 70: Room 424
- Respondent 129: Room 318
- Respondent 139: Room 330

So, the patient in room 300 is respondent 104. Now, I need to find out their doctor and admission type. 

For respondent 104:
- Doctor: DOC_104
- Admission Type: The answer is 'a'. Looking at the Admission Type question in the schema, the options are A. Elective, B. Emergency, C. Urgent. So 'a' maps to Elective.

Now, I need to find all other respondents who have Doctor = DOC_104 and Admission Type = Elective. Let's check each respondent:

- Respondent 120: Doctor DOC_120, Admission Type 'c' (Urgent) → Doesn't match.
- Respondent 78: Doctor DOC_78, Admission Type 'c' (Urgent) → Doesn't match.
- Respondent 104: Already the source, but we need others, so maybe include or exclude? The task says ""all respondents"" which might include the original if there are others. But let's check others.
- Respondent 70: Doctor DOC_70, Admission Type 'a' (Elective). Doctor doesn't match DOC_104.
- Respondent 129: Doctor DOC_129, Admission Type 'a' (Elective). Doctor doesn't match.
- Respondent 139: Doctor DOC_139, Admission Type 'c' (Urgent). Doesn't match.

Wait, none of the other respondents have Doctor DOC_104. So the only one is respondent 104. But the task says ""all respondents"" treated by the same doctor and same admission type. Since the original patient (104) is in room 300, and their doctor is DOC_104 with admission type Elective, are there any others with DOC_104 and Elective?

Looking again, all other respondents have different doctors. So the answer would only be respondent 104. But the question might be asking for others, excluding the original. However, the task doesn't specify to exclude the original. So if the original is included, then 104 is the only one. If not, then none. But the example given in the first part had an answer of ""None"" when no matches, but in this case, the original is a match. Wait, the task says ""the same doctor as the patient in room '300'"", which is DOC_104, and same admission type (Elective). So respondent 104 themselves would be included. But maybe the question wants others besides the original? The wording is ambiguous. However, typically, such questions include the original unless specified otherwise. Let me check the data again.

Looking at the data, respondent 104 is the only one with Doctor DOC_104. So the answer is just 104. But let me confirm:

- Doctor for 104: DOC_104
- Admission Type: Elective (a)

Other respondents:

- 120: DOC_120, Urgent (c)
- 78: DOC_78, Urgent (c)
- 70: DOC_70, Elective (a) → Same admission type but different doctor.
- 129: DOC_129, Elective (a) → Same admission type but different doctor.
- 139: DOC_139, Urgent (c)

So no other respondents have both DOC_104 and Elective. Therefore, only respondent 104 meets both conditions. But the task says ""list all respondents"", so the answer is 104. However, in the example given, when there were no matches, the answer was ""None"". But here, there is one match. So the answer should be 104.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
List all respondents who are treated by the same doctor as the patient in room '268' and were admitted for the same admission type.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to list all respondents who are treated by the same doctor as the patient in room '268' and were admitted for the same admission type. 

First, I need to find out which patient is in room 268. Looking through the responses, each respondent has a ""Room Number"" answer. Let me scan each respondent's data.

Starting with respondent id=""113"": Room Number is 268. So this is the patient in room 268. Now, I need to note their doctor and admission type. 

For respondent 113, the Doctor is DOC_113 and the Admission Type is ""a"". According to the questions schema, Admission Type is a MCQ with options A. Elective, B. Emergency, C. Urgent. So ""a"" maps to Elective. 

Now, I need to find all other respondents where Doctor is DOC_113 and Admission Type is Elective. Let's check each respondent:

- Respondent 21: Doctor is DOC_21, so no.
- Respondent 11: Doctor is DOC_11, no.
- Respondent 111: Doctor DOC_111, no.
- Respondent 83: DOC_83, no.
- Respondent 65: DOC_65, no.
- Respondent 7: DOC_07, no.
- Respondent 24: DOC_24, no.
- Respondent 59: DOC_59, no.
- Respondent 148: DOC_148, no.
- Respondent 6: DOC_06, no.
- Respondent 69: DOC_69, no.

Only respondent 113 has Doctor DOC_113 and Admission Type Elective. Are there any others with the same doctor? From the data provided, it seems not. So the only respondent meeting both conditions is 113 themselves. But the question says ""all respondents"" including the original patient? The example given in the problem had an answer of ""None"" when no matches were found except the original, but in this case, the original is the only one. However, the task is to list all respondents who meet the criteria, which would include the original if there are no others. Wait, but maybe the original patient is excluded? Let me check the example again. In the example, the query was for doctor DOC_107 and hospital HOSP_148, and the answer was ""None"". Looking at the data, the respondent with HOSP_148 is id 148, but their doctor is DOC_148, not DOC_107. So in that case, no matches. 

In our current task, the original patient (id 113) is in room 268. The question is asking for others treated by the same doctor and same admission type. If the original is the only one, then the answer would be just 113. But maybe the task wants others, excluding the original. The wording is ""list all respondents who are treated by the same doctor as the patient in room '268' and were admitted for the same admission type."" The patient in room 268 is part of the respondents, so unless specified to exclude, they should be included. 

Looking at the data again, respondent 113 is the only one with Doctor DOC_113 and Admission Type a (Elective). So the answer is respondent 113. But let me double-check all respondents again to be sure. Yes, all other respondents have different doctors. Therefore, the list is just 113.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondents have a calculated length of stay greater than 6 days and do not have a medical condition of 'Cancer'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find which respondents have a length of stay greater than 6 days and do not have a medical condition of 'Cancer'. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The questionnaire has a 'responses' section with multiple respondents, each having various answers. The key fields here are 'Date of Admission', 'Discharge Date', and 'Medical Condition'. 

For each respondent, I need to calculate the length of stay by finding the difference between the discharge date and admission date. Then, check if that difference is more than 6 days. Also, ensure their medical condition isn't 'Cancer'.

Looking at the data:

Starting with respondent 45:
- Admission Date: 2022-10-12
- Discharge Date: 2022-09-25
Wait, that's a problem. The discharge date is before the admission date. That can't be right. Maybe a typo? Let me check again. The admission is 2022-10-12 and discharge 2022-09-25. That's impossible, so perhaps the dates are swapped. But since the data is given as is, maybe it's an error. In that case, the length of stay would be negative, which doesn't make sense. So this respondent might be excluded or considered as 0 days. But since the question is about stays longer than 6 days, this one probably doesn't qualify. Also, their medical condition is 'f', which maps to 'Obesity' (from the schema: Medical Condition options are A. Arthritis B. Asthma C. Cancer D. Diabetes E. Hypertension F. Obesity). So not Cancer. But the date issue complicates things. Maybe it's a typo, but without more info, I have to take the dates as given. So length of stay is negative, which is less than 6 days. So this respondent doesn't meet the criteria.

Next, respondent 121:
- Admission: 2021-10-27
- Discharge: 2021-11-21
Calculating the days between these dates. From October 27 to November 21. October has 31 days, so 31 - 27 = 4 days in October, plus 21 days in November: total 25 days. 25 > 6. Medical condition is 'e' which is 'Hypertension'. Not Cancer. So this respondent qualifies.

Respondent 133:
- Admission: 2023-10-15
- Discharge: 2024-01-02
Calculating the days. From October 15 to January 2. Let's break it down:
October: 15 to 31 → 16 days
November: 30 days
December: 31 days
January: 2 days
Total: 16 + 30 +31 +2 = 79 days. Definitely more than 6. Medical condition is 'c' which is 'Cancer'. So this one is excluded.

Respondent 114:
- Admission: 2024-01-04
- Discharge: 2023-11-08
Again, discharge before admission. That's impossible. So negative days. So length of stay is negative. Doesn't qualify. Medical condition is 'd' (Diabetes). But since the stay is invalid, they don't meet the criteria.

Respondent 72:
- Admission: 2020-05-15
- Discharge: 2020-06-14
Calculating days: May has 31 days. 31 -15 = 16 days in May, plus 14 in June → 30 days total. 30 >6. Medical condition is 'e' (Hypertension). Not Cancer. So this respondent qualifies.

So the qualifying respondents are 121 and 72. But wait, let me double-check the dates for respondent 45 and 114. Maybe I misread. For 45, admission is 2022-10-12 and discharge 2022-09-25. That's definitely discharge before admission. So invalid. For 114, admission 2024-01-04 and discharge 2023-11-08. Also discharge before admission. So those two are invalid. 

So the final answer should be respondents 121 and 72. Let me check their IDs again. Yes, 121 and 72. Their medical conditions are not Cancer, and their stays are valid and over 6 days.
