<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the billing amount of the respondent 56?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question. The task is to find the billing amount of respondent 56.

First, I need to look at the data provided. The responses section lists several respondents, each with their details. I should locate respondent 56 specifically.

Looking through the list, I see Respondent 56's entry. Under their details, the ""Billing Amount"" is listed as 19747. Since the question asks for the billing amount, which is an open-ended field according to the questions schema, I just need to report the exact value provided. There's no MCQ involved here, so no need to map any codes. The answer should be the number 19747.

</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question. The task is to find the insurance provider of respondent 57.

First, I need to look at the data provided. The questions section tells me that question 8 is about the insurance provider, which is a multiple-choice question (MCQ) with options A. Aetna, B. Blue Cross, C. Cigna, D. Medicare, E. UnitedHealthcare. 

Now, I'll check the responses for respondent 57. Looking at their entry, under ""Insurance Provider"" it says ""d"". According to the MCQ options, option D corresponds to Medicare. 

I need to make sure I'm mapping the letter correctly. The options are A to E, and each has a specific provider. Since the response is ""d"", the correct answer should be Medicare. 

I also need to verify that there's no other information or possible mistakes. The respondent's data doesn't show any other entries for insurance provider, so it's definitely ""d"". 

Following the output rules, I should provide the text value of the MCQ option, not the letter. So the answer is Medicare.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the admission type of the respondent 72?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question. The task is to find the admission type of Respondent 72.

First, I need to look at the data provided. The questions section tells me that Admission Type is an MCQ with options A. Elective, B. Emergency, C. Urgent. The responses for Respondent 72 show that their Admission Type is 'b'. 

According to the MCQ mapping, 'b' corresponds to Emergency. So the answer should be Emergency. I need to make sure there's no other respondent with ID 72 and that I'm looking at the correct field. Checking the response again, yes, Respondent 72's Admission Type is 'b', which maps directly to Emergency. No other processing needed here. The answer is straightforward.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the medical condition of the patient with medication = 'Penicillin' and room number = '482'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the medical condition of a patient who has medication 'Penicillin' and is in room number '482'. 

First, I need to look at the data provided. Let me start by understanding the schema. The questions section tells me that 'Medical Condition' is an MCQ with options A to F, corresponding to Arthritis, Asthma, Cancer, Diabetes, Hypertension, Obesity. The 'Medication' field is also an MCQ with options A to E: Aspirin, Ibuprofen, Lipitor, Paracetamol, Penicillin. The 'Room Number' is an open-ended question, so the response is a direct number.

Now, I need to go through each respondent's data to find the one that matches both 'Medication' as Penicillin (which would be option E) and 'Room Number' as 482. Let's check each respondent one by one.

Starting with Respondent 89: Their medication is 'b', which maps to Ibuprofen. Room number is 424. Doesn't match.

Respondent 68: Medication is 'b' (Ibuprofen), room 231. Not a match.

Respondent 12: Medication 'b' again, room 428. Nope.

Respondent 118: Medication 'b' (Ibuprofen), room 212. Still not.

Respondent 138: Medication 'd' (Paracetamol), room 133. Not it.

Respondent 32: Medication 'c' (Lipitor), room 500. No.

Respondent 97: Medication 'd' (Paracetamol), room 307. Doesn't fit.

Respondent 21: Medication 'e' (Penicillin). Oh, here's Penicillin. But check the room number: 251. Not 482. So close, but not the one.

Respondent 142: Let's see. Medication is 'e' (Penicillin), and room number is 482. That's exactly the criteria! Now, their medical condition is listed as 'b'. Looking back at the Medical Condition options, 'b' corresponds to Asthma. 

Wait, let me double-check. The Medical Condition options are A. Arthritis, B. Asthma, C. Cancer, D. Diabetes, E. Hypertension, F. Obesity. So 'b' is Asthma. 

So the answer should be Asthma. Let me confirm there are no other respondents. Respondent 76: Medication 'd' (Paracetamol), room 306. No. 

Only Respondent 142 meets both conditions. Their medical condition is Asthma.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the billing amount of the patient with blood type = 'AB+' and medical condition = 'Diabetes'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the billing amount of the patient who has blood type 'AB+' and a medical condition of 'Diabetes'. 

First, I need to refer to the questions section to understand the MCQ options. For blood type, the options are A. A+, B. A-, C. AB+, D. AB-, E. B+, F. B-, G. O+, H. O-. So, 'AB+' corresponds to option C. For the medical condition, the options are A. Arthritis, B. Asthma, C. Cancer, D. Diabetes, E. Hypertension, F. Obesity. So, 'Diabetes' is option D.

Now, I'll go through each respondent in the responses to find those with Blood Type 'c' (since C is AB+) and Medical Condition 'd' (Diabetes). 

Looking at Respondent 12: Blood Type is c (AB+), Medical Condition is d (Diabetes). Their billing amount is 45820. 

Checking other respondents: Respondent 50 has Medical Condition d but Blood Type a. Respondent 26 has Medical Condition d and Blood Type c as well. Wait, Respondent 26's Blood Type is c (AB+), Medical Condition d (Diabetes). Their billing amount is 23737. 

Wait, so there are two respondents with AB+ and Diabetes? Let me check again. 

Respondent 12: Blood Type c (AB+), Medical Condition d (Diabetes) → Billing 45820.  
Respondent 26: Blood Type c (AB+), Medical Condition d (Diabetes) → Billing 23737. 

But the question asks for the billing amount. The answer should list both? Wait, but the question is phrased as ""the patient"", implying a single answer. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.

Wait, looking at the data:

Respondent 12:
- Blood Type: c (AB+)
- Medical Condition: d (Diabetes)
- Billing Amount: 45820

Respondent 26:
- Blood Type: c (AB+)
- Medical Condition: d (Diabetes)
- Billing Amount: 23737

So there are two patients matching the criteria. But the question is asking for ""the patient"", which might be a mistake if there are multiple. However, maybe I missed something. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I misread the data. Let me confirm each respondent:

Respondent 12: Blood Type is c (AB+), Medical Condition d (Diabetes). Correct.

Respondent 26: Blood Type is c (AB+), Medical Condition d (Diabetes). Correct.

So both have the required attributes. The question might have intended for one answer, but according to the data, there are two. However, the answer format requires a single value. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the data. Let me check again.

Wait, looking at the data again:

Respondent 12's Medical Condition is d, which is Diabetes. Blood Type c is AB+.

Respondent 26's Medical Condition is d (Diabetes), Blood Type c (AB+). 

So both are correct. Therefore, the billing amounts are 45820 and 23737. But the question is phrased as ""the patient"", which might be an error if there are multiple. However, in the example provided, the answer was a single number. Maybe in this dataset, there's only one such patient. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in reading the data. Let me check again.

Wait, looking at Respondent 12's data:

- Blood Type: c (AB+)
- Medical Condition: d (Diabetes)
- Billing: 45820

Respondent 26:

- Blood Type: c (AB+)
- Medical Condition: d (Diabetes)
- Billing: 23737

So two entries. But the question is asking for ""the billing amount"", which might imply a single answer. This could be a trick question where the answer is both, but the output rules say if it's a list, provide a comma-separated list. However, the example answer was a single number. Wait, the example had a single answer. Let me check if I made a mistake in the data.

Wait, let me check Respondent 26's Medical Condition again. The data says Medical Condition: d. The options for Medical Condition are D. Diabetes. So yes, both 12 and 26 have AB+ and Diabetes. Therefore, the correct answer should be both billing amounts. But the output rules state that if the question asks for a list, provide a comma-separated list. The task here is to find the billing amount(s) of the patient(s) meeting the criteria. Since there are two, the answer should be ""23737, 45820"" or ""45820, 23737"". But I need to check the order. The respondents are listed in the data in the order 148,50,18,12,59,75,21,60,26,98. So Respondent 12 comes before 26. But the order might not matter. However, the output should list both. But the example answer was a single value, but in that case, there was only one matching respondent. Here, there are two. Therefore, the correct answer is both billing amounts. But the user might have intended one. Let me check again if I misread any of the data.

Wait, Respondent 12's Admission Type is b (Emergency?), let me check the Admission Type options. Admission Type is MCQ: A. Elective B. Emergency C. Urgent. So 'b' is Emergency. But the current task is about blood type and medical condition, not admission type. So that's not relevant here. 

So, the answer should be the billing amounts of both patients: 45820 and 23737. But the output format says if the question asks for a list, provide a comma-separated list. The task is asking for ""the billing amount"", which is singular, but there are two patients. Therefore, the answer should list both amounts. However, perhaps I made a mistake in the data. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps Respondent 26's Blood Type is c, which is AB+? Yes. Medical Condition d is Diabetes. So both are correct. Therefore, the answer is two billing amounts. But the example had a single answer. Maybe the user expects both. So the answer is 23737,45820. But the order? The respondents are ordered as 12 and 26. So 12's amount is 45820, 26's is 23737. So the answer would be ""45820, 23737"" or ""23737, 45820"". The output rules say for a list, comma-separated. So the correct answer is both values. But I need to confirm once more.

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.

What is the medical condition of the patient with room number = '406' and date of admission = '2022-07-08'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the medical condition of the patient who has room number 406 and was admitted on 2022-07-08. 

First, I need to look through the responses provided. Each respondent has a set of data points. Let me go through each respondent one by one to check their room number and date of admission.

Starting with Respondent 117: Room number is 249, admission date 2021-01-17. Not matching.

Respondent 94: Room 327, admission 2020-08-26. Nope.

Respondent 42: Room 152, admission 2019-08-16. Not it.

Respondent 95: Room 138, admission 2019-08-20. Still not matching.

Respondent 91: Here we go. Room number is 406, and the date of admission is 2022-07-08. That's exactly the criteria we're looking for. 

Now, checking the medical condition for Respondent 91. The data shows ""Medical Condition: b"". Looking back at the questions section, the Medical Condition options are A. Arthritis, B. Asthma, C. Cancer, D. Diabetes, E. Hypertension, F. Obesity. So option B corresponds to Asthma. 

Therefore, the medical condition should be Asthma. Let me double-check to make sure there are no other respondents with the same room and admission date. Scanning through the rest: Respondent 54, 69, 19, 44. None of them have room 406 or the admission date in question. So Respondent 91 is the correct one. The answer is Asthma.

<task>
What is the medication of the patient with medical condition = 'Diabetes' and age = '21'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the medication of a patient who has a medical condition of Diabetes and is 21 years old. 

First, I need to look at the data provided. Let's start by understanding the structure. The questions section defines each field, and the responses are from various respondents. 

The key fields here are Medical Condition and Age. The medical condition is an MCQ with options like Diabetes (option D). The age is an open-ended response, so we're looking for exactly '21' in the Age field.

Now, I'll go through each respondent to check if they meet both criteria: Medical Condition is Diabetes and Age is 21.

Starting with Respondent 42: Age is 76, Medical Condition is C. According to the schema, Medical Condition C is Cancer. So not Diabetes. Skip.

Respondent 119: Age 23, Medical Condition F. The options for Medical Condition F is Obesity. Not matching.

Respondent 98: Age 34, Medical Condition B (Asthma). Not relevant.

Respondent 70: Age 49, Medical Condition D (Diabetes). Oh, here's a Diabetes case, but the age is 49, not 21. So doesn't meet both criteria.

Respondent 143: Age 80, Medical Condition D (Diabetes). Again, age doesn't match.

Respondent 57: Age 21. That's the age we need. Now check the Medical Condition. It's D, which according to the schema is Diabetes. Perfect, this matches both conditions. Now, the medication for this respondent is D. Looking at the Medication options, D is Paracetamol. So the answer should be Paracetamol.

Let me double-check the other respondents to ensure there's no other match. Respondent 84: Age 40, Medical Condition F. Respondent 15: Age 69, Medical Condition A (Arthritis). No others have both Diabetes and Age 21. 

So the medication is Paracetamol.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the medication of the patient with age = '45' and billing amount = '6176'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the medication of a patient who is 45 years old and has a billing amount of 6176. 

First, I need to look through the responses provided and filter out the entries that match both criteria: Age 45 and Billing Amount 6176. Let's go through each respondent one by one.

Starting with Respondent 9. Their Age is listed as 45, which matches the first condition. The Billing Amount is 6176, which also matches the second condition. So this seems like the correct respondent. Now, looking at the Medication field for Respondent 9, it's listed as 'c'. 

Next, I need to refer back to the questions section to decode the Medication options. The Medication question is MCQ with options: A. Aspirin, B. Ibuprofen, C. Lipitor, D. Paracetamol, E. Penicillin. Since the response is 'c', that corresponds to Lipitor. 

I should check the other respondents to ensure there's no one else matching both criteria. Let's quickly scan the others:

- Respondent 81: Age 42, Billing 14681 → Doesn't match.
- Respondent 103: Age 81 → No.
- Respondent 69: Age 18 → No.
- Respondent 17: Age 19 → No.
- Respondent 55: Age 30 → No.
- Respondent 146: Age 34 → No.
- Respondent 128: Age 28 → No.

Only Respondent 9 meets both conditions. Therefore, the medication is Lipitor.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the billing amount of the patient with medical condition = 'Hypertension' and discharge date = '2022-01-16'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the billing amount of a patient who has a medical condition of 'Hypertension' and was discharged on '2022-01-16'. 

First, I need to refer to the questions section to understand the structure. The medical condition is question 4, which is an MCQ with options A to F. 'Hypertension' is option E. So, in the responses, the medical condition should be 'e'. 

Next, the discharge date is question 12, an open-ended field. We're looking for exactly '2022-01-16'.

Now, I'll go through each respondent in the responses to check these two criteria.

Starting with Respondent 118:
- Medical Condition: e (which maps to Hypertension)
- Discharge Date: 2022-01-16
That's a match! Their billing amount is 8451. 

I should check the other respondents to ensure there are no other matches. Let's quickly scan the rest:

Respondent 37: Medical Condition d (Diabetes), Discharge Date 2022-07-18 – no.
Respondent 68: Medical Condition c (Cancer) – no.
Respondent 36: Medical Condition a (Arthritis) – no.
Respondent 64: Discharge Date 2020-02-09 – no.
Respondent 144: Discharge Date 2022-11-07 – no.
Respondent 138: Discharge Date 2023-09-05 – no.
Respondent 150: Discharge Date 2020-04-22 – no.
Respondent 110: Discharge Date 2019-08-21 – no.
Respondent 103: Discharge Date 2024-01-19 – no.
Respondent 93: Discharge Date 2023-09-18 – no.

Only Respondent 118 meets both conditions. The billing amount is 8451. Since the question asks for the billing amount, the answer is 8451.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the blood type of the respondent 40?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question. The task is to find the blood type of respondent 40.

First, I need to look at the questions section to understand how the blood type is coded. The Blood Type question is a multiple-choice question (MCQ) with options A. A+, B. A-, C. AB+, D. AB-, E. B+, F. B-, G. O+, H. O-. So each letter corresponds to a specific blood type.

Now, I need to check the response for respondent 40. Looking at the responses section, under Respondent 40, the Blood Type is listed as 'c'. According to the MCQ options, option C is AB+. 

Wait, let me double-check. The options are A. A+, B. A-, C. AB+, D. AB-, etc. So 'c' maps to AB+. Therefore, the blood type should be AB+.

I should also make sure there's no other respondent 40 or any possible confusion. The list of respondents includes 36, 131, 127, 24, 13, 29, 40, 41. Yes, respondent 40 is there. Their blood type is 'c', which translates to AB+ as per the schema. No other information needed. The answer is AB+.

<task>
What is the doctor of the patient with discharge date = '2021-03-11' and medication = 'Ibuprofen'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the doctor of the patient who has a discharge date of '2021-03-11' and is taking 'Ibuprofen' as their medication. 

First, I need to look at the data provided in the responses section. Let me go through each respondent one by one to check if they meet both conditions.

Starting with Respondent 17: Discharge date is 2021-08-12, which doesn't match. Medication is 'b', which according to the questions section for medication options (A. Aspirin, B. Ibuprofen, etc.), 'b' maps to Ibuprofen. But the discharge date is wrong, so this isn't the one.

Next, Respondent 99: Discharge date is 2019-07-05. Not matching. Medication is 'c' which is Lipitor. So no.

Respondent 98: Discharge date is 2021-03-11. That's a match. Now check the medication. Their medication is 'b', which is Ibuprofen. So both conditions are met here. The doctor listed is DOC_98. 

Let me check the rest to ensure there's no other respondent that fits. 

Respondent 120: Discharge date 2021-07-01. No. Medication is 'd' (Paracetamol). 

Respondent 136: Discharge 2023-07-05. No. 

Respondent 65: Discharge 2021-12-09. No. 

Respondent 142: Discharge 2020-02-09. No. 

Respondent 3: Discharge 2019-10-19. No. 

Respondent 30: Discharge 2023-06-15. No. 

Respondent 138: Discharge 2023-09-05. No. 

Respondent 69: Discharge 2022-01-12. No. 

So only Respondent 98 meets both criteria. Therefore, the doctor is DOC_98.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the medication of the patient with medical condition = 'Cancer' and age = '67'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the medication of a patient who has a medical condition of 'Cancer' and is 67 years old. 

First, I need to look at the data provided. Let's start by understanding the schema. The medical condition is question 4, which is a multiple-choice question with options like Cancer (option C). The age is an open-ended question, so the value is a number.

Now, I'll go through each respondent in the responses section to find the one that matches both criteria: medical condition 'Cancer' and age 67.

Looking at Respondent 29: Their medical condition is 'c' (which maps to Cancer), and their age is 27. Age doesn't match, so skip.

Respondent 76: Medical condition 'e' (Hypertension), age 70. Not a match.

Respondent 112: Medical condition is 'c' (Cancer), age 67. Oh, this looks promising. Let me check the medication. The medication is 'e', which according to question 13's options (A. Aspirin, B. Ibuprofen, C. Lipitor, D. Paracetamol, E. Penicillin), 'e' corresponds to Penicillin. So the answer should be Penicillin.

Wait, let me make sure there are no other respondents. Checking the rest:

Respondent 41: Medical condition 'f' (Obesity), age 44. No.

Respondent 117: Medical condition 'c' (Cancer), age 58. Age doesn't match.

Respondent 1: Medical condition 'e' (Hypertension). No.

Respondent 68: Medical condition 'c' (Cancer), age 26. Age doesn't match.

Respondent 129: Medical condition 'd' (Diabetes). No.

Respondent 46: Medical condition 'a' (Arthritis). No.

Respondent 130: Medical condition 'd' (Diabetes). No.

So the only match is Respondent 112. Their medication is 'e', which is Penicillin. Therefore, the answer is Penicillin.

<task>
What is the admission type of the patient with blood type = 'AB+' and age = '37'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the admission type of the patient who has a blood type of AB+ and is 37 years old. 

First, I need to look at the data provided. Let's start by understanding the schema. The questions section tells me that Blood Type is an MCQ with options A. A+, B. A-, C. AB+, D. AB-, etc. So, if a response has Blood Type 'c', that maps to AB+ according to the options.

Next, the Age is an open-ended question, so the response is the exact number. We're looking for age 37.

Now, I'll go through each respondent in the responses section to find the one that matches both Blood Type 'AB+' (which is option C) and Age 37.

Looking at Respondent 40: Their Age is 37. Blood Type is 'c', which according to the schema is AB+. That's a match. Now, check the Admission Type. The Admission Type options are A. Elective, B. Emergency, C. Urgent. Respondent 40's Admission Type is 'a', which maps to Elective. 

Wait, but let me confirm. The Admission Type for Respondent 40 is listed as 'a'. According to the schema, Admission Type options are A. Elective, B. Emergency, C. Urgent. So 'a' corresponds to Elective. 

Are there any other respondents with Blood Type AB+ and Age 37? Let me check the others. 

Respondent 77: Age 59, Blood Type 'b' (A-). Not a match. 

Respondent 130: Age 30, Blood Type 'g' (O+). 

Respondent 51: Age 49, Blood Type 'e' (B+). 

Respondent 96: Age 18, Blood Type 'a' (A+). 

Respondent 42: Age 76, Blood Type 'g' (O+). 

So only Respondent 40 matches both criteria. Therefore, their Admission Type is Elective.

What is the billing amount of the respondent 126?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question. The task is to find the billing amount of respondent 126.

First, I need to look at the data provided. The responses section lists several respondents, each with their details. I should locate Respondent 126 specifically.

Looking through the list, there's Respondent 83, 126, 5, 29, and 93. So Respondent 126 is there. Let me check their details.

Under Respondent 126, the entries are:
- Age: 20
- Gender: b
- Blood Type: g
- Medical Condition: a
- Date of Admission: 2021-01-03
- Doctor: DOC_126
- Hospital: HOSP_126

- Billing Amount: 33682
- Room Number: 321
- Admission Type: b
- Discharge Date: 2020-12-08
- Medication: b
- Test Results: a

The question asks for the billing amount. The Billing Amount field is an open-ended question, so according to the output rules, I should provide the exact text value. For Respondent 126, the Billing Amount is 33682. 

I don't need to convert any codes here because it's an open-ended response. Just report the number as it is. Let me double-check to make sure I didn't mix up any other respondents. Yes, Respondent 126's billing amount is definitely 33682. No other steps needed here.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the hospital of the respondent 62?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question. The task is to find the hospital of respondent 62.

First, I need to look at the data provided. The user mentioned the Survey Data with questions and responses. The responses section lists various respondents, each with their details. 

Looking at the list of respondents, I need to find Respondent 62. Let me scan through each entry. Here's Respondent 62's data:

Respondent 62:
  Age: 27
  Gender: b
  Blood Type: g
  Medical Condition: c
  Date of Admission: 2024-02-22
  Doctor: DOC_62
  Hospital: HOSP_62
  Insurance Provider: d
  Billing Amount: 44437
  Room Number: 376
  Admission Type: a
  Discharge Date: 2024-02-04
  Medication: b
  Test Results: a

The question asks for the hospital. Under the Hospital field for Respondent 62, it says HOSP_62. Since the Hospital question is an open-ended type (as per the questions section: ""7. Hospital: What is your hospital? [Open-ended]""), the answer should be the exact text provided. 

No need to convert any codes here because it's open-ended. So the answer is HOSP_62.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the admission type of the patient with billing amount = '32562' and date of admission = '2024-03-17'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the admission type of the patient who has a billing amount of 32562 and a date of admission on 2024-03-17. 

First, I need to look through the responses provided for each respondent. Let's go through each one:

Starting with Respondent 122. Their billing amount is 48996, which doesn't match 32562. Also, the date of admission is 2021-12-26. So this isn't the one.

Next is Respondent 141. Billing amount is 46378, not matching. Date of admission is 2020-10-26. Not the right one either.

Respondent 43 has a billing amount of 10710. Still not matching. Date of admission is 2022-11-05. Nope.

Respondent 68's billing is 19183. Doesn't match. Date is 2022-08-22. Not the one.

Respondent 136: Billing amount 4398. Not 32562. Date is 2023-06-25. Not matching.

Respondent 109's billing is 35522. Closer but still not the right number. Date is 2022-05-13. Not the date we need.

Now, Respondent 55. Let's check their details. Billing Amount is 32562. That's exactly the number we're looking for. Date of Admission is 2024-03-17, which matches the question. So this is the correct respondent. 

Now, looking at their Admission Type. The response is 'b'. According to the questions section, Admission Type is an MCQ with options A. Elective, B. Emergency, C. Urgent. So 'b' corresponds to Emergency. But wait, the answer format says to output the text, not the letter. So the admission type here is Emergency. 

Wait, but the example given in the problem had an answer of 57, which was a number. But in this case, the answer should be the admission type text. Let me double-check. The task is asking for the admission type, which is an MCQ. So the answer should be the text corresponding to the code. 

Yes, so for Respondent 55, Admission Type is 'b', which maps to Emergency. Therefore, the answer is Emergency.

</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question. The task is to find the medical condition of Respondent 80.

First, I need to look at the data provided. The questions section tells me that question 4 is about Medical Condition, which is a multiple-choice question (MCQ) with options A to F. The options are: A. Arthritis, B. Asthma, C. Cancer, D. Diabetes, E. Hypertension, F. Obesity.

Now, looking at the responses for Respondent 80, under Medical Condition, it says 'c'. According to the MCQ options, option C corresponds to Cancer. So, the medical condition should be Cancer. I need to make sure there's no confusion with uppercase or lowercase letters, but the response uses lowercase 'c', and the options are case-insensitive as per the instructions. Therefore, the answer is Cancer.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the hospital of the respondent 87?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question. The task is to find the hospital of respondent 87.

First, I need to look at the data provided. The responses section lists several respondents, each with their details. I should locate respondent 87 in the list.

Looking through the respondents, I see Respondent 17, 87, 6, 142, 59, 57, 2, 19. So Respondent 87 is there. 

Under Respondent 87's details, the ""Hospital"" field is listed as HOSP_87. Since the question is asking for the hospital, and the Hospital question in the schema is an open-ended field (Question 7: What is your hospital? [Open-ended]), the answer should be the exact value provided, which is HOSP_87. 

No need to convert any codes here because it's an open-ended response. Just report the value as is. Let me double-check to make sure I didn't mix up any other fields. Yep, everything else under Respondent 87 is correct. The answer should be HOSP_87.

Respondent 85: Here, the hospital is HOSP_85, and the date of admission is 2022-10-29. That's exactly the criteria we're looking for. The doctor listed here is DOC_85. 

Just to be thorough, check the last respondent, 19: Their hospital is HOSP_19, admission date 2023-01-07. Not matching.

So, the answer should be DOC_85. No need to convert any codes here since Doctor is an open-ended field, so we just take the exact value.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the insurance provider of the respondent 55?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question. The task is to find the insurance provider of respondent 55.

First, I need to look at the data provided. The questions section tells me that question 8 is about the insurance provider, which is a multiple-choice question (MCQ) with options A. Aetna, B. Blue Cross, C. Cigna, D. Medicare, E. UnitedHealthcare. 

Now, I need to check the responses for respondent 55. Let me find respondent 55 in the list. Here they are:

Respondent 55:
  ...
  Insurance Provider: d
  ...

The response for insurance provider is 'd'. According to the MCQ options, D corresponds to Medicare. So, the answer should be Medicare. I need to make sure there's no other respondent 55 and that I'm looking at the correct entry. Also, check if the letter is lowercase, but the options are case-insensitive as per the rules. So 'd' maps to Medicare. No other steps needed here. The answer is straightforward.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the blood type of the respondent 111?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question. The task is to find the blood type of respondent 111.

First, I need to look at the questions section to understand how the blood type is recorded. The Blood Type question is an MCQ with options A. A+, B. A-, C. AB+, D. AB-, E. B+, F. B-, G. O+, H. O-. The responses use letters a to h, case-insensitive. So each letter corresponds to one of these options.

Now, looking at the responses for respondent 111. Under their entry, Blood Type is listed as 'd'. According to the MCQ options, option D is AB-. So the blood type should be AB-.

Wait, let me double-check. The options are in order: A. A+, B. A-, C. AB+, D. AB-, E. B+, F. B-, G. O+, H. O-. So 'd' maps to D, which is AB-. Yes, that's correct. So the answer is AB-.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the blood type of the patient with test results = 'Normal' and room number = '476'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the blood type of a patient who has test results marked as 'Normal' and is in room number 476. 

First, I need to refer to the questions section to understand the structure. The Test Results field is an MCQ with options A. Abnormal, B. Inconclusive, C. Normal. So, if a respondent's Test Results are 'c', that maps to 'Normal'. The Room Number is an open-ended field, so we look for the exact value '476'.

Now, I'll go through each respondent in the responses to check these two criteria. Let's start with Respondent 14. Their Test Results are 'b' (Inconclusive) and Room Number 255. Doesn't match. Next, Respondent 26: Test Results 'a' (Abnormal), Room 241. Nope. Respondent 16: Test Results 'c' (Normal), Room 162. Test results are good, but room number is wrong. 

Respondent 104: Test Results 'b' (Inconclusive), Room 300. Not matching. Respondent 87: Test Results 'c' (Normal), Room 476. Oh, wait! Room 476 and Test Results 'c' which is Normal. Let me confirm. Yes, Respondent 87 has Room Number 476 and Test Results 'c', which translates to 'Normal'. Their Blood Type is 'a', which according to the Blood Type options (A. A+ B. A- C. AB+ D. AB- E. B+ F. B- G. O+ H. O-), 'a' is A+. 

Let me check the rest to ensure there's no other respondent meeting the criteria. Respondent 28: Test Results 'b' (Inconclusive). Respondent 64: Test Results 'a' (Abnormal). Respondent 50: Test Results 'b' (Inconclusive). Respondent 49: Test Results 'c' (Normal) but Room 130. Respondent 138: Test Results 'a' (Abnormal). Respondent 115: Test Results 'c' (Normal), Room 277. Respondent 36: Test Results 'c' (Normal), Room 205. So only Respondent 87 fits both conditions. Therefore, the blood type is A+.

What is the billing amount of the lowest billing patient?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question: ""What is the billing amount of the lowest billing patient?"" 

First, I need to look through the responses and find the billing amounts for each respondent. The billing amount is an open-ended question, so the values are numerical. The task is to find the smallest (lowest) value among them.

Let me go through each respondent one by one:

- Respondent 47: Billing Amount is 25504
- Respondent 72: 30437
- Respondent 119: 6768
- Respondent 64: 45354
- Respondent 20: -503 (Wait, that's a negative number. That's interesting. Maybe a credit or a refund?)
- Respondent 114: 20258
- Respondent 141: 46378
- Respondent 26: 23737
- Respondent 13: 23685
- Respondent 139: 18843
- Respondent 4: 37406

Now, comparing all these numbers. The smallest one here is -503 from Respondent 20. Even though it's negative, the question asks for the lowest billing amount, which would be the minimum value. So -503 is indeed the lowest. 

I should check if there's any other respondent with a lower value, but looking through the list, all others are positive except this one. So the answer should be -503.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the medication of the respondent 125?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question. The task is to find the medication of respondent 125. Let me start by looking at the data provided.

First, I need to check the questions section to understand how the medication field is structured. The medication question is MCQ with options: A. Aspirin, B. Ibuprofen, C. Lipitor, D. Paracetamol, E. Penicillin. So each letter corresponds to one of these medications.

Now, looking at the responses for respondent 125. Under their entry, the Medication is listed as 'e'. According to the MCQ options, 'E' stands for Penicillin. So the answer should be Penicillin. Let me double-check to make sure I didn't mix up any letters. Yes, E is Penicillin. No other respondent 125 details are needed here. The answer is straightforward once the code is mapped correctly.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the gender of the patient with the lowest billing amount among those with discharge date = '2019-12-13'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the gender of the patient with the lowest billing amount among those who were discharged on '2019-12-13'. 

First, I need to look through the responses and filter out all patients whose discharge date is exactly '2019-12-13'. Let me go through each respondent one by one.

Starting with Respondent 16: Their discharge date is 2019-12-13. That's a match. The billing amount here is 36992. Let's note that down. The gender is 'a', which according to the questions section, the gender options are A. Female and B. Male. So 'a' maps to Female.

Next, check the other respondents. Respondent 43's discharge date is 2023-04-21, so no. Respondent 98's is 2021-03-11. Respondent 1's is 2023-09-23. Respondent 100's is 2023-08-25. Respondent 68's is 2022-09-18. Respondent 117's is 2021-07-31. Respondent 74's is 2021-06-03. Respondent 109's is 2022-06-10. Respondent 143's is 2022-09-27. Respondent 125's is 2020-02-12. 

So only Respondent 16 has the discharge date of 2019-12-13. Now, since there's only one patient in that discharge date, the lowest billing amount is automatically 36992, and their gender is Female. 

Wait, but the question says ""the lowest billing amount among those with discharge date..."". If there were multiple patients with that discharge date, we'd compare their billing amounts. But in this case, there's only one. So the answer is Female.

<task>
What is the billing amount of the patient with medical condition = 'Asthma' and blood type = 'B-'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the billing amount of the patient who has a medical condition of 'Asthma' and a blood type of 'B-'. 

First, I need to refer back to the questions section to understand the MCQ options. For medical condition, the options are A. Arthritis, B. Asthma, C. Cancer, D. Diabetes, E. Hypertension, F. Obesity. So 'Asthma' corresponds to option B. For blood type, the options are A. A+, B. A-, C. AB+, D. AB-, E. B+, F. B-, G. O+, H. O-. Therefore, 'B-' is option F.

Now, I'll go through each respondent in the responses to check if their medical condition is B (Asthma) and blood type is F (B-).

Looking at Respondent 49: Medical Condition is 'a' (Arthritis), Blood Type 'g' (O+). Not matching.

Respondent 76: Medical Condition 'e' (Hypertension), Blood Type 'b' (A-). Not a match.

Respondent 56: Medical Condition 'f' (Obesity), Blood Type 'c' (AB+). No.

Respondent 15: Medical Condition 'a' (Arthritis), Blood Type 'e' (B+). Not it.

Respondent 149: Medical Condition 'f' (Obesity), Blood Type 'a' (A+). Doesn't fit.

Respondent 139: Medical Condition 'b' (Asthma), Blood Type 'f' (B-). Oh, here we go. Their billing amount is 18843.

Respondent 16: Medical Condition 'e' (Hypertension), Blood Type 'a' (A+). Not matching.

So the only respondent that meets both conditions is Respondent 139, and their billing amount is 18843. I need to make sure that the output is just the number as per the rules. No other formatting needed.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the admission type of the patient with the lowest billing amount among those with medication = 'Ibuprofen'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the admission type of the patient with the lowest billing amount among those who are taking Ibuprofen. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The questions section tells me that ""Medication"" is an MCQ with options A to E. The options are Aspirin, Ibuprofen, Lipitor, Paracetamol, and Penicillin. So, when looking for patients with medication 'Ibuprofen', I need to check the Medication field in the responses where the answer is 'b' (since B corresponds to Ibuprofen).

Next, I need to look at each respondent's data. Let's go through each one:

- **Respondent 15**: Medication is 'd', which is Paracetamol. Not Ibuprofen. Skip.
- **Respondent 13**: Medication is 'a' (Aspirin). Not Ibuprofen. Skip.
- **Respondent 150**: Medication is 'd' (Paracetamol). Skip.
- **Respondent 123**: Medication is 'e' (Penicillin). Skip.
- **Respondent 129**: Medication is 'b' (Ibuprofen). Billing amount is 30358. Note this.
- **Respondent 136**: Medication is 'b' (Ibuprofen). Billing amount is 4398. This is lower than 30358.
- **Respondent 41**: Medication is 'd' (Paracetamol). Skip.
- **Respondent 131**: Medication is 'b' (Ibuprofen). Billing amount is 14238. Higher than 4398.
- **Respondent 21**: Medication is 'e' (Penicillin). Skip.
- **Respondent 48**: Medication is 'e' (Penicillin). Skip.

So, the patients on Ibuprofen are Respondents 129, 136, and 131. Their billing amounts are 30358, 4398, and 14238 respectively. The lowest is 4398 (Respondent 136).

Now, check the Admission Type for Respondent 136. The Admission Type field is 'c'. Looking back at the questions, Admission Type options are A. Elective, B. Emergency, C. Urgent. So 'c' maps to Urgent.

Therefore, the admission type is Urgent.

<task>
What is the test results of the patient with insurance provider = 'Cigna' and blood type = 'A+'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the test results of a patient who has an insurance provider of 'Cigna' and a blood type of 'A+'. 

First, I need to refer to the data provided. Let's start by understanding the schema for the relevant fields. 

Looking at the questions section:

- Insurance Provider is an MCQ with options A. Aetna, B. Blue Cross, C. Cigna, D. Medicare, E. UnitedHealthcare. So, if a response has 'c' for Insurance Provider, that maps to Cigna.

- Blood Type is an MCQ with options A. A+, B. A-, C. AB+, D. AB-, E. B+, F. B-, G. O+, H. O-. So, blood type 'a' would be A+.

Now, I need to check each respondent's data to see if they have both Insurance Provider as 'Cigna' (code 'c') and Blood Type as 'A+' (code 'a').

Let's go through each respondent:

Respondent 18:
- Insurance Provider: b (Blue Cross)
- Blood Type: e (B+)
- Doesn't match both criteria.

Respondent 61:
- Insurance Provider: c (Cigna)
- Blood Type: e (B+)
- Insurance matches, but blood type is B+, not A+. So no.

Respondent 104:
- Insurance Provider: c (Cigna)
- Blood Type: b (A-)
- Insurance is Cigna, but blood type is A-, not A+. Doesn't match.

Respondent 31:
- Insurance Provider: d (Medicare)
- Blood Type: h (O-)
- Doesn't match.

Respondent 146:
- Insurance Provider: c (Cigna)
- Blood Type: f (B-)
- Insurance is Cigna, but blood type is B-. Not matching.

Respondent 64:
- Insurance Provider: c (Cigna)
- Blood Type: a (A+)
- Here, Insurance is Cigna (code c) and Blood Type is A+ (code a). This matches both criteria. Now, check the Test Results for this respondent.

Test Results for Respondent 64: a. The Test Results options are A. Abnormal, B. Inconclusive, C. Normal. So 'a' maps to Abnormal.

Therefore, the test result is Abnormal.

<task>
What is the age of the patient with the lowest age among those with hospital = 'HOSP_108'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question. The task is to find the age of the patient with the lowest age among those who are in hospital 'HOSP_108'. 

First, I need to look through the responses to identify all respondents who have their hospital listed as 'HOSP_108'. Let me check each respondent one by one.

Looking at Respondent 21: Hospital is HOSP_21. Not HOSP_108. So skip.
Respondent 108: Hospital is HOSP_108. That's a match. Their age is 63.
Respondent 150: Hospital is HOSP_150. Not a match.
Respondent 145: HOSP_145. Nope.
Respondent 134: HOSP_134. Also not.

So only Respondent 108 is in HOSP_108. Their age is 63. Since there's only one patient in that hospital, the lowest age is 63. But wait, maybe I should check if there are more respondents in HOSP_108 that I might have missed. The data provided only has five respondents, and only Respondent 108 is in HOSP_108. Therefore, the answer is 63.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the discharge date of the patient with the lowest age among those with gender = 'Male'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the discharge date of the patient with the lowest age among those who are male. 

First, I need to identify all male respondents. Looking at the Gender question in the schema, the options are A. Female and B. Male. So, in the responses, any respondent with Gender 'b' is male.

Now, I'll go through each respondent and check their gender. Let's list them out:

- Respondent 67: Gender is 'a' → Female. Skip.
- Respondent 53: Gender 'b' → Male. Age 38.
- Respondent 81: Gender 'a' → Female. Skip.
- Respondent 62: Gender 'b' → Male. Age 27.
- Respondent 68: Gender 'a' → Female. Skip.
- Respondent 102: Gender 'b' → Male. Age 59.
- Respondent 34: Gender 'a' → Female. Skip.
- Respondent 77: Gender 'b' → Male. Age 59.
- Respondent 118: Gender 'a' → Female. Skip.
- Respondent 19: Gender 'a' → Female. Skip.

So the male respondents are 53, 62, 102, 77. Their ages are 38, 27, 59, 59. The lowest age here is 27, which is Respondent 62. 

Now, check Respondent 62's discharge date. Looking at their data: Discharge Date is 2024-02-04. 

Wait, but I need to make sure there's no other male with a lower age. Let me double-check. The ages are 38, 27, 59, 59. The youngest is 27. So yes, Respondent 62 is the correct one. 

Therefore, the discharge date is 2024-02-04.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the medication of the patient with the highest billing amount among those with room number = '144'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the medication of the patient with the highest billing amount among those who have room number 144. 

First, I need to look through the responses and filter out all the respondents who have room number '144'. Let's check each respondent one by one.

Starting with Respondent 118: Their room number is 212. Not 144, so skip.

Respondent 145: Room number is 144. That's a match. Their billing amount is 46430. Let's note that down. Medication here is 'e'. Looking at the medication options in the questions, option E is Penicillin. So their medication is Penicillin.

Next, Respondent 26: Room number 241. Not 144. Skip.

Respondent 19: Room number 333. Not 144. Skip.

Respondent 138: Room number 133. Not 144. 

So only Respondent 145 has room number 144. Since there's only one such respondent, they automatically have the highest billing amount in that group. Therefore, their medication is Penicillin.

What is the discharge date of the respondent 63?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question. The task is to find the discharge date of respondent 63.

First, I need to locate respondent 63 in the provided data. Let me go through the responses section. 

Looking at the list of respondents, I see entries for 130, 68, 34, 90, 18, 63, 95, and 73. There's a Respondent 63. Let me check their details.

Under Respondent 63, the entries are:
- Age: 43
- Gender: b
- Blood Type: d
- Medical Condition: c
- Date of Admission: 2023-06-28
- Doctor: DOC_63
- Hospital: HOSP_63

- Billing Amount: 19973
- Room Number: 451
- Admission Type: a
- Discharge Date: 2023-06-10
- Medication: b
- Test Results: c

The question asks for the discharge date. The discharge date is an open-ended field, so according to the output rules, I should output the exact text value provided. 

Looking at the Discharge Date for respondent 63, it's listed as 2023-06-10. There's no need to convert any codes here since it's an open-ended response. 

I should double-check to make sure I didn't mix up any other respondents. Let me confirm again: Respondent 63's discharge date is 2023-06-10. No other details here seem relevant. The answer should be straightforward.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the medication of the lowest patient with admission type = 'Elective' and medical condition = 'Cancer'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the medication of the lowest patient with admission type 'Elective' and medical condition 'Cancer'. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The questions section defines each field. For example, Admission Type is an MCQ with options A. Elective, B. Emergency, C. Urgent. Similarly, Medical Condition has options including C. Cancer. Medication options are A. Aspirin, B. Ibuprofen, etc.

Now, looking at the responses, I need to filter the respondents who meet the criteria: Admission Type 'Elective' (which is option A) and Medical Condition 'Cancer' (option C). Then, among those, find the one with the lowest age and report their medication.

Let's go through each respondent:

- **Respondent 113**: Admission Type is 'a' (Elective), Medical Condition is 'e' (Hypertension). Doesn't match Cancer.
- **Respondent 140**: Admission Type 'a' (Elective), Medical Condition 'c' (Cancer). Age 49. Medication 'e' which maps to Penicillin.
- **Respondent 78**: Admission Type 'c' (Urgent). Not Elective.
- **Respondent 136**: Admission Type 'c' (Urgent). Not Elective.
- **Respondent 3**: Admission Type 'c' (Urgent). Not Elective.
- **Respondent 142**: Admission Type 'a' (Elective), Medical Condition 'b' (Asthma). Not Cancer.
- **Respondent 77**: Admission Type 'b' (Emergency). Not Elective.

Only Respondent 140 meets both criteria. Their age is 49, which is the only one in the filtered list, so the lowest age here is 49. The medication for this respondent is 'e', which according to the Medication options is Penicillin.

So the answer should be Penicillin.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the room number of the patient with the lowest age among those with date of admission = '2019-11-06'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the room number of the patient with the lowest age who was admitted on '2019-11-06'. 

First, I need to look through the responses to identify all patients with the date of admission as '2019-11-06'. Let me check each respondent's data.

Looking at Respondent 35: Their admission date is 2019-11-21, so that's not it. Respondent 68's admission is in 2022. Respondent 30's is 2023. Respondent 28's admission date is 2019-11-05. Respondent 142: Here we go, their date of admission is 2019-11-06. Respondent 40's admission is in 2020. So only Respondent 142 matches the admission date.

Now, among these, since there's only one patient admitted on that date, their age is 37. But wait, the question asks for the lowest age among them. Since there's only one, the room number would be 482, which is Respondent 142's room number. 

Wait, but let me double-check if there are any other respondents with the same admission date. Scanning again: Respondent 28 is 2019-11-05, Respondent 35 is 2019-11-21. No others. So the answer is 482.

<task>
What is the gender of the patient with the highest age among those with blood type = 'B+'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the gender of the patient with the highest age among those who have blood type 'B+'. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The questions section tells me that blood type is an MCQ with options A. A+, B. A-, etc. So, blood type 'B+' corresponds to option E. Because in the responses, the Blood Type field uses letters, so I need to map 'E' to B+.

Now, looking at the responses, I need to filter all respondents with Blood Type 'E'. Let's go through each respondent:

- Respondent 73: Blood Type h → H. O- (not B+)
- Respondent 54: Blood Type a → A+ (not B+)
- Respondent 88: Blood Type a → A+ (no)
- Respondent 53: Blood Type a → A+ (no)
- Respondent 68: Blood Type g → O+ (no)
- Respondent 130: Blood Type g → O+ (no)
- Respondent 126: Blood Type g → O+ (no)
- Respondent 65: Blood Type g → O+ (no)
- Respondent 14: Blood Type e → B+ (yes)

So only Respondent 14 has blood type B+. Now, check their age: 85. Since this is the only respondent with B+, the highest age in this group is 85. Now, their gender is 'a', which according to the Gender question (A. Female, B. Male), 'a' is Female. 

Therefore, the answer should be Female.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the admission type of the patient with the highest billing amount among those with room number = '302'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the admission type of the patient with the highest billing amount among those in room number 302. 

First, I need to look through the responses and filter out all the patients who have room number 302. Let me check each respondent's data.

Looking at Respondent 109: Room Number is 213. Not 302. Skip.
Respondent 71: Room 212. Nope.
Respondent 12: Room 428. Not it.
Respondent 1: Room 418. No.
Respondent 86: Room 302. Okay, this one matches. Their billing amount is 21784.
Respondent 34: Room 410. Not matching.

So, only Respondent 86 is in room 302. Now, check their billing amount. It's 21784. Since there's only one patient in room 302, they automatically have the highest billing amount in that room. 

Now, look at their Admission Type. The Admission Type for Respondent 86 is 'a'. According to the questions section, Admission Type options are A. Elective, B. Emergency, C. Urgent. So 'a' maps to Elective. 

Therefore, the admission type is Elective.

<task>
What is the hospital of the patient with doctor = 'DOC_03' and blood type = 'B-'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the hospital of the patient who has a doctor named 'DOC_03' and a blood type of 'B-'. 

First, I need to look at the data provided in the responses. Let's go through each respondent one by one.

Starting with Respondent 42: Their doctor is DOC_42, and blood type is 'g'. According to the questions, blood type options include B- as option F. So 'g' would correspond to O+ or O-? Wait, the blood type options are listed as A. A+, B. A-, C. AB+, D. AB-, E. B+, F. B-, G. O+, H. O-. So 'g' is O+. So this isn't B-, so we can skip this one.

Next, Respondent 114: Doctor is DOC_114, blood type 'd' which is AB-. Not B-, so no.

Respondent 142: Doctor is DOC_142, blood type 'g' again (O+). Not relevant.

Respondent 110: Doctor is DOC_110, blood type 'e' which is B+. Close, but not B-.

Respondent 144: Doctor is DOC_144, blood type 'a' (A+). Not matching.

Respondent 3: Here, the doctor is DOC_03. Let's check the blood type. The blood type is 'f'. Looking back at the options, F is B-. So blood type 'f' is B-. That matches both conditions: doctor is DOC_03 and blood type B-. So the hospital for Respondent 3 is HOSP_03. 

Let me check the other respondents to be thorough. Respondent 29: Doctor is DOC_29, blood type 'd' (AB-). No. Respondent 20: DOC_20, blood type 'b' (A-). No. Respondent 39: DOC_39, blood type 'd' (AB-). So only Respondent 3 meets both criteria. Therefore, the hospital is HOSP_03.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the test results of the patient with the highest billing amount among those with admission type = 'Urgent'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the test results of the patient with the highest billing amount among those with an admission type of 'Urgent'. 

First, I need to understand the data provided. The questions section tells me that Admission Type is an MCQ with options A. Elective, B. Emergency, C. Urgent. So, in the responses, if someone has Admission Type 'c', that maps to 'Urgent'. 

Looking at the responses, I need to filter out all respondents whose Admission Type is 'Urgent'. Let's check each respondent:

- Respondent 95: Admission Type is 'a' → Elective. Not Urgent.
- Respondent 150: Admission Type 'a' → Elective. Not Urgent.
- Respondent 142: Admission Type 'a' → Elective. Not Urgent.
- Respondent 38: Admission Type 'c' → Urgent. This one qualifies.
- Respondent 111: Admission Type 'b' → Emergency. Not Urgent.

So only Respondent 38 has an Admission Type of Urgent. Now, among this group (which is just one person here), we need to find the one with the highest billing amount. Since there's only one, their billing amount is 8409. 

Now, check the Test Results for Respondent 38. The Test Results field is an MCQ with options A. Abnormal, B. Inconclusive, C. Normal. Respondent 38's Test Results is 'b', which maps to Inconclusive. 

Therefore, the answer should be 'Inconclusive'.

<task>
What is the medical condition of the patient with the highest billing amount among those with hospital = 'HOSP_27'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the medical condition of the patient with the highest billing amount at HOSP_27. 

First, I need to look through all the respondents and filter out those who have the hospital listed as HOSP_27. Let me check each respondent's hospital entry.

Looking at Respondent 11: Hospital is HOSP_11. Not the one we need.
Respondent 79: HOSP_79. Nope.
Respondent 94: HOSP_94. Still not.
Respondent 92: HOSP_92. No.
Respondent 54: HOSP_54. Not it.
Respondent 64: HOSP_64. No.
Respondent 27: Hospital is HOSP_27. Yes, this is the one we need.

Now, among the patients at HOSP_27, we need to check their billing amounts. But wait, in the data provided, only Respondent 27 is in HOSP_27. Let me confirm again. The responses list includes Respondent 27 with Hospital: HOSP_27. The other respondents are in different hospitals. So there's only one patient in HOSP_27 here.

Since there's only one patient in HOSP_27, their medical condition is the answer. The medical condition for Respondent 27 is listed as 'a'. Looking back at the questions, the Medical Condition options are A. Arthritis, B. Asthma, C. Cancer, D. Diabetes, E. Hypertension, F. Obesity. So 'a' corresponds to Arthritis. 

But wait, the question says ""the patient with the highest billing amount among those with hospital = 'HOSP_27'"". If there's only one patient, then their billing amount is automatically the highest. The billing amount for Respondent 27 is 30591. 

So the medical condition is Arthritis. Let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss any other respondents in HOSP_27. Scanning through all the responses again, no other entries have HOSP_27. Therefore, the answer should be Arthritis.

<task>
What is the blood type of the patient whose billing amount is the highest above the average billing amount for all patients with gender = 'Female' in this case?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the blood type of the patient with the highest billing amount above the average for all female patients. 

First, I need to identify all female patients. The gender question in the schema is MCQ with options A. Female and B. Male. So, looking at the responses, any respondent with Gender: a is female. Let me go through each respondent:

- Respondent 144: Gender a → Female
- Respondent 40: Gender a → Female
- Respondent 42: Gender a → Female
- Respondent 46: Gender a → Female
- Respondent 86: Gender a → Female
- Respondent 64: Gender a → Female

So there are 6 female patients. Now, I need to collect their billing amounts. Let's list them:

- Respondent 144: 16320
- Respondent 40: 17696
- Respondent 42: 14362
- Respondent 46: 42697
- Respondent 86: 21784
- Respondent 64: 45354

Next, calculate the average billing amount for these females. Sum all these amounts and divide by 6.

Sum = 16320 + 17696 + 14362 + 42697 + 21784 + 45354

Let me add them step by step:

16320 + 17696 = 34016

34016 + 14362 = 48378

48378 + 42697 = 91075

91075 + 21784 = 112,859

112,859 + 45,354 = 158,213

Average = 158,213 / 6 ≈ 26,368.83

Now, find each female's billing amount and see how much they are above this average. Let's compute the difference for each:

- Respondent 144: 16,320 - 26,368.83 = -10,048.83 (below average)
- Respondent 40: 17,696 - 26,368.83 = -8,672.83 (below)
- Respondent 42: 14,362 - 26,368.83 = -12,006.83 (below)
- Respondent 46: 42,697 - 26,368.83 = +16,328.17
- Respondent 86: 21,784 - 26,368.83 = -4,584.83 (below)
- Respondent 64: 45,354 - 26,368.83 = +18,985.17

The highest amount above average is Respondent 64 with 45,354, which is 18,985.17 above average. Now, check the blood type for Respondent 64. 

Looking at their data: Blood Type is 'a'. The blood type options are A. A+, B. A-, etc. So 'a' corresponds to A+. Therefore, the answer should be A+.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the admission type of the patient with the highest age among those with insurance provider = 'Blue Cross'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the admission type of the patient with the highest age who has an insurance provider of 'Blue Cross'. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The questions section tells me that Insurance Provider is an MCQ with options A. Aetna, B. Blue Cross, C. Cigna, D. Medicare, E. UnitedHealthcare. So, in the responses, if someone has Insurance Provider 'b', that maps to Blue Cross.

Next, I need to look through all the respondents and filter out those with Insurance Provider 'b'. Let's check each respondent:

- Respondent 41: Insurance Provider is 'd' → Medicare. Not Blue Cross.
- Respondent 28: 'a' → Aetna. No.
- Respondent 98: 'e' → UnitedHealthcare. No.
- Respondent 10: 'c' → Cigna. No.
- Respondent 121: 'c' → Cigna. No.
- Respondent 57: 'd' → Medicare. No.
- Respondent 52: 'b' → Blue Cross. Yes. Age is 26.
- Respondent 118: 'a' → Aetna. No.
- Respondent 90: 'a' → Aetna. No.

So only Respondent 52 has Insurance Provider 'Blue Cross'. Now, check their age: 26. But wait, is there any other respondent with Insurance Provider 'b'? Let me double-check. The list above shows only Respondent 52. 

Now, since there's only one patient with Blue Cross, their age is 26. But the question asks for the admission type of the patient with the highest age among them. Since there's only one, the highest age is 26. 

Now, look at Respondent 52's Admission Type. The Admission Type options are A. Elective, B. Emergency, C. Urgent. Respondent 52's Admission Type is 'a', which maps to Elective. 

Therefore, the answer should be Elective.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the age of the patient whose age is the highest above the average age for all patients with insurance provider = 'Medicare' in this case?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the age of the patient who has the highest age above the average age of all patients with the insurance provider 'Medicare'. 

First, I need to identify which respondents have Medicare as their insurance provider. Looking at the Insurance Provider question, the options are A. Aetna, B. Blue Cross, C. Cigna, D. Medicare, E. UnitedHealthcare. So, in the responses, the Insurance Provider code 'd' corresponds to Medicare.

Now, I'll go through each respondent and check their Insurance Provider. Let's list them out:

- Respondent 59: Insurance Provider is 'e' → UnitedHealthcare. Not Medicare.
- Respondent 58: 'c' → Cigna. Not Medicare.
- Respondent 7: 'c' → Cigna. Not Medicare.
- Respondent 50: 'a' → Aetna. Not Medicare.
- Respondent 103: 'd' → Medicare. So this one is included.
- Respondent 85: 'd' → Medicare. Included.
- Respondent 72: 'd' → Medicare. Included.
- Respondent 18: 'b' → Blue Cross. Not Medicare.
- Respondent 90: 'a' → Aetna. Not Medicare.

So the Medicare patients are Respondents 103, 85, and 72.

Next, I need to calculate their ages and find the average. Let's get their ages:

- Respondent 103: Age 81
- Respondent 85: Age 67
- Respondent 72: Age 72

Calculating the average: (81 + 67 + 72) / 3 = (220) /3 ≈ 73.33 years.

Now, we need to find which of these three has an age that is the highest above this average. Let's compute each one's difference from the average:

- 81 - 73.33 = 7.67
- 67 - 73.33 = -6.33 (below average)
- 72 - 73.33 = -1.33 (below average)

The highest above the average is 81, which is 7.67 years above. Therefore, the patient with the highest age above the average is Respondent 103, who is 81 years old. 

So the answer should be 81.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the blood type of the patient whose age is the highest above the average age for all patients with admission type = 'Emergency' in this case?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the blood type of the patient who has the highest age above the average age for all patients with an admission type of 'Emergency'. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The Admission Type is an MCQ where option B is Emergency. So, I need to filter all respondents where Admission Type is 'b' (since the responses use letters, and the options are A. Elective, B. Emergency, C. Urgent). 

Next, I need to calculate the average age of these Emergency admission patients. Then, find the patient whose age is the highest above this average. Finally, report their blood type.

Let me start by identifying all patients with Admission Type 'b' (Emergency). Looking through each respondent:

- Respondent 85: Admission Type is b. Age 67.
- Respondent 30: Admission Type is b. Age 25.
- Respondent 67: Admission Type is b. Age 21.
- Respondent 149: Admission Type is b. Age 63.

Wait, let me check each one again to make sure I don't miss any. 

Looking at each respondent's Admission Type:

- Respondent 138: a (Elective)
- Respondent 85: b (Emergency)
- Respondent 8: a (Elective)
- Respondent 30: b (Emergency)
- Respondent 67: b (Emergency)
- Respondent 46: c (Urgent)
- Respondent 149: b (Emergency)
- Respondent 68: c (Urgent)
- Respondent 10: c (Urgent)
- Respondent 28: c (Urgent)
- Respondent 112: c (Urgent)

So, the Emergency admissions are respondents 85, 30, 67, 149. 

Now, their ages are 67, 25, 21, 63. Let's calculate the average. 

Sum of ages: 67 + 25 + 21 + 63 = 176. Number of patients: 4. Average age = 176 / 4 = 44.

Now, find the age of each patient above the average. 

- 67: 67 - 44 = 23 above average
- 25: 25 -44 = -19 (below)
- 21: 21-44 = -23 (below)
- 63: 63-44 = 19 above

The highest above average is 23 (67 years old). So the patient with the highest age above average is respondent 85. 

Now, check their blood type. Respondent 85's Blood Type is 'g'. Looking at the Blood Type options: A. A+, B. A-, C. AB+, D. AB-, E. B+, F. B-, G. O+, H. O-. So 'g' corresponds to O+. 

Therefore, the blood type is O+.

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the insurance provider of the patient with the lowest age among those with test results = 'Abnormal'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the insurance provider of the patient with the lowest age among those who have test results marked as 'Abnormal'. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The questions section tells me that Test Results are an MCQ with options A. Abnormal, B. Inconclusive, C. Normal. So, in the responses, if a respondent has Test Results as 'a', that maps to 'Abnormal'. 

Next, I need to go through each respondent in the data and check two things: their Test Results and their Age. The goal is to find all respondents with Test Results = 'Abnormal' and then among them, find the one with the lowest age. Once identified, I need to look up their Insurance Provider.

Looking at the responses:

Respondent 81: Test Results is 'a' (Abnormal), Age 42.
Respondent 30: Test Results 'a', Age 25.
Respondent 99: Test Results 'b' (Inconclusive), so skip.
Respondent 148: Test Results 'a', Age 20.
Respondent 49: Test Results 'c' (Normal), skip.
Respondent 12: Test Results 'b', skip.
Respondent 1: Test Results 'a', Age 53.

So the respondents with Abnormal test results are 81, 30, 148, and 1. Their ages are 42, 25, 20, and 53. The youngest among them is 20 years old (Respondent 148). 

Now, check Respondent 148's Insurance Provider. The Insurance Provider field is an MCQ with options A. Aetna, B. Blue Cross, C. Cigna, D. Medicare, E. UnitedHealthcare. Respondent 148's Insurance Provider is 'e', which maps to UnitedHealthcare. 

Therefore, the answer should be UnitedHealthcare.

<task>
What is the age of the patient whose billing amount is the highest above the average billing amount for all patients with blood type = 'AB-' in this case?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the age of the patient whose billing amount is the highest above the average billing amount for all patients with blood type 'AB-'. 

First, I need to identify all patients with blood type 'AB-'. Looking at the questions section, the Blood Type is an MCQ where option D is AB-. So in the responses, any respondent with Blood Type 'd' (case-insensitive) would be AB-.

Checking the responses:
- Respondent 94: Blood Type d → AB-
- Respondent 111: Blood Type d → AB-
- Others: Respondent 18 has e (B+), 85 has g (O+), 81 has h (O-), 32 has a (A+), 77 has b (A-), 130 has g (O+). So only respondents 94 and 111 have AB- blood type.

Next, calculate the average billing amount for these two. Their billing amounts are:
- Respondent 94: 40134
- Respondent 111: 3126

Average = (40134 + 3126) / 2 = 43260 / 2 = 21630.

Now, find how much each of these two is above this average. 
- Respondent 94: 40134 - 21630 = 18504
- Respondent 111: 3126 - 21630 = -18504 (this is below average)

So the highest above average is Respondent 94 with 18,504 over the average. Therefore, the age of this patient is 81.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the admission type of the respondent 98?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question. The task is to find the admission type of respondent 98.

First, I need to look at the data provided for respondent 98. Let me scan through the responses section. Here's respondent 98's entry:

Respondent 98:
  Age: 34
  Gender: a
  Blood Type: e
  Medical Condition: b
  Date of Admission: 2021-04-17
  Doctor: DOC_98
  Hospital: HOSP_98
  Insurance Provider: e
  Billing Amount: 24637
  Room Number: 316
  Admission Type: a
  Discharge Date: 2021-03-11
  Medication: b
  Test Results: c

The question is about the admission type. Looking at the questions section, the Admission Type is an MCQ with options A. Elective, B. Emergency, C. Urgent. 

In the data for respondent 98, the Admission Type is listed as 'a'. According to the schema, 'a' corresponds to Elective. So the admission type should be Elective. 

I need to make sure there's no other respondent 98 or any possible confusion. Checking again, the data for respondent 98 is correctly identified. The answer is Elective.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the medical condition of the patient whose billing amount is the highest above the average billing amount for all patients with medication = 'Aspirin' in this case?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking for the medical condition of the patient who has the highest billing amount above the average for all patients taking Aspirin. 

First, I need to identify all patients who are on Aspirin. Looking at the Medication question in the schema, the options are Aspirin (A), Ibuprofen (B), Lipitor (C), Paracetamol (D), and Penicillin (E). So, in the responses, any patient with Medication 'a' is taking Aspirin.

Now, let's go through each respondent's data to find those with Medication 'a' (Aspirin). 

- Respondent 78: Medication is 'a' → Aspirin. Billing amount is 23068.
- Respondent 74: Medication is 'a' → Aspirin. Billing amount is 40783.
- Respondent 54: Medication is 'a' → Aspirin. Billing amount is 10664.

So, there are three patients on Aspirin. Next, calculate the average billing amount for these three. 

Adding their billing amounts: 23068 + 40783 + 10664 = 74515. The average is 74515 divided by 3, which is approximately 24838.33.

Now, find how much each of these patients' billing amounts are above this average. 

- Respondent 78: 23068 - 24838.33 = -1770.33 (below average)
- Respondent 74: 40783 - 24838.33 = +15944.67 (above average)
- Respondent 54: 10664 - 24838.33 = -14174.33 (below average)

The highest above average is Respondent 74 with 15944.67 over the average. 

Now, check Respondent 74's medical condition. The Medical Condition options are Arthritis (A), Asthma (B), Cancer (C), Diabetes (D), Hypertension (E), Obesity (F). Respondent 74's Medical Condition is 'a', which maps to Arthritis. 

Therefore, the answer should be Arthritis.

<task>
What is the medication of the patient whose age is the highest above the average age for all patients with insurance provider = 'Medicare' in this case?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the medication of the patient who is the oldest above the average age of all patients with insurance provider 'Medicare'. 

First, I need to identify all patients with insurance provider 'Medicare'. Looking at the Insurance Provider question, the options are A. Aetna, B. Blue Cross, C. Cigna, D. Medicare, E. UnitedHealthcare. So, in the responses, the Insurance Provider code 'd' corresponds to Medicare.

Now, let's go through each respondent and check their Insurance Provider. 

- Respondent 149: Insurance Provider is 'd' → Medicare. Age 63.
- Respondent 55: Insurance Provider 'd' → Medicare. Age 30.
- Respondent 73: Insurance Provider 'd' → Medicare. Age 21.
- Any others? Let me check the rest. Respondent 44 has 'c', 131 has 'e', 122 has 'c', 22 has 'a', 132 has 'e', 114 has 'b', 120 has 'a', 83 has 'e', 22 has 'a', 73 again is 'd'. So the Medicare patients are 149, 55, and 73.

Next, calculate the average age of these three. Their ages are 63, 30, and 21. Adding them: 63 + 30 = 93, +21 = 114. Divide by 3: 114 / 3 = 38. So the average age is 38.

Now, find the patient(s) whose age is above this average. The ages are 63 (which is 25 above average), 30 (8 below), and 21 (17 below). Only Respondent 149 is above the average. 

The highest age above average is 63. So we need the medication for Respondent 149. Looking at their data: Medication is 'b'. The Medication options are A. Aspirin, B. Ibuprofen, C. Lipitor, D. Paracetamol, E. Penicillin. So 'b' maps to Ibuprofen. 

Therefore, the answer should be Ibuprofen.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the medication of the patient with the highest billing amount among those with room number = '422'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the medication of the patient with the highest billing amount among those with room number '422'. 

First, I need to look through all the respondents and filter out those who have room number 422. Let me go through each respondent one by one.

Looking at Respondent 24: Room Number is 295. Not 422. Skip.
Respondent 61: Room 478. Nope.
Respondent 80: Room 196. Not it.
Respondent 58: Room 414. Still not.
Respondent 51: Room 275. No.
Respondent 38: Room 422. Oh, here's one. Their billing amount is 8409. Let's note that. Medication is 'd'. According to the questions, medication options are A. Aspirin, B. Ibuprofen, C. Lipitor, D. Paracetamol, E. Penicillin. So 'd' maps to Paracetamol. But I need to check if there are other respondents with room 422 and compare their billing amounts.

Next, Respondent 7: Room 368. Not 422.
Respondent 12: Room 428. No.
Respondent 63: Room 451. Nope.
Respondent 122: Room 104. Not matching.

So the only respondent with room 422 is Respondent 38. Their billing amount is 8409. Since there's only one, they automatically have the highest billing amount in that room. Their medication is Paracetamol. 

Wait, but the question says ""the patient with the highest billing amount among those with room number = '422'"". If there's only one, then that's the answer. So the medication is Paracetamol.
