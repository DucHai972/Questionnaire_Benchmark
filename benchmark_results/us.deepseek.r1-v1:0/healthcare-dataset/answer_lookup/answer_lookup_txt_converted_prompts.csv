</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the billing amount of the patient with blood type = 'AB+' and medical condition = 'Diabetes'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the billing amount of the patient who has blood type 'AB+' and a medical condition of 'Diabetes'. 

First, I need to refer to the questions section to understand the MCQ options. For blood type, the options are A. A+, B. A-, C. AB+, D. AB-, E. B+, F. B-, G. O+, H. O-. So, 'AB+' corresponds to option C. For the medical condition, the options are A. Arthritis, B. Asthma, C. Cancer, D. Diabetes, E. Hypertension, F. Obesity. So, 'Diabetes' is option D.

Now, I'll go through each respondent in the responses to find those with Blood Type 'c' (since C is AB+) and Medical Condition 'd' (Diabetes). 

Looking at Respondent 12: Blood Type is c (AB+), Medical Condition is d (Diabetes). Their billing amount is 45820. 

Checking other respondents: Respondent 50 has Medical Condition d but Blood Type a. Respondent 26 has Medical Condition d and Blood Type c as well. Wait, Respondent 26's Blood Type is c (AB+), Medical Condition d (Diabetes). Their billing amount is 23737. 

Wait, so there are two respondents with AB+ and Diabetes? Let me check again. 

Respondent 12: Blood Type c (AB+), Medical Condition d (Diabetes) → Billing 45820.  
Respondent 26: Blood Type c (AB+), Medical Condition d (Diabetes) → Billing 23737. 

But the question asks for the billing amount. The answer should list both? Wait, but the question is phrased as ""the patient"", implying a single answer. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.

Wait, looking at the data:

Respondent 12:
- Blood Type: c (AB+)
- Medical Condition: d (Diabetes)
- Billing Amount: 45820

Respondent 26:
- Blood Type: c (AB+)
- Medical Condition: d (Diabetes)
- Billing Amount: 23737

So there are two patients matching the criteria. But the question is asking for ""the patient"", which might be a mistake if there are multiple. However, maybe I missed something. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I misread the data. Let me confirm each respondent:

Respondent 12: Blood Type is c (AB+), Medical Condition d (Diabetes). Correct.

Respondent 26: Blood Type is c (AB+), Medical Condition d (Diabetes). Correct.

So both have the required attributes. The question might have intended for one answer, but according to the data, there are two. However, the answer format requires a single value. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the data. Let me check again.

Wait, looking at the data again:

Respondent 12's Medical Condition is d, which is Diabetes. Blood Type c is AB+.

Respondent 26's Medical Condition is d (Diabetes), Blood Type c (AB+). 

So both are correct. Therefore, the billing amounts are 45820 and 23737. But the question is phrased as ""the patient"", which might be an error if there are multiple. However, in the example provided, the answer was a single number. Maybe in this dataset, there's only one such patient. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in reading the data. Let me check again.

Wait, looking at Respondent 12's data:

- Blood Type: c (AB+)
- Medical Condition: d (Diabetes)
- Billing: 45820

Respondent 26:

- Blood Type: c (AB+)
- Medical Condition: d (Diabetes)
- Billing: 23737

So two entries. But the question is asking for ""the billing amount"", which might imply a single answer. This could be a trick question where the answer is both, but the output rules say if it's a list, provide a comma-separated list. However, the example answer was a single number. Wait, the example had a single answer. Let me check if I made a mistake in the data.

Wait, let me check Respondent 26's Medical Condition again. The data says Medical Condition: d. The options for Medical Condition are D. Diabetes. So yes, both 12 and 26 have AB+ and Diabetes. Therefore, the correct answer should be both billing amounts. But the output rules state that if the question asks for a list, provide a comma-separated list. The task here is to find the billing amount(s) of the patient(s) meeting the criteria. Since there are two, the answer should be ""23737, 45820"" or ""45820, 23737"". But I need to check the order. The respondents are listed in the data in the order 148,50,18,12,59,75,21,60,26,98. So Respondent 12 comes before 26. But the order might not matter. However, the output should list both. But the example answer was a single value, but in that case, there was only one matching respondent. Here, there are two. Therefore, the correct answer is both billing amounts. But the user might have intended one. Let me check again if I misread any of the data.

Wait, Respondent 12's Admission Type is b (Emergency?), let me check the Admission Type options. Admission Type is MCQ: A. Elective B. Emergency C. Urgent. So 'b' is Emergency. But the current task is about blood type and medical condition, not admission type. So that's not relevant here. 

So, the answer should be the billing amounts of both patients: 45820 and 23737. But the output format says if the question asks for a list, provide a comma-separated list. The task is asking for ""the billing amount"", which is singular, but there are two patients. Therefore, the answer should list both amounts. However, perhaps I made a mistake in the data. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps Respondent 26's Blood Type is c, which is AB+? Yes. Medical Condition d is Diabetes. So both are correct. Therefore, the answer is two billing amounts. But the example had a single answer. Maybe the user expects both. So the answer is 23737,45820. But the order? The respondents are ordered as 12 and 26. So 12's amount is 45820, 26's is 23737. So the answer would be ""45820, 23737"" or ""23737, 45820"". The output rules say for a list, comma-separated. So the correct answer is both values. But I need to confirm once more.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the blood type of the patient whose billing amount is the highest above the average billing amount for all patients with gender = 'Female' in this case?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the blood type of the patient with the highest billing amount above the average for all female patients. 

First, I need to identify all female patients. The gender question in the schema is MCQ with options A. Female and B. Male. So, looking at the responses, any respondent with Gender: a is female. Let me go through each respondent:

- Respondent 144: Gender a → Female
- Respondent 40: Gender a → Female
- Respondent 42: Gender a → Female
- Respondent 46: Gender a → Female
- Respondent 86: Gender a → Female
- Respondent 64: Gender a → Female

So there are 6 female patients. Now, I need to collect their billing amounts. Let's list them:

- Respondent 144: 16320
- Respondent 40: 17696
- Respondent 42: 14362
- Respondent 46: 42697
- Respondent 86: 21784
- Respondent 64: 45354

Next, calculate the average billing amount for these females. Sum all these amounts and divide by 6.

Sum = 16320 + 17696 + 14362 + 42697 + 21784 + 45354

Let me add them step by step:

16320 + 17696 = 34016

34016 + 14362 = 48378

48378 + 42697 = 91075

91075 + 21784 = 112,859

112,859 + 45,354 = 158,213

Average = 158,213 / 6 ≈ 26,368.83

Now, find each female's billing amount and see how much they are above this average. Let's compute the difference for each:

- Respondent 144: 16,320 - 26,368.83 = -10,048.83 (below average)
- Respondent 40: 17,696 - 26,368.83 = -8,672.83 (below)
- Respondent 42: 14,362 - 26,368.83 = -12,006.83 (below)
- Respondent 46: 42,697 - 26,368.83 = +16,328.17
- Respondent 86: 21,784 - 26,368.83 = -4,584.83 (below)
- Respondent 64: 45,354 - 26,368.83 = +18,985.17

The highest amount above average is Respondent 64 with 45,354, which is 18,985.17 above average. Now, check the blood type for Respondent 64. 

Looking at their data: Blood Type is 'a'. The blood type options are A. A+, B. A-, etc. So 'a' corresponds to A+. Therefore, the answer should be A+.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the age of the patient whose billing amount is the highest above the average billing amount for all patients with blood type = 'AB-' in this case?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the age of the patient whose billing amount is the highest above the average billing amount for all patients with blood type 'AB-'. 

First, I need to identify all patients with blood type 'AB-'. Looking at the questions section, the Blood Type is an MCQ where option D is AB-. So in the responses, any respondent with Blood Type 'd' (case-insensitive) would be AB-.

Checking the responses:
- Respondent 94: Blood Type d → AB-
- Respondent 111: Blood Type d → AB-
- Others: Respondent 18 has e (B+), 85 has g (O+), 81 has h (O-), 32 has a (A+), 77 has b (A-), 130 has g (O+). So only respondents 94 and 111 have AB- blood type.

Next, calculate the average billing amount for these two. Their billing amounts are:
- Respondent 94: 40134
- Respondent 111: 3126

Average = (40134 + 3126) / 2 = 43260 / 2 = 21630.

Now, find how much each of these two is above this average. 
- Respondent 94: 40134 - 21630 = 18504
- Respondent 111: 3126 - 21630 = -18504 (this is below average)

So the highest above average is Respondent 94 with 18,504 over the average. Therefore, the age of this patient is 81.

First, I need to identify all patients who are on Aspirin. Looking at the Medication question in the schema, the options are Aspirin (A), Ibuprofen (B), Lipitor (C), Paracetamol (D), and Penicillin (E). So, in the responses, any patient with Medication 'a' is taking Aspirin.

Now, let's go through each respondent's data to find those with Medication 'a' (Aspirin). 

- Respondent 78: Medication is 'a' → Aspirin. Billing amount is 23068.
- Respondent 74: Medication is 'a' → Aspirin. Billing amount is 40783.
- Respondent 54: Medication is 'a' → Aspirin. Billing amount is 10664.

So, there are three patients on Aspirin. Next, calculate the average billing amount for these three. 

Adding their billing amounts: 23068 + 40783 + 10664 = 74515. The average is 74515 divided by 3, which is approximately 24838.33.

Now, find how much each of these patients' billing amounts are above this average. 

- Respondent 78: 23068 - 24838.33 = -1770.33 (below average)
- Respondent 74: 40783 - 24838.33 = +15944.67 (above average)
- Respondent 54: 10664 - 24838.33 = -14174.33 (below average)

The highest above average is Respondent 74 with 15944.67 over the average. 

Now, check Respondent 74's medical condition. The Medical Condition options are Arthritis (A), Asthma (B), Cancer (C), Diabetes (D), Hypertension (E), Obesity (F). Respondent 74's Medical Condition is 'a', which maps to Arthritis. 

Therefore, the answer should be Arthritis.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the medication of the patient whose age is the highest above the average age for all patients with insurance provider = 'Medicare' in this case?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the medication of the patient who is the oldest above the average age of all patients with insurance provider 'Medicare'. 

First, I need to identify all patients with insurance provider 'Medicare'. Looking at the Insurance Provider question, the options are A. Aetna, B. Blue Cross, C. Cigna, D. Medicare, E. UnitedHealthcare. So, in the responses, the Insurance Provider code 'd' corresponds to Medicare.

Now, let's go through each respondent and check their Insurance Provider. 

- Respondent 149: Insurance Provider is 'd' → Medicare. Age 63.
- Respondent 55: Insurance Provider 'd' → Medicare. Age 30.
- Respondent 73: Insurance Provider 'd' → Medicare. Age 21.
- Any others? Let me check the rest. Respondent 44 has 'c', 131 has 'e', 122 has 'c', 22 has 'a', 132 has 'e', 114 has 'b', 120 has 'a', 83 has 'e', 22 has 'a', 73 again is 'd'. So the Medicare patients are 149, 55, and 73.

Next, calculate the average age of these three. Their ages are 63, 30, and 21. Adding them: 63 + 30 = 93, +21 = 114. Divide by 3: 114 / 3 = 38. So the average age is 38.

Now, find the patient(s) whose age is above this average. The ages are 63 (which is 25 above average), 30 (8 below), and 21 (17 below). Only Respondent 149 is above the average. 

The highest age above average is 63. So we need the medication for Respondent 149. Looking at their data: Medication is 'b'. The Medication options are A. Aspirin, B. Ibuprofen, C. Lipitor, D. Paracetamol, E. Penicillin. So 'b' maps to Ibuprofen. 

Therefore, the answer should be Ibuprofen.
