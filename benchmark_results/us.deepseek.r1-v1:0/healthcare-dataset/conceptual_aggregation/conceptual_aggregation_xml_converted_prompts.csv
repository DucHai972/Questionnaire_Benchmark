<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents have Gender = 'Female' and Insurance Provider = 'Cigna'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking how many respondents have Gender as 'Female' and Insurance Provider as 'Cigna'. 

First, I need to refer to the questions section to understand the mapping of the MCQ options. For Gender, the options are A. Female and B. Male. So, if a respondent's answer is 'a', that corresponds to Female. For Insurance Provider, the options are A. Aetna, B. Blue Cross, C. Cigna, D. Medicare, E. UnitedHealthcare. So, the code 'c' would map to Cigna.

Now, I need to go through each respondent in the responses section and check two things: their Gender answer and their Insurance Provider answer. 

Looking at respondent 18: Gender is 'b' (Male), Insurance Provider is 'b' (Blue Cross). Doesn't match.

Respondent 61: Gender is 'b' (Male), Insurance Provider is 'c' (Cigna). So Gender is Male, which doesn't meet the Female requirement.

Respondent 74: Gender 'b' (Male), Insurance Provider 'e' (UnitedHealthcare). Not a match.

Respondent 59: Gender 'a' (Female), Insurance Provider 'e' (UnitedHealthcare). Gender is correct, but Insurance Provider isn't Cigna.

Respondent 24: Gender 'a' (Female), Insurance Provider 'b' (Blue Cross). Again, Gender is Female, but Insurance Provider is Blue Cross, not Cigna.

Wait, are there more respondents? Let me check again. The data provided has five respondents: 18, 61, 74, 59, 24. All of them have been checked. None of the Female respondents (59 and 24) have Insurance Provider as Cigna. The only respondent with Cigna is 61, but they are Male. 

So the count should be zero. But wait, let me double-check. Maybe I missed someone. Let me go through each one again.

Respondent 18: Male, Blue Cross. No.

61: Male, Cigna. No.

74: Male, UnitedHealthcare. No.

59: Female, UnitedHealthcare. No.

24: Female, Blue Cross. No.

Yes, none of the Female respondents have Cigna as their Insurance Provider. So the answer is 0.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the respondents whose Billing Amount is greater than 10000.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem. The task is to count the respondents whose Billing Amount is greater than 10,000. 

First, I need to look at the data provided. The dataset is in XML format, with a list of respondents, each having various answers to questions. The relevant question here is ""Billing Amount"", which is an open-ended question, so the answers should be numerical values.

I'll start by going through each respondent one by one and check their Billing Amount. Let's list out all the respondents and their billing amounts:

- Respondent 26: 23737
- Respondent 114: 20258
- Respondent 43: 10710
- Respondent 77: 39958
- Respondent 8: 3909
- Respondent 12: 45820
- Respondent 84: 17993
- Respondent 15: 3879
- Respondent 76: 17440
- Respondent 92: 18835
- Respondent 96: 49834

Now, I need to check which of these amounts are greater than 10,000.

Let's go through each:

1. Respondent 26: 23737 > 10000 → Yes
2. Respondent 114: 20258 > 10000 → Yes
3. Respondent 43: 10710 > 10000 → Yes (since 10710 is 10,710)
4. Respondent 77: 39958 → Yes
5. Respondent 8: 3909 → No
6. Respondent 12: 45820 → Yes
7. Respondent 84: 17993 → Yes
8. Respondent 15: 3879 → No
9. Respondent 76: 17440 → Yes
10. Respondent 92: 18835 → Yes
11. Respondent 96: 49834 → Yes

Now, count the ""Yes"" responses. Let's count:

1. 26: Yes (1)
2. 114: Yes (2)
3. 43: Yes (3)
4. 77: Yes (4)
5. 12: Yes (5)
6. 84: Yes (6)
7. 76: Yes (7)
8. 92: Yes (8)
9. 96: Yes (9)

Wait, that's 9 respondents. Let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss any or count incorrectly.

Looking again:

- 26: 23737 → Yes
- 114: 20258 → Yes
- 43: 10710 → Yes
- 77: 39958 → Yes
- 8: 3909 → No
- 12: 45820 → Yes
- 84: 17993 → Yes
- 15: 3879 → No
- 76: 17440 → Yes
- 92: 18835 → Yes
- 96: 49834 → Yes

That's 9 respondents with billing amounts over 10,000. Wait, but when I list them, that's 9 entries. Let me count again:

1. 26
2. 114
3. 43
4. 77
5. 12
6. 84
7. 76
8. 92
9. 96

Yes, 9 in total. But wait, the example given in the problem had an answer of 1 for a different question. But here, the answer is 9. Let me check again to ensure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, the example is for a different question (Gender=Male and Medical Condition=Hypertension), which had an answer of 1. But the current task is about Billing Amount >10,000. So the example's answer isn't related here.

Looking back at the data:

Respondent 43's billing amount is 10710, which is 10,710, so that's over 10,000. Respondent 8 has 3,909 which is under. Respondent 15 has 3,879, also under. The rest of the ones I marked as ""Yes"" are all over 10k. So total of 9. 

Therefore, the answer should be 9.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
How many respondents have a Medication of 'Penicillin'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem. The question is asking how many respondents have a Medication of 'Penicillin'. 

First, I need to look at the structure of the data provided. The dataset has a 'questions' section and a 'responses' section. The Medication question is an MCQ with options A. Aspirin, B. Ibuprofen, C. Lipitor, D. Paracetamol, E. Penicillin. So, the answer codes for Medication would be 'a' to 'e', corresponding to these options.

Now, I need to go through each respondent in the responses and check their Medication answer. The correct code for Penicillin is 'e'. 

Looking at each respondent one by one:

- Respondent 38: Medication is 'd' → Paracetamol. Not Penicillin.
- Respondent 63: Medication is 'b' → Ibuprofen. No.
- Respondent 136: 'b' → Ibuprofen. No.
- Respondent 106: 'c' → Lipitor. No.
- Respondent 145: 'e' → Penicillin. Count 1.
- Respondent 47: 'b' → Ibuprofen. No.
- Respondent 44: 'e' → Penicillin. Count 2.
- Respondent 45: 'a' → Aspirin. No.
- Respondent 21: 'e' → Penicillin. Count 3.
- Respondent 98: 'b' → Ibuprofen. No.
- Respondent 62: 'b' → Ibuprofen. No.

Wait, let me double-check each to make sure I didn't miss any. 

Respondent 145: 'e' → Penicillin. Correct. 
Respondent 44: 'e' → Penicillin. Correct. 
Respondent 21: 'e' → Penicillin. Correct. 

So that's three respondents. Wait, but in the example given earlier, the answer was 1 for a similar question. But in this case, the count seems to be three. Let me check again.

Wait, looking back at the data:

Respondent 44: <answer question=""Medication"">e</answer> → Yes, that's Penicillin.
Respondent 21: <answer question=""Medication"">e</answer> → Penicillin.
Respondent 145: <answer question=""Medication"">e</answer> → Penicillin.

So three respondents. Therefore, the answer should be 3.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents have a Test Results of 'Abnormal'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question. The task is to find out how many respondents have a Test Results of 'Abnormal'. 

First, I need to look at the questions section to understand the structure. The Test Results question is a MCQ with options A. Abnormal, B. Inconclusive, C. Normal. So, the answer codes would be 'a' or 'A' for Abnormal.

Now, I'll go through each respondent in the responses section and check their Test Results answer. 

Starting with respondent 150: Test Results is 'c', which maps to Normal. Not counted.

Respondent 37: Test Results is 'a' → Abnormal. That's one.

Respondent 60: 'c' → Normal. Skip.

Respondent 119: 'a' → Abnormal. Second one.

Respondent 66: 'b' → Inconclusive. No.

Respondent 118: 'c' → Normal. No.

Respondent 3: 'b' → Inconclusive. No.

Respondent 120: 'b' → Inconclusive. No.

Respondent 74: 'a' → Abnormal. Third.

Respondent 140: 'a' → Abnormal. Fourth.

Respondent 41: 'a' → Abnormal. Fifth.

Respondent 19: 'c' → Normal. No.

Wait, let me recount to make sure. 

37: a → 1
119: a → 2
74: a →3
140: a →4
41: a →5

Wait, that's five respondents. But let me check each again to avoid mistakes.

Looking at each one:

- 37: a → Abnormal (1)
- 119: a → Abnormal (2)
- 74: a → Abnormal (3)
- 140: a → Abnormal (4)
- 41: a → Abnormal (5)
- Any others? 

Wait, respondent 3's Test Results is 'b' (Inconclusive), 120 is 'b' (Inconclusive), 19 is 'c' (Normal). The rest are 'c' or 'b'. So total of 5 respondents with 'Abnormal' Test Results. 

But wait, the example given in the problem had an answer of 1, but that was for a different question (Gender=Male and Medical Condition=Hypertension). So in this case, the answer here should be 5. Let me confirm once more.

Yes, respondents 37, 119, 74, 140, 41 all have Test Results 'a' which is Abnormal. That's five. So the answer is 5.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the respondents whose Billing Amount is greater than 40000.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem. The task is to count the number of respondents whose Billing Amount is greater than 40,000. 

First, I need to look at the data provided. The dataset is in XML format, with each respondent having various answers to questions. The relevant question here is ""Billing Amount"", which is an open-ended question, so the answers should be numerical values.

I'll go through each respondent one by one and check their Billing Amount. Let's list them out:

1. Respondent 89: Billing Amount is 32629. That's less than 40k.
2. Respondent 77: 39958. Just under 40k, so no.
3. Respondent 109: 35522. Also under.
4. Respondent 65: 29851. Nope.
5. Respondent 117: 20228. No.
6. Respondent 78: 23068. Still under.
7. Respondent 51: 14300. No.
8. Respondent 99: 2305. Way below.
9. Respondent 124: 46814. This is over 40k. So count 1.
10. Respondent 28: 5767. No.
11. Respondent 61: 23500. No.
12. Respondent 98: 24637. No.

Wait, that's all the respondents. Only respondent 124 has a billing amount of 46,814, which is over 40,000. So the count should be 1. Let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss any others. Scanning through again, yes, only respondent 124 meets the criteria. Therefore, the answer is 1.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
How many respondents have a Test Results of 'Inconclusive'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question. The task is to find out how many respondents have a Test Results of 'Inconclusive'. 

First, I need to look at the questions section to understand the Test Results field. The question for Test Results is a multiple-choice question (MCQ) with options A. Abnormal, B. Inconclusive, C. Normal. So, the corresponding codes are 'a' for Abnormal, 'b' for Inconclusive, and 'c' for Normal.

Now, I need to go through each respondent in the responses section and check their answer for Test Results. The answer will be a lowercase letter, and I need to see if it matches 'b' (Inconclusive).

Let's go through each respondent one by one:

1. Respondent 148: Test Results is 'a' → Abnormal. Not Inconclusive.
2. Respondent 76: Test Results is 'b' → Inconclusive. Count this one.
3. Respondent 6: Test Results is 'b' → Inconclusive. Count this one.
4. Respondent 102: Test Results is 'a' → Abnormal. Not counted.
5. Respondent 71: Test Results is 'c' → Normal. Not counted.
6. Respondent 3: Test Results is 'b' → Inconclusive. Count this one.
7. Respondent 145: Test Results is 'a' → Abnormal. Not counted.
8. Respondent 13: Test Results is 'b' → Inconclusive. Count this one.
9. Respondent 128: Test Results is 'b' → Inconclusive. Count this one.
10. Respondent 74: Test Results is 'a' → Abnormal. Not counted.

Wait, let me recount to make sure I didn't miss any. 

Looking again:

- Respondent 76: 'b' → 1
- Respondent 6: 'b' → 2
- Respondent 3: 'b' → 3
- Respondent 13: 'b' → 4
- Respondent 128: 'b' → 5

Wait, that's five respondents. But let me check each again to confirm.

Respondent 76: 'b' → Inconclusive. Yes.
Respondent 6: 'b' → Inconclusive. Yes.
Respondent 3: 'b' → Inconclusive. Yes.
Respondent 13: 'b' → Inconclusive. Yes.
Respondent 128: 'b' → Inconclusive. Yes.

Wait, that's five. But looking at the data:

Looking at the XML data for each respondent:

- Respondent 76: <answer question=""Test Results"">b</answer> → Inconclusive.
- Respondent 6: <answer question=""Test Results"">b</answer> → Inconclusive.
- Respondent 3: <answer question=""Test Results"">b</answer> → Inconclusive.
- Respondent 13: <answer question=""Test Results"">b</answer> → Inconclusive.
- Respondent 128: <answer question=""Test Results"">b</answer> → Inconclusive.

Wait, that's five. But in the data provided, how many are there? Let me count again from the XML:

Looking at each <respondent>:

1. id=""148"": Test Results a → no
2. id=""76"": Test Results b → yes (1)
3. id=""6"": Test Results b → yes (2)
4. id=""102"": Test Results a → no
5. id=""71"": Test Results c → no
6. id=""3"": Test Results b → yes (3)
7. id=""145"": Test Results a → no
8. id=""13"": Test Results b → yes (4)
9. id=""128"": Test Results b → yes (5)
10. id=""74"": Test Results a → no

So total of 5 respondents have Test Results 'Inconclusive'. But wait, the example given in the problem had an answer of 1, but that was for a different question (Gender=Male and Medical Condition=Hypertension). So in this case, the correct answer here should be 5. But let me double-check to make sure I didn't miscount.

Yes, five respondents: 76, 6, 3, 13, 128. Each has 'b' in Test Results. So the answer is 5.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
How many respondents have a Test Results of 'Inconclusive'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question. The task is to find out how many respondents have a Test Result of 'Inconclusive'. 

First, I need to look at the questions section to understand the Test Results field. The question for Test Results is a MCQ with options A. Abnormal, B. Inconclusive, C. Normal. So the corresponding codes are 'a' for Abnormal, 'b' for Inconclusive, and 'c' for Normal.

Now, I need to go through each respondent in the responses section and check their answer for Test Results. Each respondent has an <answer> element with the question attribute ""Test Results"". The value of that answer is the code (like 'a', 'b', 'c').

Let me list out all the respondents and their Test Results:

- Respondent 91: Test Results is 'c' → Normal
- Respondent 57: Test Results is 'b' → Inconclusive
- Respondent 49: Test Results is 'c' → Normal
- Respondent 65: Test Results is 'c' → Normal
- Respondent 36: Test Results is 'c' → Normal
- Respondent 25: Test Results is 'a' → Abnormal
- Respondent 11: Test Results is 'b' → Inconclusive
- Respondent 80: Test Results is 'c' → Normal

Now, count how many have 'b' (Inconclusive). Looking at the list, respondents 57 and 11 have 'b'. That's two instances. 

Wait, let me double-check. Respondent 57: yes, 'b'. Respondent 11: also 'b'. So that's two. Are there any others? Let me go through each one again to be sure. 

Yes, only 57 and 11. So the total count is 2.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents have a Medication of 'Aspirin'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question. The task is to find out how many respondents have a Medication of 'Aspirin'. 

First, I need to check the schema for the Medication question. Looking at the questions section, the Medication question is an MCQ with options: A. Aspirin, B. Ibuprofen, C. Lipitor, D. Paracetamol, E. Penicillin. So, the answer code for Aspirin is 'A' (case-insensitive).

Now, I need to go through each respondent's answer for the Medication and count how many have 'A' (or 'a') as their answer. Let's go through each respondent one by one.

Respondent 9: Medication is 'c' → Lipitor. Not Aspirin.
Respondent 149: Medication is 'b' → Ibuprofen. No.
Respondent 94: 'e' → Penicillin. No.
Respondent 34: 'd' → Paracetamol. No.
Respondent 24: 'c' → Lipitor. No.
Respondent 76: 'd' → Paracetamol. No.
Respondent 84: 'b' → Ibuprofen. No.
Respondent 107: 'a' → Aspirin. Count 1.
Respondent 45: 'a' → Aspirin. Count 2.
Respondent 52: 'd' → Paracetamol. No.
Respondent 139: 'a' → Aspirin. Count 3.
Respondent 136: 'b' → Ibuprofen. No.

Wait, let me double-check. Respondent 107: Medication is 'a' → Aspirin. Respondent 45: 'a' → Aspirin. Respondent 139: 'a' → Aspirin. That's three respondents. But wait, the example given in the problem had an answer of 1, but that was for a different question. So in this case, the count should be 3. But let me check again to make sure I didn't miss any.

Looking again:

Respondent 107: <answer question=""Medication"">a</answer> → Aspirin. Correct.
Respondent 45: <answer question=""Medication"">a</answer> → Aspirin. Correct.
Respondent 139: <answer question=""Medication"">a</answer> → Aspirin. Correct.

Yes, three respondents. So the answer should be 3.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
How many respondents have Gender = 'Male' and Insurance Provider = 'Medicare'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking for the number of respondents who are Male and have Medicare as their insurance provider. 

First, I need to refer to the questions section to understand the mapping of the MCQ options. 

Looking at the Gender question: [MCQ: A. Female B. Male]. So, 'b' in the responses corresponds to Male.

For Insurance Provider: [MCQ: A. Aetna B. Blue Cross C. Cigna D. Medicare E. UnitedHealthcare]. Here, 'd' would map to Medicare.

Now, I need to go through each respondent in the responses section and check if both their Gender is 'b' (Male) and their Insurance Provider is 'd' (Medicare).

Let's list out the respondents:

- Respondent 43: Gender is 'a' (Female), Insurance 'b' (Blue Cross) → Doesn't match.
- Respondent 66: Gender 'b' (Male), Insurance 'e' (UnitedHealthcare) → Only Gender matches.
- Respondent 124: Gender 'b' (Male), Insurance 'c' (Cigna) → Only Gender matches.
- Respondent 76: Gender 'a' (Female), Insurance 'e' → Doesn't match.
- Respondent 87: Gender 'a', Insurance 'a' → No.
- Respondent 30: Gender 'a', Insurance 'd' (Medicare) → Gender is Female, so no.
- Respondent 120: Gender 'b' (Male), Insurance 'a' (Aetna) → Only Gender.
- Respondent 20: Gender 'a', Insurance 'd' → Female, so no.
- Respondent 37: Gender 'a', Insurance 'e' → No.

Wait, did I miss any? Let me check again. The respondents are 43, 66, 124, 76, 87, 30, 120, 20, 37. 

Looking for those with Gender 'b' (Male) and Insurance 'd' (Medicare). 

From the list:
- Respondent 66: Male, but Insurance is 'e'.
- Respondent 124: Male, Insurance 'c'.
- Respondent 120: Male, Insurance 'a'.
- Any others? No. 

Wait, respondent 30 has Insurance 'd' (Medicare) but Gender 'a' (Female). So no. 

So none of the Male respondents have Medicare as their insurance provider. Therefore, the count is 0.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose Age is greater than 60.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem. The task is to count the number of respondents whose Age is greater than 60. 

First, I need to look at the data provided. The dataset is in XML format, with each respondent under the <responses> section. Each respondent has an <answer> for the ""Age"" question.

I'll go through each respondent one by one and check their age. The Age question is an open-ended field, so the value is a number. 

Looking at the respondents:

1. Respondent 102: Age is 59. That's less than 60, so no.
2. Respondent 143: Age is 80. 80 is greater than 60. Count this one.
3. Respondent 94: Age is 81. Also over 60. Count this.
4. Respondent 24: 31. Under 60. No.
5. Respondent 4: 51. Under. No.
6. Respondent 68: 26. No.
7. Respondent 138: 58. Still under.
8. Respondent 32: 28. No.

So, respondents 143 and 94 are the ones over 60. That's 2 people. Wait, let me double-check. 

143: 80 >60 → yes. 94: 81 → yes. The others are all below. So total of 2. 

Wait, but in the example given earlier, the answer was 1. But in this case, the task is different. The example was about Gender and Medical Condition, but here it's Age. So the answer here should be 2. Let me confirm again.

Yes, 80 and 81 are both over 60. So the count is 2.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents have a Medical Condition of 'Asthma'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question. The task is to find out how many respondents have a Medical Condition of 'Asthma'. 

First, I need to check the schema for the Medical Condition question. Looking at the questions section, the Medical Condition is an MCQ with options: A. Arthritis, B. Asthma, C. Cancer, D. Diabetes, E. Hypertension, F. Obesity. So, the code for Asthma is 'B'.

Now, I need to go through each respondent's answer for the Medical Condition and count how many have 'B' (case-insensitive). Let's look at each respondent one by one.

Respondent 95: Medical Condition is 'e' → Hypertension. Not Asthma.
Respondent 68: 'c' → Cancer. No.
Respondent 150: 'b' → Asthma. Count 1.
Respondent 98: 'b' → Asthma. Count 2.
Respondent 96: 'b' → Asthma. Count 3.
Respondent 28: 'd' → Diabetes. No.
Respondent 60: 'b' → Asthma. Count 4.
Respondent 121: 'e' → Hypertension. No.
Respondent 7: 'd' → Diabetes. No.
Respondent 144: 'c' → Cancer. No.
Respondent 84: 'f' → Obesity. No.
Respondent 57: 'd' → Diabetes. No.

Wait, let me double-check each one to make sure I didn't miss any. 

Looking again:
- Respondent 150: 'b' → Asthma. Yes.
- Respondent 98: 'b' → Asthma. Yes.
- Respondent 96: 'b' → Asthma. Yes.
- Respondent 60: 'b' → Asthma. Yes.

That's four respondents. Hmm, but wait, in the example given earlier, the answer was 1 for Male and Hypertension. Let me confirm again. 

Wait, the current task is Asthma, not Hypertension. So in the data provided, how many have 'b' in Medical Condition. Let me recount:

Looking at all respondents:

1. Respondent 95: e → no
2. 68: c → no
3. 150: b → yes (1)
4. 98: b → yes (2)
5. 96: b → yes (3)
6. 28: d → no
7. 60: b → yes (4)
8. 121: e → no
9. 7: d → no
10. 144: c → no
11. 84: f → no
12. 57: d → no

So total of 4 respondents. But wait, the example had a different count, but that's for a different condition. So the answer here should be 4.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
How many respondents have Gender = 'Male' and Medical Condition = 'Asthma'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find out how many respondents are Male and have Asthma as their medical condition. 

First, I need to look at the questions section to understand the mapping for the MCQ options. For Gender, the options are A. Female and B. Male. So, a response of 'a' would be Female, and 'b' is Male. For Medical Condition, the options are A. Arthritis, B. Asthma, C. Cancer, D. Diabetes, E. Hypertension, F. Obesity. So, the code 'b' corresponds to Asthma.

Now, I need to go through each respondent in the responses section and check both their Gender and Medical Condition answers. Let's list them out:

Respondent 119: Gender is 'a' (Female), Medical Condition 'f' (Obesity). Doesn't match.

Respondent 78: Gender 'b' (Male), Medical Condition 'd' (Diabetes). Not Asthma.

Respondent 105: Gender 'b' (Male), Medical Condition 'c' (Cancer). Still not Asthma.

Respondent 30: Gender 'a' (Female), Medical Condition 'b' (Asthma). Female with Asthma, so doesn't meet both criteria.

Respondent 36: Gender 'b' (Male), Medical Condition 'a' (Arthritis). Male but wrong condition.

Respondent 12: Gender 'b' (Male), Medical Condition 'd' (Diabetes). Again, Male but Diabetes.

Wait, did I miss anyone? Let me check again. All respondents are checked. None of the Male respondents have Medical Condition 'b' (Asthma). The only one with Asthma is respondent 30, but they are Female. So the count should be 0.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents have Gender = 'Female' and Admission Type = 'Urgent'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking how many respondents have Gender as 'Female' and Admission Type as 'Urgent'. 

First, I need to look at the questions section to understand the mapping for the MCQ options. 

For Gender, the question is: ""What is your gender? [MCQ: A. Female B. Male]"". So, the answer 'a' corresponds to Female and 'b' to Male.

For Admission Type, the question is: ""What is your admission type? [MCQ: A. Elective B. Emergency C. Urgent]"". Here, 'a' is Elective, 'b' is Emergency, and 'c' is Urgent.

Now, I need to go through each respondent in the responses section and check if both their Gender is 'a' (Female) and their Admission Type is 'c' (Urgent).

Looking at the respondents one by one:

Respondent 78:
- Gender: 'b' → Male
- Admission Type: 'c' → Urgent
- So, Gender is not Female. Doesn't count.

Respondent 127:
- Gender: 'b' → Male
- Admission Type: 'b' → Emergency
- Doesn't meet either condition. Doesn't count.

Respondent 30:
- Gender: 'a' → Female
- Admission Type: 'b' → Emergency
- Gender is Female, but Admission Type is not Urgent. Doesn't count.

Respondent 25:
- Gender: 'a' → Female
- Admission Type: 'a' → Elective
- Gender is Female, but Admission Type is Elective. Doesn't count.

Respondent 61:
- Gender: 'b' → Male
- Admission Type: 'a' → Elective
- Neither condition met. Doesn't count.

After checking all respondents, none of them have both Gender as Female and Admission Type as Urgent. Wait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss any. 

Looking again at each respondent's Admission Type where Gender is 'a' (Female):

Respondent 30: Admission Type 'b' (Emergency)
Respondent 25: Admission Type 'a' (Elective)

No one with Gender Female has Admission Type 'c' (Urgent). So the count should be 0.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents have Gender = 'Female' and Insurance Provider = 'Medicare'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking how many respondents have Gender as 'Female' and Insurance Provider as 'Medicare'. 

First, I need to look at the schema to understand how the options are mapped. For the Gender question, the options are A. Female and B. Male. So, a response of 'a' would correspond to Female. For the Insurance Provider, the options are A. Aetna, B. Blue Cross, C. Cigna, D. Medicare, E. UnitedHealthcare. So, a response of 'd' would be Medicare.

Now, I need to go through each respondent in the responses section and check these two conditions. Let's list out each respondent:

Respondent 100: Gender is 'a' (Female), Insurance Provider is 'd' (Medicare). So this one meets both conditions. Count = 1.

Respondent 117: Gender is 'a' (Female), Insurance Provider is 'e' (UnitedHealthcare). Doesn't meet the Insurance Provider condition. Count remains 1.

Respondent 95: Gender 'a' (Female), Insurance Provider 'a' (Aetna). Insurance Provider doesn't match. Count still 1.

Respondent 139: Gender is empty. So this one doesn't qualify. No change.

Respondent 108: Gender 'a' (Female), Insurance Provider 'e' (UnitedHealthcare). Doesn't match. Count remains 1.

Respondent 40: Gender 'a' (Female), Insurance Provider 'd' (Medicare). This also meets both conditions. Now count increases to 2.

Respondent 107: Gender 'a' (Female), Insurance Provider 'a' (Aetna). Doesn't match. Final count is 2.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check. Respondent 40: Gender is 'a' which is Female, Insurance Provider 'd' which is Medicare. Yes, that's correct. So that's two respondents: 100 and 40. So the answer should be 2.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents have Gender = 'Female' and Admission Type = 'Emergency'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking how many respondents have Gender as 'Female' and Admission Type as 'Emergency'. 

First, I need to refer to the questions section to understand the mapping of the MCQ options. 

Looking at the Gender question: [MCQ: A. Female B. Male]. So, the code 'a' corresponds to Female and 'b' to Male.

Next, the Admission Type question: [MCQ: A. Elective B. Emergency C. Urgent]. Here, 'b' stands for Emergency.

Now, I need to go through each respondent in the responses section and check if both their Gender is 'a' (Female) and Admission Type is 'b' (Emergency).

Let's check each respondent one by one:

1. Respondent 126: Gender is 'b' (Male), Admission Type 'b' (Emergency). Doesn't meet both conditions.
2. Respondent 105: Gender 'b' (Male), Admission Type 'a' (Elective). No match.
3. Respondent 72: Gender 'a' (Female), Admission Type 'b' (Emergency). This one matches both conditions.
4. Respondent 9: Gender 'a' (Female), Admission Type 'b' (Emergency). Another match.
5. Respondent 95: Gender 'a' (Female), Admission Type 'a' (Elective). Only Gender matches.
6. Respondent 56: Gender 'b' (Male), Admission Type 'c' (Urgent). Doesn't match.

So, respondents 72 and 9 meet both criteria. That's a total of 2.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
How many respondents have a Medical Condition of 'Cancer'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question. The task is to find out how many respondents have a Medical Condition of 'Cancer'. 

First, I need to look at the structure of the data provided. The dataset has a 'questions' section that defines each question, including the Medical Condition. The Medical Condition is a multiple-choice question (MCQ) with options: A. Arthritis, B. Asthma, C. Cancer, D. Diabetes, E. Hypertension, F. Obesity. So, the code for Cancer is 'C'.

Next, I need to go through each respondent in the 'responses' section and check their answer for the Medical Condition. Each respondent has an <answer> element with the question attribute set to ""Medical Condition"". The value there should be the letter corresponding to their condition.

Let me list out all the respondents and their Medical Condition answers:

1. Respondent 114: Medical Condition is 'd' → Diabetes (D is Diabetes)
2. Respondent 61: 'b' → Asthma (B is Asthma)
3. Respondent 93: 'a' → Arthritis (A is Arthritis)
4. Respondent 26: 'd' → Diabetes
5. Respondent 95: 'e' → Hypertension
6. Respondent 140: 'c' → Cancer (C is Cancer, so this one counts)
7. Respondent 92: 'a' → Arthritis
8. Respondent 16: 'e' → Hypertension
9. Respondent 102: 'e' → Hypertension
10. Respondent 71: 'd' → Diabetes
11. Respondent 49: 'a' → Arthritis
12. Respondent 32: 'e' → Hypertension

Looking through each, only respondent 140 has a Medical Condition of 'c', which maps to Cancer. So the count should be 1. Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss any others. Scanning again: 140 is the only one with 'c'. All others have different codes. So the answer is 1.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents have Gender = 'Male' and Admission Type = 'Elective'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking how many respondents have Gender as 'Male' and Admission Type as 'Elective'. 

First, I need to refer to the questions section to understand the mapping of the MCQ options. 

Looking at the Gender question: it's an MCQ with options A. Female and B. Male. So, in the responses, 'a' would be Female and 'b' would be Male.

For Admission Type, the options are A. Elective, B. Emergency, C. Urgent. So, 'a' corresponds to Elective, 'b' to Emergency, and 'c' to Urgent.

Now, I need to go through each respondent in the responses and check two things: their Gender answer and their Admission Type answer. 

Let's list out each respondent:

1. Respondent 24: Gender is 'a' (Female), Admission Type 'b' (Emergency) → Doesn't meet criteria.
2. Respondent 55: Gender 'b' (Male), Admission Type 'b' (Emergency) → No.
3. Respondent 6: Gender 'b' (Male), Admission Type 'a' (Elective) → Yes. Count 1.
4. Respondent 13: Gender 'b' (Male), Admission Type 'b' → No.
5. Respondent 86: Gender 'a' → No.
6. Respondent 63: Gender 'b', Admission Type 'a' (Elective) → Yes. Count 2.
7. Respondent 33: Gender 'b', Admission Type 'b' → No.
8. Respondent 145: Gender 'b', Admission Type 'c' → No.
9. Respondent 53: Gender 'b', Admission Type 'c' → No.
10. Respondent 18: Gender 'b', Admission Type 'b' → No.
11. Respondent 142: Gender 'a' → No.
12. Respondent 54: Gender 'a' → No.

Wait, let me double-check each one to be sure.

Respondent 6: Gender is 'b' (Male), Admission Type 'a' (Elective) → Yes. That's one.

Respondent 63: Gender 'b' (Male), Admission Type 'a' (Elective) → Yes. That's two.

Are there any others? Let me check again.

Looking through all respondents again:

- Respondent 6: Yes.
- Respondent 63: Yes.
- Any others? Respondent 53 has Admission Type 'c' (Urgent). Respondent 86 is Female. Respondent 55 is Male but Admission Type 'b'. Respondent 33 is Male but Admission Type 'b'. Respondent 13 is Male but Admission Type 'b'. Respondent 18 is Male but Admission Type 'b'. 

So only respondents 6 and 63 meet both conditions. Therefore, the count should be 2.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
How many respondents have Gender = 'Female' and Insurance Provider = 'UnitedHealthcare'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking how many respondents have a Gender of 'Female' and an Insurance Provider of 'UnitedHealthcare'. 

First, I need to refer to the questions section to understand the mapping of the MCQ options. 

Looking at the Gender question: [MCQ: A. Female B. Male]. So, the code 'a' corresponds to Female and 'b' to Male. 

Next, the Insurance Provider question: [MCQ: A. Aetna B. Blue Cross C. Cigna D. Medicare E. UnitedHealthcare]. Here, the code 'e' would map to UnitedHealthcare.

Now, I need to go through each respondent in the responses section and check two things: their Gender answer and their Insurance Provider answer. 

Let's list out all respondents:

1. Respondent 60: Gender is 'b' (Male), Insurance Provider 'e' (UnitedHealthcare). Doesn't meet both conditions.
2. Respondent 85: Gender 'b' (Male), Insurance 'd' (Medicare). No.
3. Respondent 38: Gender 'b' (Male), Insurance 'a' (Aetna). No.
4. Respondent 1: Gender 'b' (Male), Insurance 'd' (Medicare). No.
5. Respondent 71: Gender 'b' (Male), Insurance 'b' (Blue Cross). No.
6. Respondent 34: Gender 'a' (Female), Insurance 'c' (Cigna). So Gender is correct, but Insurance is Cigna, not UnitedHealthcare. Doesn't meet both.
7. Respondent 139: Gender is empty. So even if Insurance is 'b' (Blue Cross), Gender isn't Female. Doesn't count.
8. Respondent 65: Gender 'a' (Female), Insurance 'c' (Cigna). Again, Insurance is Cigna, not UnitedHealthcare. 

Looking through all, there's no respondent where both Gender is 'a' (Female) and Insurance Provider is 'e' (UnitedHealthcare). 

Wait, let me double-check each entry to make sure I didn't miss any. 

Respondent 34: Female, Insurance Cigna. 
Respondent 65: Female, Insurance Cigna. 
No one else has Gender 'a'. So the count is zero.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

How many respondents have Gender = 'Female' and Medical Condition = 'Asthma'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking how many respondents are female and have Asthma as their medical condition. 

First, I need to look at the data provided. The dataset includes a list of respondents with their answers to various questions. The key here is to check two specific answers for each respondent: Gender and Medical Condition.

Starting with the Gender question. The schema says it's an MCQ with options A. Female and B. Male. So, in the responses, if the answer is 'a', that's Female, and 'b' is Male. 

Next, the Medical Condition question. The options are A. Arthritis, B. Asthma, C. Cancer, D. Diabetes, E. Hypertension, F. Obesity. So, a response of 'b' here would mean Asthma.

Now, I need to go through each respondent and check these two fields. Let's list out all the respondents:

1. Respondent 29: Gender is 'b' (Male), Medical Condition 'c' (Cancer). Doesn't match.
2. Respondent 7: Gender 'b' (Male), Medical Condition 'd' (Diabetes). No.
3. Respondent 34: Gender 'a' (Female), Medical Condition 'e' (Hypertension). Female but not Asthma.
4. Respondent 4: Gender 'b' (Male), Medical Condition 'd' (Diabetes). No.
5. Respondent 92: Gender 'b' (Male), Medical Condition 'a' (Arthritis). No.
6. Respondent 61: Gender 'b' (Male), Medical Condition 'b' (Asthma). Male with Asthma, so doesn't meet both criteria.
7. Respondent 83: Gender 'a' (Female), Medical Condition 'a' (Arthritis). Female but condition is Arthritis.

Looking through all of them, none of the female respondents (34 and 83) have Asthma. The only respondent with Asthma is 61, but they are male. So the count should be zero.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
How many respondents have a Blood Type of 'O+'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question. The task is to find out how many respondents have a Blood Type of 'O+'. 

First, I need to look at the questions section to understand how the Blood Type is coded. The Blood Type question is a multiple-choice question (MCQ) with options: A. A+, B. A-, C. AB+, D. AB-, E. B+, F. B-, G. O+, H. O-. So each answer in the responses will be a letter corresponding to these options.

Now, I need to check each respondent's answer for the Blood Type. The code for 'O+' is option G. Let's go through each respondent one by one.

Respondent 45: Blood Type is 'b'. Looking at the options, 'b' corresponds to A-. Not O+.

Respondent 68: Blood Type is 'g'. Option G is O+. So this is a match. Count 1.

Respondent 14: Blood Type is 'e'. Option E is B+. Not a match.

Respondent 33: Blood Type is 'e' again, which is B+. Not a match.

Respondent 108: Blood Type is 'a', which is A+. Not a match.

So only respondent 68 has Blood Type O+. Therefore, the count is 1.

- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

How many respondents have Gender = 'Female' and Medical Condition = 'Diabetes'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking how many respondents have a Gender of 'Female' and a Medical Condition of 'Diabetes'. 

First, I need to refer to the questions section to understand the mapping of the MCQ options. 

Looking at the Gender question: it's an MCQ with options A. Female and B. Male. So, if a respondent's answer is 'a', that corresponds to Female.

For the Medical Condition question, the options are A. Arthritis, B. Asthma, C. Cancer, D. Diabetes, E. Hypertension, F. Obesity. So, 'd' would map to Diabetes.

Now, I need to go through each respondent in the responses section and check if both their Gender is 'a' (Female) and their Medical Condition is 'd' (Diabetes).

Let's check each respondent one by one:

Respondent 17: Gender is 'a' (Female), Medical Condition is 'c' (Cancer). Doesn't match.

Respondent 122: Gender 'a' (Female), Medical Condition 'd' (Diabetes). This one matches both conditions. Count = 1.

Respondent 115: Gender 'b' (Male), Medical Condition 'e' (Hypertension). Doesn't match.

Respondent 93: Gender 'a' (Female), Medical Condition 'a' (Arthritis). Doesn't match.

Respondent 132: Gender 'a' (Female), Medical Condition 'f' (Obesity). Doesn't match.

Respondent 28: Gender 'b' (Male), Medical Condition 'd' (Diabetes). Gender is Male, so doesn't match.

So, only respondent 122 meets both criteria. The count is 1.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents have a Blood Type of 'A+'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question: ""How many respondents have a Blood Type of 'A+'?"" 

First, I need to look at the data provided. The Blood Type question is an MCQ with options A. A+, B. A-, C. AB+, D. AB-, E. B+, F. B-, G. O+, H. O-. So each answer in the responses for Blood Type is a letter code that corresponds to one of these options.

Now, I need to go through each respondent's answer for Blood Type and check if it's 'A' (since A is the code for A+). But wait, the options are A. A+, so the code 'a' would map to A+. Let me confirm the schema again. The Blood Type question lists A. A+ as the first option, so any answer with 'a' (case-insensitive) should be A+.

Now, let's check each respondent one by one:

Respondent 129: Blood Type is 'e' → E. B+ → Not A+.
Respondent 57: 'h' → H. O- → No.
Respondent 12: 'c' → C. AB+ → No.
Respondent 134: 'd' → D. AB- → No.
Respondent 78: 'e' → E. B+ → No.
Respondent 118: 'd' → D. AB- → No.
Respondent 8: 'e' → E. B+ → No.
Respondent 16: 'a' → A. A+ → Yes, count 1.
Respondent 123: 'd' → D. AB- → No.
Respondent 103: 'c' → C. AB+ → No.
Respondent 110: 'e' → E. B+ → No.
Respondent 28: 'c' → C. AB+ → No.

Wait, I think I missed some respondents. Let me recount. The responses section lists 12 respondents: 129, 57, 12, 134, 78, 118, 8, 16, 123, 103, 110, 28. That's 12 total. 

Looking again:

- Respondent 16 has Blood Type 'a' → A+ → count 1.
- Any others? Let me check again:

Respondent 16 is the only one with 'a' in Blood Type. All others have codes like e, h, c, d, etc. So the total is 1. 

Wait, but the example given in the problem had a similar structure, and the answer was 1. But let me make sure I didn't miss any. Let me go through each again:

129: e → B+
57: h → O-
12: c → AB+
134: d → AB-
78: e → B+
118: d → AB-
8: e → B+
16: a → A+ (1)
123: d → AB-
103: c → AB+
110: e → B+
28: c → AB+

Yes, only respondent 16 has Blood Type A+. So the answer should be 1.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
How many respondents have Gender = 'Male' and Insurance Provider = 'Aetna'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking how many respondents have Gender as 'Male' and Insurance Provider as 'Aetna'. 

First, I need to refer to the questions section to understand the mapping of the MCQ options. 

Looking at the Gender question: it's an MCQ with options A. Female and B. Male. So, in the responses, 'a' corresponds to Female and 'b' to Male.

Next, the Insurance Provider question is an MCQ with options A. Aetna, B. Blue Cross, C. Cigna, D. Medicare, E. UnitedHealthcare. So, the code 'a' here would map to Aetna.

Now, I need to go through each respondent in the responses section and check two things: their Gender answer and their Insurance Provider answer. 

Let's list out all respondents and their relevant answers:

Respondent 114: Gender is 'a' (Female), Insurance Provider 'b' (Blue Cross) → Doesn't meet criteria.

Respondent 19: Gender 'a' (Female), Insurance 'c' (Cigna) → No.

Respondent 21: Gender 'b' (Male), Insurance 'e' (UnitedHealthcare) → Insurance not Aetna.

Respondent 83: Gender 'a' (Female), Insurance 'e' → No.

Respondent 38: Gender 'b' (Male), Insurance 'a' (Aetna) → This one matches both conditions. Count 1.

Respondent 17: Gender 'a' (Female), Insurance 'd' (Medicare) → No.

Respondent 33: Gender 'b' (Male), Insurance 'a' (Aetna) → Another match. Now count is 2.

Respondent 71: Gender 'b' (Male), Insurance 'b' (Blue Cross) → Insurance doesn't match.

Respondent 150: Gender 'b' (Male), Insurance 'd' (Medicare) → No.

Respondent 141: Gender 'a' (Female), Insurance 'd' → No.

Respondent 84: Gender 'b' (Male), Insurance 'c' (Cigna) → No.

Respondent 98: Gender 'a' (Female), Insurance 'e' → No.

Wait, let me double-check respondents 38 and 33. 

Respondent 38: Gender is 'b' (Male), Insurance Provider is 'a' (Aetna). Correct. 

Respondent 33: Gender 'b' (Male), Insurance 'a' (Aetna). Correct. 

So that's two respondents. But wait, let me check again to make sure I didn't miss any others. 

Looking through all the respondents again:

- 38: Male, Aetna → Yes
- 33: Male, Aetna → Yes
- Any others? Let's check each one again:

114: Female, Blue Cross → No
19: Female, Cigna → No
21: Male, UnitedHealthcare → No
83: Female, UnitedHealthcare → No
17: Female, Medicare → No
71: Male, Blue Cross → No
150: Male, Medicare → No
141: Female, Medicare → No
84: Male, Cigna → No
98: Female, UnitedHealthcare → No

Only respondents 38 and 33 meet both conditions. So the count should be 2. But wait, the example given in the problem had an answer of 1. Wait, no, the example was a different question (Gender=Male and Medical Condition=Hypertension). The current task is different. 

So according to this analysis, the answer should be 2. But let me verify once more to be certain. 

Yes, respondents 38 and 33 are both Male (Gender 'b') and have Insurance Provider 'a' (Aetna). Therefore, the total is 2.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents have Gender = 'Male' and Admission Type = 'Urgent'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find out how many respondents have Gender as 'Male' and Admission Type as 'Urgent'. 

First, I need to refer to the questions section to understand the mapping of the MCQ options. 

Looking at the Gender question: it's an MCQ with options A. Female and B. Male. So, if a respondent's answer is 'a', that's Female, and 'b' is Male.

Next, the Admission Type question is an MCQ with options A. Elective, B. Emergency, C. Urgent. So, the code 'c' corresponds to Urgent.

Now, I need to go through each respondent in the responses section and check two things: their Gender answer and their Admission Type answer. 

Let's list out all respondents:

1. Respondent 117: Gender is 'a' (Female), Admission Type 'a' (Elective) → Doesn't match.
2. Respondent 130: Gender 'a' (Female), Admission Type 'a' (Elective) → No.
3. Respondent 111: Gender 'a' (Female), Admission Type 'b' (Emergency) → No.
4. Respondent 26: Gender 'a' (Female), Admission Type 'a' → No.
5. Respondent 30: Gender 'a' (Female), Admission Type 'b' → No.
6. Respondent 142: Gender 'a' (Female), Admission Type 'a' → No.
7. Respondent 56: Gender 'b' (Male), Admission Type 'c' (Urgent) → Yes. Count 1.
8. Respondent 116: Gender 'a' (Female), Admission Type 'c' → No.
9. Respondent 59: Gender 'a' (Female), Admission Type 'c' → No.

So, only respondent 56 meets both conditions. Therefore, the count is 1.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
How many respondents with Gender = 'Female' and Admission Type = 'Emergency' have a Billing Amount below 30000?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking for the number of respondents who are Female, had an Emergency admission type, and have a Billing Amount below 30,000. 

First, I need to understand the structure of the data provided. The dataset includes a list of respondents, each with various answers to different questions. The questions section defines what each answer code means. 

Starting with the Gender: the question is a MCQ with options A. Female and B. Male. So, in the responses, if the answer is 'a', that's Female, 'b' is Male.

Next, Admission Type: the options are A. Elective, B. Emergency, C. Urgent. So, 'b' in the response corresponds to Emergency.

Billing Amount is an open-ended question, so the value is a number. We need to check if it's less than 30,000.

Now, I need to go through each respondent and check these three conditions. Let's list out each respondent and their relevant answers.

Looking at respondent 87: Gender is 'a' (Female), Admission Type is 'a' (Elective). So, doesn't meet the Admission Type condition. Skip.

Respondent 117: Gender 'a' (Female), Admission Type 'a' (Elective). Billing is 20228, which is below 30k. But Admission Type is Elective, so no.

Respondent 103: Gender 'b' (Male). Already doesn't meet the Gender condition. Skip.

Respondent 107: Gender 'a' (Female), Admission Type 'a' (Elective). Billing 3326. Again, Admission Type is Elective. Doesn't qualify.

Respondent 25: Gender 'a' (Female), Admission Type 'a' (Elective). Billing 6313. Still Elective. No.

Respondent 81: Gender 'a' (Female), Admission Type 'b' (Emergency). Billing 14681. This meets all three conditions: Female, Emergency, Billing <30k. So count 1.

Respondent 110: Gender 'b' (Male). Skip.

Respondent 66: Gender 'b' (Male). Skip.

Respondent 96: Gender 'b' (Male). Skip.

Respondent 40: Gender 'a' (Female), Admission Type 'a' (Elective). Billing 17696. Admission Type is Elective, so no.

Respondent 122: Gender 'a' (Female), Admission Type 'b' (Emergency). Billing 48996. This is above 30k, so doesn't meet the billing condition. So no.

So, only respondent 81 meets all three criteria. Therefore, the count is 1.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

How many respondents from 'HOSP_96' are over the age of 60 and are not taking 'Aspirin'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking: How many respondents from 'HOSP_96' are over the age of 60 and are not taking 'Aspirin'? 

First, I need to parse the data provided in the XML format. Let's look at the responses section. Each respondent has an ID and various answers to the questions. The key points here are the Hospital, Age, and Medication.

The Hospital in question is 'HOSP_96'. So I need to filter all respondents where the Hospital answer is 'HOSP_96'. Let's check each respondent's Hospital entry.

Looking at the respondents:
- Respondent 24: Hospital is HOSP_24
- Respondent 22: HOSP_22
- Respondent 111: HOSP_111
- Respondent 25: HOSP_25
- Respondent 96: HOSP_96
- Respondent 34: HOSP_34

So only respondent 96 is from HOSP_96. Now, check their age. The Age for respondent 96 is 18. The question requires the age to be over 60. Since 18 is not over 60, this respondent doesn't meet the age criteria. 

Wait, but maybe I missed other respondents? Let me double-check. The data has six respondents, and only respondent 96 is in HOSP_96. The others are in different hospitals. So even if there were other respondents in HOSP_96, but according to the data, there's only one. 

Now, even if the age was over 60, we need to check if they are not taking Aspirin. The Medication for respondent 96 is 'a'. Looking at the Medication question in the schema, the options are A. Aspirin, B. Ibuprofen, C. Lipitor, D. Paracetamol, E. Penicillin. So 'a' maps to Aspirin. But the question asks for those NOT taking Aspirin. Since respondent 96 is taking Aspirin, even if their age was over 60, they wouldn't count. But their age is 18, so they are excluded regardless.

Therefore, there are no respondents from HOSP_96 who are over 60 and not taking Aspirin. The answer should be 0.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the respondents whose length of stay is between 15 and 25 days and who were admitted for an 'Emergency' procedure.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents who stayed between 15 and 25 days and were admitted for an 'Emergency' procedure. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The questions section defines each field. The 'Admission Type' is an MCQ with options A. Elective, B. Emergency, C. Urgent. So, if a respondent's answer is 'b', that maps to 'Emergency'. 

Next, the length of stay. The dates involved are 'Date of Admission' and 'Discharge Date', both open-ended. To calculate the length of stay, I need to find the difference between these two dates for each respondent. The dates are in YYYY-MM-DD format. 

Let's go through each respondent one by one.

Respondent 144:
- Admission Date: 2022-09-22
- Discharge Date: 2022-11-07
Calculating the days between these dates. From September 22 to November 7. September has 30 days, so from Sept 22 to Sept 30 is 8 days. October has 31 days. November 7 is 7 days. Total: 8 + 31 + 7 = 46 days. That's way over 25, so this one doesn't qualify. Also, their Admission Type is 'c', which maps to 'Urgent' (from the schema), so even if the days were in range, it's not Emergency. So no.

Respondent 85:
- Admission: 2022-10-29
- Discharge: 2022-11-20
October 29 to October 31 is 2 days. November 1 to 20 is 20 days. Total 22 days. That's within 15-25. Admission Type is 'b' which is Emergency. So this one counts. 

Respondent 32:
- Admission: 2024-01-15
- Discharge: 2024-02-24
January 15 to January 31 is 16 days. February 24 is 24 days. Total 16 +24 = 40 days. Over 25. Admission Type is 'c' (Urgent). Doesn't qualify.

Respondent 106:
- Admission: 2020-11-18
- Discharge: 2021-01-16
Wait, that's from November 18, 2020 to January 16, 2021. November has 30 days, so from 18th to 30th is 12 days. December has 31, January 16 is 16 days. Total: 12 +31 +16 = 59 days. Way over. Admission Type is 'a' (Elective). So no.

Respondent 91:
- Admission: 2022-07-08
- Discharge: 2022-06-30
Wait, that's a problem. The discharge date is before the admission date. That can't be right. Maybe a typo? Let me check. The admission is July 8, 2022, discharge June 30, 2022. That's impossible. So this data entry is invalid. Maybe the dates are swapped? But since we have to take the data as given, the length of stay would be negative, which doesn't make sense. So this respondent's data is invalid, so we can't count them. Also, their Admission Type is 'a' (Elective), so even if dates were correct, it's not Emergency.

So the only one that meets the criteria is respondent 85. Therefore, the count is 1.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
How many respondents with Gender = 'Female' and Admission Type = 'Emergency' have a Billing Amount below 30000?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking for the number of respondents who are Female, had an Emergency admission type, and have a Billing Amount below 30,000.

First, I need to understand the data structure. The questions section defines each field. For Gender, the options are A. Female and B. Male. Admission Type is a MCQ with options A. Elective, B. Emergency, C. Urgent. Billing Amount is an open-ended question, so the value is a number.

Now, I'll go through each respondent in the responses and check the three conditions:

1. Gender is Female (answer 'a' in the data)
2. Admission Type is Emergency (answer 'b' in the data)
3. Billing Amount is less than 30,000

Let's check each respondent one by one:

Respondent 14: Gender is 'a' (Female), Admission Type 'a' (Elective). Doesn't meet Admission Type condition. Billing is 21186. But since Admission Type isn't Emergency, skip.

Respondent 74: Gender 'b' (Male). Skip.

Respondent 80: Gender 'b' (Male). Skip.

Respondent 91: Gender 'a' (Female). Admission Type 'a' (Elective). Billing 26787. Admission Type not Emergency. Skip.

Respondent 27: Gender 'a' (Female). Admission Type 'b' (Emergency). Billing 30591. But 30591 is over 30k. Doesn't meet billing condition.

Respondent 148: Gender 'b' (Male). Skip.

Respondent 130: Gender 'a' (Female). Admission Type 'a' (Elective). Billing 34618. Admission Type not Emergency. Skip.

Respondent 55: Gender 'b' (Male). Skip.

Respondent 40: Gender 'a' (Female). Admission Type 'a' (Elective). Billing 17696. Admission Type not Emergency. Skip.

Respondent 124: Gender 'b' (Male). Skip.

Respondent 58: Gender 'b' (Male). Skip.

Wait, did I miss any? Let me check again. The only respondent with Gender 'a' (Female) and Admission Type 'b' (Emergency) is respondent 27, but their billing is 30,591 which is over 30k. Are there any others?

Looking again, respondent 27: Billing is 30591, which is 30,591. That's above 30,000. So no one meets all three conditions. Therefore, the count should be 0. Wait, but let me check again to be sure.

Wait, maybe I missed someone. Let me list all Female respondents first:

Respondent 14: Female, Admission Elective, Billing 21186. Not Emergency.

Respondent 91: Female, Elective, 26787.

Respondent 27: Female, Emergency, 30591.

Respondent 130: Female, Elective, 34618.

Respondent 40: Female, Elective, 17696.

So only respondent 27 has Admission Type Emergency and is Female, but the billing is over 30k. So no one meets all three. Therefore, the answer is 0.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents with Gender = 'Female' and Admission Type = 'Elective' have a Billing Amount below 40000?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking for the number of respondents who are Female, had an Elective admission type, and have a Billing Amount below 40,000. 

First, I need to refer to the questions schema to understand the mapping of the codes. For Gender, the options are A. Female and B. Male. So, a response of 'a' for Gender means Female. For Admission Type, the options are A. Elective, B. Emergency, C. Urgent. So, 'a' in the response corresponds to Elective.

Now, looking at the responses section, I need to check each respondent's answers. Let's go through each respondent one by one.

Respondent 90: Gender is 'a' (Female), Admission Type is 'c' (Urgent). Billing Amount is 25230. Since Admission Type is Urgent, this doesn't meet the criteria. So, no.

Respondent 143: Gender is 'b' (Male). So, immediately excluded. Next.

Respondent 95: Gender is 'a' (Female). Admission Type is 'a' (Elective). Billing Amount is 26062. Both conditions are met, and 26062 is below 40,000. So, count this one.

Respondent 30: Gender is 'a' (Female). Admission Type is 'b' (Emergency). Billing Amount is 10301. Admission Type is Emergency, so no.

Respondent 72: Gender is 'a' (Female). Admission Type is 'b' (Emergency). Billing Amount is 30437. Again, Admission Type is Emergency. Doesn't qualify.

Respondent 147: Gender is 'a' (Female). Admission Type is 'b' (Emergency). Billing Amount is 25250. Admission Type is Emergency. So, no.

So, only respondent 95 meets all the criteria: Female, Elective admission, and Billing Amount under 40,000. Therefore, the count is 1.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the respondents whose length of stay is between 10 and 20 days and who were admitted for an 'Emergency' procedure.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents whose length of stay is between 10 and 20 days and who were admitted for an 'Emergency' procedure. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The dataset has a 'questions' section that defines each field. The 'Medical Condition' and 'Admission Type' are MCQs, so their answers are given as letters which need to be mapped to their corresponding options. The 'Date of Admission' and 'Discharge Date' are open-ended, so their values are dates in the format YYYY-MM-DD.

The key steps here are:
1. Identify respondents with 'Admission Type' as 'Emergency'. According to the schema, the Admission Type options are A. Elective, B. Emergency, C. Urgent. So, any answer with 'b' (case-insensitive) in the response corresponds to Emergency.
2. For each such respondent, calculate the length of stay by finding the difference between Discharge Date and Admission Date.
3. Check if the length of stay is between 10 and 20 days inclusive.
4. Count how many respondents meet both criteria.

Now, let's go through each respondent one by one.

Respondent 110:
- Admission Type: 'a' → Elective. So, skip this one.

Respondent 144:
- Admission Type: 'c' → Urgent. Skip.

Respondent 143:
- Admission Type: 'b' → Emergency. Now calculate the stay. Admission Date: 2022-12-10, Discharge: 2022-09-27. Wait, that's a problem. The discharge date is before the admission date. That can't be right. Maybe a typo? Let me check the dates again. Admission is 2022-12-10 (December 10, 2022) and discharge is 2022-09-27 (September 27, 2022). That's impossible. Negative days. Maybe the dates are swapped, but as per the data, this would result in a negative length of stay. So this respondent's data is invalid, so we can't count them.

Respondent 7:
- Admission Type: 'b' → Emergency. Admission Date: 2021-03-05, Discharge: 2021-03-05. Length of stay is 0 days. So not between 10-20. Exclude.

Respondent 69:
- Admission Type: 'b' → Emergency. Admission: 2022-01-09, Discharge: 2022-01-12. Let's calculate the days. From Jan 9 to Jan 12 is 3 days (12-9=3). So 3 days. Not in range. Exclude.

Respondent 8:
- Admission Type: 'a' → Elective. Skip.

Respondent 47:
- Admission Type: 'c' → Urgent. Skip.

Respondent 70:
- Admission Type: 'a' → Elective. Skip.

Wait, so among all respondents, only respondent 143 and 7, 69 had Admission Type 'b' (Emergency). But 143's dates are invalid, 7's stay is 0 days, 69's is 3 days. None of them have a length of stay between 10-20 days. So the count would be zero. But let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anyone.

Wait, let me check all respondents again:

Looking at each respondent's Admission Type:

- 110: a (Elective)
- 144: c (Urgent)
- 143: b (Emergency)
- 7: b (Emergency)
- 69: b (Emergency)
- 8: a (Elective)
- 47: c (Urgent)
- 70: a (Elective)

So three respondents have Emergency admission: 143, 7, 69.

Now calculate their length of stay:

143: Admission 2022-12-10, Discharge 2022-09-27. Negative days. Invalid, so exclude.

7: Admission and discharge on the same day: 0 days.

69: 2022-01-09 to 2022-01-12: 3 days.

So none of them meet the 10-20 days requirement. Therefore, the answer is 0.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the respondents whose length of stay is between 15 and 25 days and who were admitted for an 'Emergency' procedure.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents whose length of stay is between 15 and 25 days and who were admitted for an 'Emergency' procedure. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The dataset has a 'questions' section that defines each field. The 'Medical Condition' and 'Admission Type' are MCQs, so their answers are given as letters which need to be mapped to their corresponding options. The 'Date of Admission' and 'Discharge Date' are open-ended, so their values are dates in the format YYYY-MM-DD.

The key steps here are:
1. Identify respondents with 'Admission Type' as 'Emergency'. According to the schema, the Admission Type options are A. Elective, B. Emergency, C. Urgent. So, any answer with 'b' (case-insensitive) in the Admission Type field corresponds to Emergency.
2. For each of those respondents, calculate the length of stay by finding the difference between the Discharge Date and Admission Date.
3. Check if the length of stay is between 15 and 25 days inclusive.
4. Count how many respondents meet both criteria.

Now, let's go through each respondent in the responses section.

Respondent 87:
- Admission Type is 'a' → Elective. Doesn't meet the Emergency criteria. Skip.

Respondent 90:
- Admission Type is 'c' → Urgent. Not Emergency. Skip.

Respondent 2:
- Admission Type is 'b' → Emergency. Now calculate the stay. Admission Date: 2021-01-21, Discharge: 2020-08-27. Wait, that's a problem. The discharge date is before the admission date. That can't be right. Maybe a typo? Let me check the dates again. Admission is 2021-01-21 and discharge is 2020-08-27. That's impossible; discharge can't be before admission. This might be an error in the data. Since the dates are invalid, perhaps this respondent should be excluded, or maybe it's a typo. But since we have to work with the given data, the calculation would result in a negative number of days, which doesn't fit the 15-25 range. So this respondent doesn't count.

Respondent 47:
- Admission Type is 'c' → Urgent. Skip.

Respondent 37:
- Admission Type is 'b' → Emergency. Admission Date: 2022-05-12, Discharge: 2022-07-18. Let's calculate the days between these dates. From May 12 to July 18, 2022. May has 31 days, so from May 12 to May 31: 20 days (including the 12th? Wait, no. May 12 to May 31 is 19 days (31-12=19). Then June has 30 days, and July 18 is 18 days. Total: 19 + 30 + 18 = 67 days. That's way over 25. So this doesn't qualify.

Respondent 145:
- Admission Type is 'c' → Urgent. Skip.

Respondent 103:
- Admission Type is 'b' → Emergency. Admission Date: 2023-10-11, Discharge: 2024-01-19. Let's calculate. From October 11, 2023, to January 19, 2024. October has 31 days, so 31-11=20 days left in October (including the 11th? Wait, if admission is on the 11th, then days in October: 31 - 11 + 1 = 21 days. Then November: 30, December: 31, January: 19. Total: 21 + 30 +31 +19 = 101 days. Way over 25. Doesn't qualify.

Respondent 18:
- Admission Type is 'b' → Emergency. Admission Date: 2019-08-18, Discharge: 2019-11-22. Let's calculate. August 18 to August 31: 14 days (31-18+1=14). September: 30, October:31, November:22. Total:14+30+31+22=97 days. Over 25.

Respondent 8:
- Admission Type is 'a' → Elective. Skip.

Wait, so among all respondents, only respondent 2 and 37 and 103 and 18 have Admission Type 'b' (Emergency). But their lengths of stay are all either invalid (respondent 2) or way over 25 days. So none of them meet the 15-25 days criteria. 

But wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again.

Wait, respondent 2's dates: Admission 2021-01-21, Discharge 2020-08-27. That's impossible. So perhaps a data entry error. If we ignore this entry, then the other Emergency admissions (37, 103, 18) have stays of 67, 101, 97 days. None are between 15-25. 

Therefore, the count is zero. But wait, let me check if I missed any other respondents. Let's list all respondents:

Looking at the responses again:

Respondent 87: Admission Type a → Elective.

Respondent 90: Admission Type c → Urgent.

Respondent 2: Admission Type b → Emergency (invalid dates).

Respondent 47: Admission Type c → Urgent.

Respondent 37: Admission Type b → Emergency (67 days).

Respondent 145: Admission Type c → Urgent.

Respondent 103: Admission Type b → Emergency (101 days).

Respondent 18: Admission Type b → Emergency (97 days).

Respondent 8: Admission Type a → Elective.

So only respondents 2, 37, 103, 18 have Emergency admission. All of their stays are either invalid or over 25 days. Therefore, the count is 0.

But wait, maybe I miscalculated respondent 37's stay. Let me recheck:

Admission Date: 2022-05-12, Discharge: 2022-07-18.

From May 12 to May 31: 20 days (including the 12th: 31-12+1=20 days).

June: 30 days.

July 1 to July 18: 18 days.

Total: 20 + 30 +18 = 68 days. Yes, that's correct. So over 25.

No one else. So the answer is 0.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the respondents whose length of stay is between 10 and 20 days and who were admitted for an 'Elective' procedure.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents whose length of stay is between 10 and 20 days and who were admitted for an 'Elective' procedure. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The questionnaire has a 'responses' section with multiple respondents, each having answers to various questions. The questions section defines each question, including the 'Admission Type' as an MCQ with options A. Elective, B. Emergency, C. Urgent. So, if a respondent's answer for Admission Type is 'a', that maps to 'Elective'.

Next, I need to calculate the length of stay for each respondent. The dates involved are 'Date of Admission' and 'Discharge Date'. Both are open-ended fields, so the values are in YYYY-MM-DD format. To find the length of stay, I'll compute the difference between Discharge Date and Admission Date for each respondent.

Let's go through each respondent one by one:

1. **Respondent 136**:
   - Admission Date: 2023-06-25
   - Discharge Date: 2023-07-05
   - Calculating the days: June has 30 days, so from June 25 to June 30 is 5 days (25th to 30th inclusive is 6 days, but since 25th is the start, 30-25=5 days, plus 5 days in July (1st to 5th). Wait, actually, the total days between 2023-06-25 and 2023-07-05 is 10 days (June 25 to July 5 is 11 days if including both start and end dates). Wait, need to calculate correctly. Let's use date difference: June 25 to July 5 is 10 days (since 25th to 30th is 5 days, then July 1-5 is 5 days, total 10). But actually, the exact difference can be calculated as (2023-07-05 - 2023-06-25) = 10 days. So length of stay is 10 days.
   - Admission Type: 'c' which maps to 'Urgent' (from the MCQ options). So this doesn't meet the 'Elective' criteria. So exclude.

2. **Respondent 56**:
   - Admission Date: 2020-01-30
   - Discharge Date: 2020-06-01
   - Wait, that's a long stay. Let's calculate the days. From January 30 to June 1. Let's break it down:
     - January: 30th to 31st is 2 days (30 and 31)
     - February 2020 is a leap year, so 29 days
     - March: 31 days
     - April: 30 days
     - May: 31 days
     - June 1: 1 day
     Total: 2 + 29 +31 +30 +31 +1 = 124 days. That's way over 20 days. So exclude. Also, Admission Type is 'c' (Urgent), so even if the days were within range, it's not Elective.

3. **Respondent 97**:
   - Admission Date: 2020-07-01
   - Discharge Date: 2020-03-05. Wait, that's impossible. The discharge date is before the admission date. That must be a typo. Wait, looking at the data again. The admission date is 2020-07-01 and discharge is 2020-03-05. That's not possible. Maybe the dates are swapped? Or a data entry error. Since discharge date is before admission, the length of stay would be negative, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps this is an error in the data. But since we have to work with the given data, maybe it's a typo. For example, maybe the discharge date should be 2020-08-05 or 2020-07-05. But as per the data provided, the discharge is March 5, which is before July. So the length of stay is negative. Therefore, this respondent's data is invalid for this calculation. So we can't consider them. Alternatively, maybe the dates are in a different format, but the format is YYYY-MM-DD. So this is a problem. Since the discharge date is before admission, we can't calculate a valid length of stay. So this respondent is excluded.

4. **Respondent 108**:
   - Admission Date: 2020-08-11
   - Discharge Date: 2020-07-20. Again, discharge is before admission. Another data inconsistency. So same issue as respondent 97. Exclude.

5. **Respondent 117**:
   - Admission Date: 2021-01-17
   - Discharge Date: 2021-07-31
   - Calculate days: From Jan 17 to July 31. Let's compute:
     - January: 17 to 31: 15 days (including 17th)
     - February: 28 days (2021 is not a leap year)
     - March: 31
     - April: 30
     - May: 31
     - June: 30
     - July: 31 (up to 31st)
     Total: 15 +28+31+30+31+30+31 = 196 days. Way over 20. Admission Type is 'a' which is Elective. But since the stay is 196 days, it's outside the 10-20 range. Exclude.

6. **Respondent 88**:
   - Admission Date: 2023-06-08
   - Discharge Date: 2023-07-02
   - Calculate days: June 8 to July 2. June has 30 days, so from June 8 to June 30 is 23 days (30-8+1=23). Then July 1 and 2: 2 days. Total 25 days. So 25 days. Admission Type is 'a' (Elective). 25 days is more than 20, so exclude.

Wait, but none of the respondents so far meet both criteria. But let's check again. Maybe I made a mistake in date calculations.

Wait, let's recheck respondent 97 and 108. Their discharge dates are before admission dates. That's impossible. So perhaps there's a typo in the data. For example, respondent 97's admission is 2020-07-01 and discharge 2020-03-05. Maybe the discharge date should be 2020-08-05? If that's the case, the length would be 35 days (July 1 to Aug 5: 35 days). But since the data is as given, we can't assume. So we have to treat those as invalid and exclude them.

So, looking at all respondents:

- Respondent 136: 10 days, but Admission Type is Urgent. Doesn't qualify.
- Respondent 56: 124 days, Urgent. No.
- Respondent 97: Invalid dates. Exclude.
- Respondent 108: Invalid dates. Exclude.
- Respondent 117: 196 days, Elective. Over 20.
- Respondent 88: 25 days, Elective. Over 20.

So none of the respondents meet both criteria. But wait, the example in the problem had an answer of 1. Maybe I missed someone. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the length of stay for respondent 136. Let's recalculate:

Admission: 2023-06-25
Discharge: 2023-07-05

June 25 to June 30 is 6 days (25,26,27,28,29,30). Then July 1 to 5 is 5 days. Total 6+5=11 days. Wait, wait, the difference between June 25 and July 5 is 10 days. Because from June 25 to July 5 is 10 days (since June 25 is day 0, June 26 is day 1, ..., July 5 is day 10). So the length is 10 days. So 10 days is within 10-20. But Admission Type is 'c' (Urgent), so doesn't qualify.

Wait, but the example answer was 1. Maybe there's a mistake in the data. Let me check the data again.

Looking at the data provided in the current task (the same as the example data?), but the example had an answer of 1. Wait, the example's data is the same as the current data. Wait, in the example, the answer was 1 for Male and Hypertension. Let's see: in the example data, respondent 97 has Medical Condition 'e' which is Hypertension, and Gender 'b' (Male). So that's the one. But in the current task, the question is different. The current task is about length of stay between 10-20 days and Elective admission.

Wait, but in the current data, perhaps there's a respondent that meets the criteria. Let me check again.

Wait, respondent 97's Admission Type is 'a' (Elective). Let's check their dates again. Admission Date: 2020-07-01, Discharge Date: 2020-03-05. That's impossible. So invalid. So no.

Respondent 88: Admission Type 'a' (Elective), discharge date 2023-07-02, admission 2023-06-08. Days: June 8 to July 2. June has 30 days. From June 8 to June 30: 23 days (30-8+1=23). July 1-2: 2 days. Total 25 days. So 25 days. Over 20. Exclude.

Respondent 117: Elective, 196 days. No.

So none of the respondents meet both criteria. But the example had an answer of 1. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the data. Let me check the data again.

Wait, looking at the data provided in the current task (after the example), the respondents are the same as in the example. So the example's answer was 1 for Male and Hypertension, which is respondent 97. But in the current task, the question is different. So perhaps there's a mistake in the data entry for discharge dates. For example, maybe respondent 97's discharge date is 2020-08-05 instead of 2020-03-05. If that were the case, the length of stay would be 35 days (July 1 to August 5). But since the data is as given, we can't assume that. So according to the given data, there are no respondents who meet the criteria. But that can't be right. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating.

Wait, let's check respondent 108's dates. Admission 2020-08-11, discharge 2020-07-20. Again, discharge before admission. So invalid.

So, according to the data provided, there are no respondents who have a length of stay between 10-20 days and Elective admission. But that seems unlikely. Maybe I missed someone. Let me check all respondents again.

Wait, respondent 117: Admission Type is 'a' (Elective). Admission Date: 2021-01-17, Discharge: 2021-07-31. The length is 196 days. Way over 20.

Respondent 88: Elective, 25 days. Over 20.

Respondent 97: Elective, but dates invalid.

So the answer would be 0. But the example had an answer of 1. But the current task is different. However, according to the data provided, there are no respondents meeting the criteria. But perhaps I made a mistake in date calculation.

Wait, let's take another approach. Let's use a date difference calculator. For example, respondent 88:

Admission: 2023-06-08
Discharge: 2023-07-02

Using a date calculator, the number of days between these two dates is 24 days (June 8 to July 2). So 24 days. Still over 20.

Respondent 136: 2023-06-25 to 2023-07-05: 10 days. But Admission Type is 'c' (Urgent). So no.

So no one meets the criteria. Therefore, the answer is 0. But maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again.

Alternatively, perhaps the task is to count those with length of stay between 10 and 20 days inclusive. So 10 to 20 days. Respondent 136 has 10 days, but Admission Type is Urgent. So no. Respondent 97's dates are invalid. So the answer is 0.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
How many respondents with Gender = 'Male' and Admission Type = 'Elective' have a Billing Amount below 30000?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking for the number of respondents who are Male, had an Elective admission type, and have a Billing Amount below 30,000. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The questions section defines each field. For Gender, the options are A. Female and B. Male. So, in the responses, a 'b' would indicate Male. Similarly, Admission Type is a MCQ with options A. Elective, B. Emergency, C. Urgent. So, 'a' in the response corresponds to Elective.

Now, looking at the responses section, there are seven respondents. Let's go through each one:

1. **Respondent 95**: Gender is 'a' (Female), so not Male. Skip.
2. **Respondent 80**: Gender is 'b' (Male). Admission Type is 'c' (Urgent). Billing Amount is 43282, which is above 30k. Doesn't meet all criteria.
3. **Respondent 84**: Gender 'b' (Male). Admission Type 'c' (Urgent). Billing 17993. So, even though billing is below 30k, admission type isn't Elective. Exclude.
4. **Respondent 146**: Gender 'a' (Female). Exclude.
5. **Respondent 22**: Gender 'b' (Male). Admission Type 'c' (Urgent). Billing 5998. Again, admission type is not Elective.
6. **Respondent 14**: Gender 'a' (Female). Exclude.
7. **Respondent 40**: Gender 'a' (Female). Exclude.

Wait, none of the Male respondents have Admission Type 'a' (Elective). Let me double-check each Male respondent:

- Respondent 80: Admission Type 'c' (Urgent)
- Respondent 84: Admission Type 'c' (Urgent)
- Respondent 22: Admission Type 'c' (Urgent)

So, none of the Male respondents have Elective admission. Therefore, the count is 0. But wait, let me check the Billing Amounts just in case. For example, if there was a Male with Elective but billing over 30k, but in this case, there are no Males with Elective at all. So the answer is 0.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the respondents whose length of stay is between 10 and 30 days and who were admitted for an 'Elective' procedure.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents whose length of stay is between 10 and 30 days and who were admitted for an 'Elective' procedure. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The questionnaire has a 'questions' section that defines each field. The 'Medical Condition' and 'Admission Type' are MCQs, so their answers are given as letters which need to be mapped to the corresponding options.

Looking at the 'Admission Type' question in the schema: [MCQ: A. Elective B. Emergency C. Urgent]. So, if a respondent's answer is 'a', that maps to 'Elective'. 

Next, the length of stay (LOS) isn't a direct field. I need to calculate it using the 'Date of Admission' and 'Discharge Date'. The LOS is the number of days between these two dates. The problem specifies that LOS should be between 10 and 30 days, inclusive.

Now, I'll go through each respondent in the 'responses' section:

1. **Respondent 13**:
   - Admission Date: 2020-05-31
   - Discharge Date: 2020-06-19
   - Calculate LOS: From May 31 to June 19. May has 31 days, so 1 day left in May (31-31=0, but since admission is on 31st, that's day 1). Then June 1 to June 19 is 19 days. Total LOS = 1 + 19 = 20 days.
   - Admission Type: 'b' which maps to 'Emergency'. So, this doesn't meet the 'Elective' criteria. Exclude.

2. **Respondent 21**:
   - Admission Date: 2021-11-13
   - Discharge Date: 2021-08-19
   - Wait, discharge date is before admission date? That's impossible. Maybe a typo. Let me check. The admission is 2021-11-13 and discharge is 2021-08-19. That's negative days. This must be an error in data entry. Since the discharge is before admission, LOS is negative, which doesn't make sense. So, this respondent's data is invalid. Exclude.

3. **Respondent 70**:
   - Admission Date: 2019-07-09
   - Discharge Date: 2019-09-01
   - Calculate LOS: From July 9 to July 31: 31 - 9 = 22 days in July. August has 31 days, plus September 1. Wait, discharge is on September 1, so from July 9 to September 1. July: 22 days (including 9th), August: 31 days, September 1: 1 day. Total: 22 + 31 +1 = 54 days. But wait, actually, from July 9 to September 1 is 54 days. However, LOS is 54 days, which is more than 30. So, exclude. Also, Admission Type is 'a' (Elective). But LOS is too long. So, no.

4. **Respondent 114**:
   - Admission Date: 2024-01-04
   - Discharge Date: 2023-11-08
   - Again, discharge is before admission. Another data error. LOS is negative. Exclude.

5. **Respondent 109**:
   - Admission Date: 2022-05-13
   - Discharge Date: 2022-06-10
   - Calculate LOS: May 13 to May 31: 19 days (including 13th). June 1 to June 10: 10 days. Total 29 days. LOS is 29 days. Admission Type is 'a' (Elective). So, meets both criteria. Count this one.

6. **Respondent 125**:
   - Admission Date: 2020-03-08
   - Discharge Date: 2020-02-12
   - Discharge is before admission. Negative LOS. Invalid. Exclude.

7. **Respondent 107**:
   - Admission Date: 2024-01-31
   - Discharge Date: 2024-02-02
   - LOS: From Jan 31 to Feb 2. Jan 31 is day 1, Feb 1 is day 2, Feb 2 is day 3. So 3 days. Less than 10. Admission Type is 'a' (Elective). Doesn't meet LOS criteria. Exclude.

So, only respondent 109 meets both conditions: Elective admission and LOS between 10-30 days. Therefore, the count is 1.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the respondents whose length of stay is between 5 and 35 days and who were admitted for an 'Emergency' procedure.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents whose length of stay is between 5 and 35 days and who were admitted for an 'Emergency' procedure. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The data is in XML format with a questions section and responses. The questions define the schema, and the responses contain the actual data from each respondent. 

Looking at the questions, the 'Admission Type' is an MCQ with options A. Elective, B. Emergency, C. Urgent. So, in the responses, if a respondent has 'b' for Admission Type, that maps to 'Emergency'. 

Next, the length of stay (LOS) isn't a direct field. I need to calculate it using the 'Date of Admission' and 'Discharge Date'. The LOS is the number of days between these two dates. The task requires LOS to be between 5 and 35 days, inclusive.

So, for each respondent, I need to:

1. Check if their Admission Type is 'Emergency' (i.e., answer 'b' for that question).
2. Calculate the LOS by subtracting the admission date from the discharge date.
3. Check if the LOS is ≥5 and ≤35.
4. Count how many respondents meet both conditions.

Now, let's go through each respondent in the responses:

**Respondent 56:**
- Admission Type: 'c' → Urgent (not Emergency)
- Skip.

**Respondent 132:**
- Admission Type: 'c' → Urgent. Skip.

**Respondent 30:**
- Admission Type: 'b' → Emergency. 
- Admission Date: 2023-05-24
- Discharge Date: 2023-06-15
Calculate LOS: From May 24 to June 15. May has 31 days, so 31 - 24 = 7 days in May, plus 15 in June → 22 days. 22 is between 5-35. Count this.

**Respondent 89:**
- Admission Type: 'b' → Emergency.
- Admission: 2022-10-18
- Discharge: 2022-11-11
October has 31 days. 31 - 18 = 13 days in Oct, plus 11 in Nov → 24 days. Count.

**Respondent 111:**
- Admission Type: 'b' → Emergency.
- Admission: 2022-03-12
- Discharge: 2022-06-24
Wait, March 12 to June 24. Let's calculate:
March: 31-12=19 (since March 12 is day 12, days remaining in March: 19)
April: 30 days
May: 31 days
June: 24 days
Total: 19 + 30 +31 +24 = 104 days. That's way over 35. Exclude.

**Respondent 29:**
- Admission Type: 'c' → Urgent. Skip.

**Respondent 73:**
- Admission Type: 'a' → Elective. Skip.

**Respondent 125:**
- Admission Type: 'a' → Elective. Skip.

**Respondent 135:**
- Admission Type: 'a' → Elective. Skip.

Wait, let me double-check the dates for respondent 30 and 89.

**Respondent 30:**
Admission: 2023-05-24 (May 24)
Discharge: 2023-06-15
May has 31 days. From May 24 to May 31: 7 days (since 31-24=7, but including the 24th? Wait, the LOS is discharge date minus admission date. So May 24 to May 25 is 1 day. So from 24th to 15th June: 

May 24 to May 31: 8 days (24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31)
Then June 1 to June 15: 15 days. Total 8+15=23 days. Yes, between 5-35.

**Respondent 89:**
Admission: 2022-10-18
Discharge: 2022-11-11
October 18 to October 31: 14 days (18th to 31st inclusive is 14 days)
November 1 to 11: 11 days. Total 25 days. Correct.

So respondents 30 and 89 meet both conditions. That's 2 respondents. Wait, but let me check again if I missed any others.

Wait, respondent 30 and 89 are the only ones with Admission Type 'b' (Emergency). The others with Admission Type 'b' are respondent 30, 89, and 111. But 111's LOS was 104 days, which is over 35. So only 30 and 89. So the count should be 2.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

How many respondents from 'HOSP_53' are over the age of 65 and are not taking 'Aspirin'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking for the number of respondents from 'HOSP_53' who are over 65 years old and not taking 'Aspirin'. 

First, I need to look at the data provided. The responses are in XML format, with each respondent having various answers. Let's start by identifying all respondents from HOSP_53. 

Looking through the <responses> section, each respondent has a <answer question=""Hospital"">. I need to check which of these have the value 'HOSP_53'. Let me go through each respondent one by one.

Respondent id=""12"": Hospital is HOSP_12. Not HOSP_53.
Respondent id=""57"": Hospital is HOSP_57. No.
Respondent id=""102"": HOSP_102. Nope.
Respondent id=""15"": HOSP_15. Not our target.
Respondent id=""2"": HOSP_02. Still no.
Respondent id=""53"": Here, the Hospital is HOSP_53. Got one. Let's note this respondent's details.
Respondent id=""78"": HOSP_78. Not it.
Respondent id=""55"": HOSP_55. No.
Respondent id=""36"": HOSP_36. No.

So only respondent 53 is from HOSP_53. Now, check their age. The Age for respondent 53 is 38. Wait, 38 is not over 65. So even though they are from HOSP_53, they don't meet the age requirement. 

But wait, maybe I missed other respondents? Let me double-check. The list of respondents ends at id 36. There's no other respondent with HOSP_53. So the only one from HOSP_53 is 53, but their age is 38. 

Therefore, there are zero respondents from HOSP_53 over 65. But let's confirm if there's any other respondent in HOSP_53. The data shows only respondent 53 is in HOSP_53, and their age is 38. 

Additionally, even if there were others, we need to check if they are not taking Aspirin. The Medication for respondent 53 is 'b', which maps to Ibuprofen (from the Medication question options: A. Aspirin B. Ibuprofen etc.). So they are not taking Aspirin, but their age is under 65. 

Since there are no respondents from HOSP_53 over 65, the count is zero.

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

How many respondents from 'HOSP_34' are over the age of 50 and are not taking 'Aspirin'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking how many respondents from 'HOSP_34' are over the age of 50 and are not taking 'Aspirin'. 

First, I need to look at the data provided. The responses are in XML format, with each respondent having various answers. Let me start by identifying all respondents from 'HOSP_34'. 

Looking through the <responses> section, I'll check each respondent's 'Hospital' answer. The hospital is given as an open-ended response, so I need to look for the exact text 'HOSP_34'. 

Scanning the respondents:
- Respondent 75: Hospital is HOSP_75
- Respondent 84: HOSP_84
- Respondent 31: HOSP_31
- Respondent 2: HOSP_02
- Respondent 128: HOSP_128
- Respondent 111: HOSP_111
- Respondent 45: HOSP_45
- Respondent 34: HOSP_34 (found here)
- Respondent 98: HOSP_98

So only respondent 34 is from HOSP_34. Now, check their age. The age for respondent 34 is 20. The question requires the age to be over 50. Since 20 is not over 50, this respondent doesn't meet the age criteria. 

But wait, maybe I missed other respondents? Let me double-check. No, the list above shows only respondent 34 is in HOSP_34. 

Next, even if there were others, the age here is 20, which is under 50. So even if they weren't taking Aspirin, they wouldn't count. 

But let's also check the medication part. The 'Medication' is an MCQ. The options are A. Aspirin, B. Ibuprofen, C. Lipitor, D. Paracetamol, E. Penicillin. Respondent 34's medication is 'd', which maps to Paracetamol. So they are not taking Aspirin. 

However, since the age is 20, which is under 50, this respondent doesn't meet both criteria. Therefore, there are zero respondents from HOSP_34 over 50 and not taking Aspirin. 

Wait, but maybe there's another respondent in HOSP_34 that I missed? Let me check again. No, the data only has one respondent (34) in HOSP_34. 

So the answer should be 0.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
How many respondents with Gender = 'Male' and Admission Type = 'Emergency' have a Billing Amount below 40000?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking for the number of respondents who are Male, had an Emergency admission type, and have a Billing Amount below 40,000. 

First, I need to understand the structure of the data provided. The dataset includes a list of respondents, each with various answers to different questions. The questions section defines each question, including the possible answers for MCQs. 

Starting with the Gender: the question is a MCQ where option B is Male. So any respondent with an answer 'b' (case-insensitive) in the Gender field is Male.

Next, Admission Type: the options are A. Elective, B. Emergency, C. Urgent. So, looking for respondents who answered 'b' here, which maps to Emergency.

Then, Billing Amount is an open-ended question, so the value is a number. We need to check if this number is less than 40,000.

Now, I'll go through each respondent in the responses section and check these three conditions.

Looking at respondent 129: Gender is 'a' (Female), so not Male. Skip.

Respondent 144: Gender 'a' (Female). Skip.

Respondent 91: Gender 'a' (Female). Skip.

Respondent 19: Gender 'a' (Female). Skip.

Respondent 102: Gender 'b' (Male). Admission Type is 'b' (Emergency). Billing Amount is 18856, which is below 40k. So this one counts.

Respondent 11: Gender 'b' (Male). Admission Type 'b' (Emergency). Billing Amount is 43, which is way below 40k. Count this one.

Respondent 112: Gender 'a' (Female). Skip.

Respondent 5: Gender 'a' (Female). Skip.

So, respondents 102 and 11 meet all three criteria. That's a total of 2.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose length of stay is between 10 and 40 days and who were admitted for an 'Urgent' procedure.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents whose length of stay is between 10 and 40 days and who were admitted for an 'Urgent' procedure. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The dataset has a 'questions' section that defines each field. The 'Medical Condition' and 'Admission Type' are MCQs, so their answers are given as letters which need to be mapped to their corresponding options. The 'Date of Admission' and 'Discharge Date' are open-ended, so their values are dates in the format YYYY-MM-DD.

The key steps here are:
1. Calculate the length of stay for each respondent by finding the difference between the discharge date and admission date.
2. Check if the length of stay is between 10 and 40 days (inclusive).
3. Verify if the admission type is 'Urgent', which corresponds to option C in the MCQ.

Looking at the Admission Type question in the schema: [MCQ: A. Elective B. Emergency C. Urgent]. So, any respondent with an answer 'c' (case-insensitive) for Admission Type is considered Urgent.

Now, I need to go through each respondent in the responses section and check these two conditions.

Let's list out each respondent and their relevant data:

Respondent 20:
- Admission Date: 2023-05-12
- Discharge Date: 2023-08-11
- Admission Type: a (Elective)
Calculate LOS: From May 12 to August 11. Let's compute the days. May has 31 days, so from May 12 to May 31: 20 days. June: 30, July:31, August 11: 11. Total: 20+30+31+11 = 92 days. That's way over 40, so no.

Respondent 81:
- Admission: 2019-06-02
- Discharge: 2019-07-29
- Admission Type: b (Emergency)
LOS: June has 30 days, so from June 2 to June 30: 29 days. July 29: 29 days. Total 29+29=58 days. Over 40. Not eligible.

Respondent 148:
- Admission: 2023-08-17
- Discharge: 2023-10-12
- Admission Type: c (Urgent)
Calculate LOS: August 17 to August 31: 15 days. September:30, October 12:12. Total 15+30+12=57 days. Over 40. Doesn't meet.

Respondent 110:
- Admission: 2019-12-12
- Discharge: 2019-08-21. Wait, this discharge date is before admission date? That can't be right. Maybe a typo? Let me check. The admission is 2019-12-12 and discharge 2019-08-21. That's impossible, so perhaps the dates are swapped. Maybe discharge is 2019-12-21? But the data is as given. If the discharge is before admission, the LOS would be negative, which doesn't make sense. Maybe it's a data entry error, but according to the data, the LOS would be negative, so we can't count this. So skip this respondent.

Respondent 147:
- Admission: 2021-05-06
- Discharge: 2021-06-06
- Admission Type: b (Emergency)
LOS: May 6 to June 6 is 31 days (since May has 31 days). 31 days is within 10-40. But Admission Type is Emergency (B), not Urgent. So doesn't meet.

Respondent 104:
- Admission: 2019-11-03
- Discharge: 2019-11-23
- Admission Type: a (Elective)
LOS: 20 days. But Admission Type is Elective. So no.

Respondent 107:
- Admission: 2024-01-31
- Discharge: 2024-02-02
- Admission Type: a (Elective)
LOS: 2 days (31 Jan to 2 Feb). Only 2 days. Below 10. Doesn't qualify.

Respondent 75:
- Admission: 2021-02-12
- Discharge: 2021-01-26. Again, discharge before admission. Negative LOS. Data error. Skip.

Respondent 30:
- Admission: 2023-05-24
- Discharge: 2023-06-15
- Admission Type: b (Emergency)
LOS: From May 24 to May 31: 8 days. June 1-15:15 days. Total 23 days. Within 10-40. But Admission Type is Emergency. So no.

Respondent 6:
- Admission: 2022-09-19
- Discharge: 2022-08-10. Again, discharge before admission. Negative LOS. Data error. Skip.

Respondent 84:
- Admission: 2020-01-27
- Discharge: 2020-05-13
- Admission Type: c (Urgent)
Calculate LOS: January 27 to January 31: 5 days. February (2020 is a leap year):29 days. March:31, April:30, May 13:13. Total:5+29=34, +31=65, +30=95, +13=108 days. Over 40. So no.

Respondent 44:
- Admission: 2020-10-24
- Discharge: 2020-11-13
- Admission Type: a (Elective)
LOS: From Oct 24 to Oct 31: 8 days. November 13:13. Total 21 days. But Admission Type is Elective. Doesn't meet.

Now, let's check if I missed any. Wait, the respondents with Admission Type 'c' (Urgent) are:

Looking through each:

Respondent 148: Admission Type c (Urgent), but LOS 57 days. No.

Respondent 84: Admission Type c (Urgent), LOS 108 days. No.

Any others? Let me check again.

Wait, respondent 75: Admission Type c? Let me check. Respondent 75's Admission Type is c. Wait, in the data:

<respondent id=""75"">
...
<answer question=""Admission Type"">c</answer>
...
</respondent>

Yes. So Admission Type is c (Urgent). Let's recalculate their LOS.

Admission Date: 2021-02-12
Discharge Date: 2021-01-26. Again, discharge is before admission. Negative. So invalid. So even though Admission Type is Urgent, the LOS is invalid. So we can't count this.

So, are there any respondents with Admission Type Urgent and LOS between 10-40 days?

Looking again:

Wait, maybe I missed someone. Let's check all respondents again.

Looking at each respondent:

1. Respondent 20: Elective, LOS 92
2. 81: Emergency, 58
3. 148: Urgent, 57
4. 110: Elective, invalid dates
5. 147: Emergency, 31
6. 104: Elective, 20
7. 107: Elective, 2
8. 75: Urgent, invalid dates
9. 30: Emergency, 23
10. 6: invalid dates
11. 84: Urgent, 108
12. 44: Elective, 21

So the only respondents with Admission Type Urgent (c) are 148, 75, 84. But their LOS are 57, invalid, 108. None of them have LOS between 10-40. Therefore, the count is zero.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again.

Wait, respondent 30: Admission Type is b (Emergency), LOS 23. Not Urgent.

Respondent 44: Admission Type a (Elective), LOS 21.

So, no one meets both criteria. Therefore, the answer is 0.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the respondents who are in a hospital where the number of patients with Arthritis is greater than the number of patients with Asthma.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents who are in a hospital where the number of patients with Arthritis is greater than the number of patients with Asthma. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The data is in XML format with a list of respondents, each having answers to various questions, including their medical condition and the hospital they're in. 

The key here is to group the respondents by their hospital and then count how many in each hospital have Arthritis versus Asthma. Then, for each hospital, if the count of Arthritis is higher than Asthma, all respondents in that hospital should be counted.

Let me start by going through each respondent and noting their hospital and medical condition. 

Looking at the data:

- Respondent 93: Hospital HOSP_93, Medical Condition 'a' (Arthritis)
- Respondent 23: HOSP_23, 'b' (Asthma)
- Respondent 112: HOSP_112, 'c' (Cancer)
- Respondent 28: HOSP_28, 'd' (Diabetes)
- Respondent 63: HOSP_63, 'c' (Cancer)
- Respondent 103: HOSP_103, 'f' (Obesity)
- Respondent 135: HOSP_135, 'b' (Asthma)
- Respondent 21: HOSP_21, 'a' (Arthritis)
- Respondent 102: HOSP_102, 'e' (Hypertension)
- Respondent 80: HOSP_80, 'c' (Cancer)
- Respondent 87: HOSP_87, 'd' (Diabetes)
- Respondent 57: HOSP_57, 'd' (Diabetes)

Now, let's group by hospital and count Arthritis (A) and Asthma (B) cases:

- HOSP_93: 1 Arthritis, 0 Asthma
- HOSP_23: 0 Arthritis, 1 Asthma
- HOSP_112: 0, 0 (Cancer)
- HOSP_28: 0, 0 (Diabetes)
- HOSP_63: 0, 0 (Cancer)
- HOSP_103: 0, 0 (Obesity)
- HOSP_135: 0, 1 Asthma
- HOSP_21: 1 Arthritis, 0 Asthma
- HOSP_102: 0, 0 (Hypertension)
- HOSP_80: 0, 0 (Cancer)
- HOSP_87: 0, 0 (Diabetes)
- HOSP_57: 0, 0 (Diabetes)

Now, check which hospitals have more Arthritis than Asthma:

- HOSP_93: 1 vs 0 → yes
- HOSP_21: 1 vs 0 → yes

Other hospitals either have equal, more Asthma, or none of both.

Now, count the number of respondents in these hospitals:

Looking back at the respondents:

- HOSP_93 has respondent 93 → 1 person
- HOSP_21 has respondent 21 → 1 person

So total respondents in qualifying hospitals: 1 + 1 = 2.

Wait, but let me double-check. Are there any other hospitals I missed? Let me go through each respondent again to confirm their hospital and condition.

Yes, the only hospitals with Arthritis cases are HOSP_93 and HOSP_21, each with 1 case. Neither has any Asthma cases. So both hospitals qualify. Each has one respondent. So total is 2.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
How many respondents have a Billing Amount that is higher than the average Billing Amount for their Admission Type?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking how many respondents have a Billing Amount higher than the average Billing Amount for their respective Admission Types. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The dataset has a 'questions' section that defines each field. The 'Billing Amount' is an open-ended question, so the responses are numerical values. The 'Admission Type' is an MCQ with options A. Elective, B. Emergency, C. Urgent. Each respondent's answers are in the 'responses' section.

The plan is to:

1. Calculate the average Billing Amount for each Admission Type (Elective, Emergency, Urgent).
2. For each respondent, compare their Billing Amount to the average of their Admission Type.
3. Count how many have a Billing Amount higher than their group's average.

First, I'll go through each respondent and note their Admission Type and Billing Amount. Then, group them by Admission Type to compute the average for each group. After that, check each individual's Billing Amount against their group's average and count the ones that are higher.

Let's start by extracting all respondents' Admission Types and Billing Amounts.

Looking at the data:

Respondent 44: Admission Type 'a' (Elective), Billing Amount 48407
Respondent 20: Admission Type 'a' (Elective), Billing Amount -503
Respondent 131: Admission Type 'a' (Elective), Billing Amount 14238
Respondent 30: Admission Type 'b' (Emergency), Billing Amount 10301
Respondent 136: Admission Type 'c' (Urgent), Billing Amount 4398
Respondent 50: Admission Type 'a' (Elective), Billing Amount 5517
Respondent 90: Admission Type 'c' (Urgent), Billing Amount 25230
Respondent 38: Admission Type 'c' (Urgent), Billing Amount 8409
Respondent 61: Admission Type 'a' (Elective), Billing Amount 23500
Respondent 27: Admission Type 'b' (Emergency), Billing Amount 30591

Now, group them by Admission Type:

Elective (a):
- 44: 48407
- 20: -503
- 131: 14238
- 50: 5517
- 61: 23500

Emergency (b):
- 30: 10301
- 27: 30591

Urgent (c):
- 136: 4398
- 90: 25230
- 38: 8409

Next, calculate the average for each group.

Elective group:
Sum = 48407 + (-503) + 14238 + 5517 + 23500
Let's compute that step by step:
48407 - 503 = 47904
47904 + 14238 = 62142
62142 + 5517 = 67659
67659 + 23500 = 91159
Average = 91159 / 5 = 18231.8

Emergency group:
Sum = 10301 + 30591 = 40892
Average = 40892 / 2 = 20446

Urgent group:
Sum = 4398 + 25230 + 8409 = 38037
Average = 38037 / 3 = 12679

Now, compare each respondent's Billing Amount to their group's average.

Elective group:
- 44: 48407 > 18231.8 → Yes
- 20: -503 < 18231.8 → No
- 131: 14238 < 18231.8 → No
- 50: 5517 < 18231.8 → No
- 61: 23500 > 18231.8 → Yes
So, 2 in Elective.

Emergency group:
- 30: 10301 < 20446 → No
- 27: 30591 > 20446 → Yes
So, 1 in Emergency.

Urgent group:
- 136: 4398 < 12679 → No
- 90: 25230 > 12679 → Yes
- 38: 8409 < 12679 → No
So, 1 in Urgent.

Total respondents meeting the condition: 2 (Elective) + 1 (Emergency) + 1 (Urgent) = 4.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the respondents who are in a hospital where the number of patients with Asthma is greater than the number of patients with Arthritis.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents who are in a hospital where the number of patients with Asthma is greater than the number of patients with Arthritis. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The dataset has a list of respondents, each with various answers, including their hospital and medical condition. The medical condition is an MCQ where option B is Asthma and option A is Arthritis. The hospitals are identified by names like HOSP_66, HOSP_51, etc.

So, the plan is to:

1. Group all respondents by their hospital.
2. For each hospital, count how many have Asthma (Medical Condition B) and how many have Arthritis (Medical Condition A).
3. For hospitals where Asthma count > Arthritis count, count all respondents in those hospitals.

Let's start by going through each respondent and mapping their hospital to their medical condition.

Looking at the respondents:

- Respondent 66: Hospital HOSP_66, Medical Condition B (Asthma)
- Respondent 51: HOSP_51, Medical Condition B (Asthma)
- Respondent 45: HOSP_45, Medical Condition F (Obesity)
- Respondent 40: HOSP_40, Medical Condition B (Asthma)
- Respondent 20: HOSP_20, Medical Condition B (Asthma)
- Respondent 46: HOSP_46, Medical Condition A (Arthritis)
- Respondent 127: HOSP_127, Medical Condition B (Asthma)

Now, group by hospital:

HOSP_66:
- 1 Asthma (B)

HOSP_51:
- 1 Asthma (B)

HOSP_45:
- 1 Obesity (F)

HOSP_40:
- 1 Asthma (B)

HOSP_20:
- 1 Asthma (B)

HOSP_46:
- 1 Arthritis (A)

HOSP_127:
- 1 Asthma (B)

Now, for each hospital, compare Asthma and Arthritis counts:

HOSP_66: Asthma=1, Arthritis=0 → 1>0 → include
HOSP_51: Asthma=1, Arthritis=0 → include
HOSP_45: Asthma=0, Arthritis=0 → not
HOSP_40: Asthma=1, Arthritis=0 → include
HOSP_20: Asthma=1, Arthritis=0 → include
HOSP_46: Asthma=0, Arthritis=1 → not
HOSP_127: Asthma=1, Arthritis=0 → include

So the hospitals that meet the condition are HOSP_66, HOSP_51, HOSP_40, HOSP_20, HOSP_127. Each of these has 1 respondent except maybe some have more? Wait, but looking back, each hospital in the data has only one respondent. For example, HOSP_66 has only respondent 66. Similarly, each hospital is listed once per respondent. So each hospital in the data has exactly one patient (respondent) listed. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, let me check again.

Looking at the data:

Each respondent has a unique hospital. For example, respondent 66 is in HOSP_66, 51 in HOSP_51, etc. So each hospital here has only one patient in the dataset. Therefore, for each hospital, the count of Asthma is either 1 or 0, and same for Arthritis.

So in the hospitals where the respondent has Asthma (B), the count for Asthma is 1, Arthritis is 0. So all those hospitals (HOSP_66, 51,40,20,127) have Asthma count 1, Arthritis 0. So 1>0, so they qualify. The only hospital with Arthritis is HOSP_46 (respondent 46 has A), so there Asthma is 0, Arthritis 1. HOSP_45 has F, so both counts are 0.

Therefore, the hospitals that qualify are HOSP_66, 51,40,20,127. Each of these has 1 respondent. So total respondents in these hospitals is 5.

Wait, but let me count again:

HOSP_66: 1
HOSP_51:1
HOSP_40:1
HOSP_20:1
HOSP_127:1
Total 5.

So the answer should be 5.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

How many respondents have a Billing Amount that is higher than the average Billing Amount for their Admission Type?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem. The question is asking how many respondents have a Billing Amount higher than the average for their Admission Type. Hmm, so first, I need to figure out the average billing amount for each admission type, then compare each respondent's billing amount to their respective admission type's average.

First, let's look at the data structure. The Admission Type is an MCQ with options A. Elective, B. Emergency, C. Urgent. Each respondent's answer is a code (a, b, c). The Billing Amount is an open-ended number.

So, step 1: Group all respondents by their Admission Type. For each group (Elective, Emergency, Urgent), calculate the average billing amount.

Step 2: For each respondent, check if their Billing Amount is greater than the average of their Admission Type group.

Step 3: Count how many respondents meet this condition.

Let me start by extracting all the respondents and their Admission Type and Billing Amount.

Looking at the responses:

Respondent 145: Admission Type 'c' (Urgent), Billing Amount 46430
Respondent 149: Admission Type 'b' (Emergency), 33211
Respondent 115: Admission Type 'c' (Urgent), 40693
Respondent 83: Admission Type 'c' (Urgent), 25966
Respondent 81: Admission Type 'b' (Emergency), 14681
Respondent 39: Admission Type 'c' (Urgent), 45453
Respondent 113: Admission Type 'a' (Elective), 19328
Respondent 18: Admission Type 'b' (Emergency), 12263
Respondent 121: Admission Type 'b' (Emergency), 50119
Respondent 114: Admission Type 'a' (Elective), 20258
Respondent 78: Admission Type 'c' (Urgent), 23068
Respondent 71: Admission Type 'a' (Elective), 31486

Now, group them by Admission Type:

Elective (a):
- Respondent 113: 19328
- Respondent 114: 20258
- Respondent 71: 31486

Emergency (b):
- Respondent 149: 33211
- Respondent 81: 14681
- Respondent 18: 12263
- Respondent 121: 50119

Urgent (c):
- Respondent 145: 46430
- Respondent 115: 40693
- Respondent 83: 25966
- Respondent 39: 45453
- Respondent 78: 23068

Next, calculate the average for each group.

Elective average:
19328 + 20258 + 31486 = 71072
Divide by 3: 71072 / 3 ≈ 23690.67

Emergency average:
33211 + 14681 + 12263 + 50119 = 110,274
Divide by 4: 110274 / 4 = 27568.5

Urgent average:
46430 + 40693 + 25966 + 45453 + 23068 = 181,610
Divide by 5: 181610 / 5 = 36,322

Now, compare each respondent's billing amount to their group's average.

Elective group:
- 113: 19328 vs 23690.67 → 19328 < 23690.67 → No
- 114: 20258 < 23690.67 → No
- 71: 31486 > 23690.67 → Yes

Emergency group:
- 149: 33211 > 27568.5 → Yes
- 81: 14681 < 27568.5 → No
- 18: 12263 < 27568.5 → No
- 121: 50119 > 27568.5 → Yes

Urgent group:
- 145: 46430 > 36322 → Yes
- 115: 40693 > 36322 → Yes
- 83: 25966 < 36322 → No
- 39: 45453 > 36322 → Yes
- 78: 23068 < 36322 → No

Now count the ""Yes"" cases:

Elective: 1 (71)
Emergency: 2 (149, 121)
Urgent: 3 (145, 115, 39)

Total: 1 + 2 + 3 = 6

Wait, let me check again. Let me recount:

Elective group: 1 (respondent 71)
Emergency group: 149 (33,211 > 27,568.5 → yes), 121 (50,119 > 27,568.5 → yes) → 2
Urgent group: 145 (46,430 > 36,322 → yes), 115 (40,693 > 36,322 → yes), 39 (45,453 > 36,322 → yes) → 3

Total yes: 1+2+3=6. So the answer should be 6.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

How many respondents have a Billing Amount that is higher than the average Billing Amount for their Admission Type?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking for the number of respondents whose Billing Amount is higher than the average Billing Amount for their respective Admission Type. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The Admission Type is an MCQ with options A. Elective, B. Emergency, C. Urgent. Each respondent has an Admission Type answer, which is a letter code (a, b, c). The Billing Amount is an open-ended numerical value.

So, the plan is:

1. **Calculate the average Billing Amount for each Admission Type.**
   - For each Admission Type (Elective, Emergency, Urgent), compute the average of all Billing Amounts in that category.

2. **Compare each respondent's Billing Amount to their Admission Type's average.**
   - For each respondent, check if their Billing Amount is greater than the average of their Admission Type group.

3. **Count how many respondents meet this condition.**

Let's start by extracting the necessary data from the responses. Looking at the provided data:

**Respondents and their Admission Types and Billing Amounts:**

- Respondent 91: Admission Type 'a' (Elective), Billing Amount 26787
- Respondent 130: Admission Type 'a' (Elective), Billing Amount 34618
- Respondent 19: Admission Type 'b' (Emergency), Billing Amount 10352
- Respondent 80: Admission Type 'c' (Urgent), Billing Amount 43282
- Respondent 119: Admission Type 'a' (Elective), Billing Amount 6768

Wait, but there are only 5 respondents here. Let me check again. Yes, the responses section lists 5 respondents with IDs 91, 130, 19, 80, 119.

Now, group them by Admission Type:

**Elective (a):**
- 91: 26787
- 130: 34618
- 119: 6768

**Emergency (b):**
- 19: 10352

**Urgent (c):**
- 80: 43282

Next, calculate the average for each group.

**Elective Average:**
Sum = 26787 + 34618 + 6768 = 26787 + 34618 = 61405; 61405 + 6768 = 68173
Average = 68173 / 3 ≈ 22724.33

**Emergency Average:**
Only one respondent: 10352. So average is 10352.

**Urgent Average:**
Only one respondent: 43282. Average is 43282.

Now, compare each respondent's Billing Amount to their group's average:

- **Respondent 91 (Elective):** 26787 vs 22724.33 → 26787 > 22724.33 → Yes
- **Respondent 130 (Elective):** 34618 > 22724.33 → Yes
- **Respondent 119 (Elective):** 6768 < 22724.33 → No
- **Respondent 19 (Emergency):** 10352 = 10352 → Not higher → No
- **Respondent 80 (Urgent):** 43282 = 43282 → Not higher → No

So, the respondents who meet the condition are 91 and 130. That's 2 respondents.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations. For Elective, the sum is 26787 + 34618 = 61405, plus 6768 is 68173. Divided by 3, that's 22724.33. Correct. So 91 and 130 are above average. Respondent 119 is below. The other two are exactly the average (since they are the only ones in their groups), so they don't count. Therefore, the total is 2.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the respondents who are in a hospital where the number of patients with Obesity is greater than the number of patients with Arthritis.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents who are in a hospital where the number of patients with Obesity is greater than the number of patients with Arthritis. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The data has a list of respondents, each with various answers, including their hospital and medical condition. The medical conditions are given as MCQ options, so I need to map the answer codes to their corresponding conditions.

Looking at the questions section, the ""Medical Condition"" question has options: A. Arthritis, B. Asthma, C. Cancer, D. Diabetes, E. Hypertension, F. Obesity. So, any answer with 'f' in the medical condition corresponds to Obesity, and 'a' corresponds to Arthritis.

Next, I need to group the respondents by their hospital. Each respondent has a ""Hospital"" answer, like HOSP_10, HOSP_15, etc. For each hospital, I need to count how many patients have Obesity (F) and how many have Arthritis (A).

Once I have the counts for each hospital, I can determine which hospitals have more Obesity cases than Arthritis. Then, I need to count all respondents who are in those hospitals.

Let me go through each respondent and categorize them by hospital and medical condition.

Starting with respondent 10:
- Hospital: HOSP_10
- Medical Condition: 'b' → Asthma. Not relevant for Obesity or Arthritis.

Respondent 15:
- HOSP_15
- Medical Condition: 'a' → Arthritis. So, Arthritis count for HOSP_15 increases by 1.

Respondent 95:
- HOSP_95
- Medical Condition: 'e' → Hypertension. Not relevant.

Respondent 74:
- HOSP_74
- Medical Condition: 'a' → Arthritis. Arthritis count for HOSP_74 increases by 1.

Respondent 20:
- HOSP_20
- Medical Condition: 'b' → Asthma. Not relevant.

Respondent 24:
- HOSP_24
- Medical Condition: 'd' → Diabetes. Not relevant.

Respondent 130:
- HOSP_130
- Medical Condition: 'd' → Diabetes. Not relevant.

Respondent 99:
- HOSP_99
- Medical Condition: 'f' → Obesity. Obesity count for HOSP_99 increases by 1.

Respondent 119:
- HOSP_119
- Medical Condition: 'f' → Obesity. Obesity count for HOSP_119 increases by 1.

Respondent 149:
- HOSP_149
- Medical Condition: 'f' → Obesity. Obesity count for HOSP_149 increases by 1.

Respondent 142:
- HOSP_142
- Medical Condition: 'b' → Asthma. Not relevant.

Respondent 11:
- HOSP_11
- Medical Condition: 'e' → Hypertension. Not relevant.

Wait, let me check again. Let me list all hospitals and count Obesity and Arthritis per hospital.

HOSP_10:
- Respondent 10: Medical Condition 'b' (Asthma)
→ Obesity: 0, Arthritis: 0

HOSP_15:
- Respondent 15: 'a' (Arthritis)
→ Obesity: 0, Arthritis: 1

HOSP_95:
- Respondent 95: 'e' (Hypertension)
→ Obesity: 0, Arthritis: 0

HOSP_74:
- Respondent 74: 'a' (Arthritis)
→ Obesity: 0, Arthritis: 1

HOSP_20:
- Respondent 20: 'b' (Asthma)
→ Obesity: 0, Arthritis: 0

HOSP_24:
- Respondent 24: 'd' (Diabetes)
→ Obesity: 0, Arthritis: 0

HOSP_130:
- Respondent 130: 'd' (Diabetes)
→ Obesity: 0, Arthritis: 0

HOSP_99:
- Respondent 99: 'f' (Obesity)
→ Obesity: 1, Arthritis: 0

HOSP_119:
- Respondent 119: 'f' (Obesity)
→ Obesity: 1, Arthritis: 0

HOSP_149:
- Respondent 149: 'f' (Obesity)
→ Obesity: 1, Arthritis: 0

HOSP_142:
- Respondent 142: 'b' (Asthma)
→ Obesity: 0, Arthritis: 0

HOSP_11:
- Respondent 11: 'e' (Hypertension)
→ Obesity: 0, Arthritis: 0

Wait, but are there any other respondents in the same hospitals? Let me check all respondents again to ensure I didn't miss any. The list provided has 12 respondents. Let me check each one's hospital and medical condition again.

Respondent 10: HOSP_10, 'b' (Asthma)
Respondent 15: HOSP_15, 'a' (Arthritis)
Respondent 95: HOSP_95, 'e' (Hypertension)
Respondent 74: HOSP_74, 'a' (Arthritis)
Respondent 20: HOSP_20, 'b' (Asthma)
Respondent 24: HOSP_24, 'd' (Diabetes)
Respondent 130: HOSP_130, 'd' (Diabetes)
Respondent 99: HOSP_99, 'f' (Obesity)
Respondent 119: HOSP_119, 'f' (Obesity)
Respondent 149: HOSP_149, 'f' (Obesity)
Respondent 142: HOSP_142, 'b' (Asthma)
Respondent 11: HOSP_11, 'e' (Hypertension)

So each hospital listed here has only one respondent. Therefore, for each hospital:

HOSP_15: Arthritis 1, Obesity 0 → Obesity (0) not greater than Arthritis (1)
HOSP_74: Arthritis 1, Obesity 0 → same
HOSP_99: Obesity 1, Arthritis 0 → Obesity > Arthritis (1 > 0)
HOSP_119: Obesity 1, Arthritis 0 → same
HOSP_149: Obesity 1, Arthritis 0 → same

The other hospitals have 0 for both or other conditions. So the hospitals where Obesity count > Arthritis count are HOSP_99, HOSP_119, HOSP_149.

Now, count the number of respondents in these hospitals. Each of these hospitals has one respondent each. So total respondents in these hospitals are 3 (from HOSP_99, HOSP_119, HOSP_149).

Therefore, the answer should be 3.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
How many respondents have a Billing Amount that is higher than the average Billing Amount for their Admission Type?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking for the number of respondents whose Billing Amount is higher than the average Billing Amount for their respective Admission Type. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The Admission Type is an MCQ with options A. Elective, B. Emergency, C. Urgent. Each respondent has an Admission Type answer, which is a letter code (a, b, c). The Billing Amount is an open-ended numerical value.

So, the plan is:

1. **Calculate the average Billing Amount for each Admission Type.**
   - Group all respondents by their Admission Type.
   - For each group, compute the average of their Billing Amounts.

2. **Compare each respondent's Billing Amount to their Admission Type's average.**
   - For each respondent, check if their Billing Amount is greater than the average of their group.

3. **Count how many respondents meet this condition.**

Let's start by extracting the Admission Type and Billing Amount for each respondent. Then, compute the averages.

Looking at the data:

**Respondents and their Admission Type (mapped to text) and Billing Amount:**

- Respondent 147: Admission Type B (Emergency), Billing 25250
- Respondent 49: Admission Type A (Elective), Billing 25302
- Respondent 83: Admission Type C (Urgent), Billing 25966
- Respondent 122: Admission Type B (Emergency), Billing 48996
- Respondent 129: Admission Type A (Elective), Billing 30358
- Respondent 39: Admission Type C (Urgent), Billing 45453
- Respondent 16: Admission Type C (Urgent), Billing 36992
- Respondent 116: Admission Type C (Urgent), Billing 40015
- Respondent 27: Admission Type B (Emergency), Billing 30591
- Respondent 88: Admission Type A (Elective), Billing 39616
- Respondent 22: Admission Type C (Urgent), Billing 5998
- Respondent 130: Admission Type A (Elective), Billing 34618

Now, group them by Admission Type:

**Elective (A):**
- 49: 25302
- 129: 30358
- 88: 39616
- 130: 34618

**Emergency (B):**
- 147: 25250
- 122: 48996
- 27: 30591

**Urgent (C):**
- 83: 25966
- 39: 45453
- 16: 36992
- 116: 40015
- 22: 5998

Next, calculate the average for each group:

**Elective Average:**
Sum = 25302 + 30358 + 39616 + 34618 = 129,894
Count = 4
Average = 129,894 / 4 = 32,473.5

**Emergency Average:**
Sum = 25250 + 48996 + 30591 = 104,837
Count = 3
Average = 104,837 / 3 ≈ 34,945.67

**Urgent Average:**
Sum = 25966 + 45453 + 36992 + 40015 + 5998 = 154,424
Count = 5
Average = 154,424 / 5 = 30,884.8

Now, check each respondent against their group's average:

**Elective Group:**
- 49: 25,302 < 32,473.5 → No
- 129: 30,358 < 32,473.5 → No
- 88: 39,616 > 32,473.5 → Yes
- 130: 34,618 > 32,473.5 → Yes
Total in Elective: 2

**Emergency Group:**
- 147: 25,250 < 34,945.67 → No
- 122: 48,996 > 34,945.67 → Yes
- 27: 30,591 < 34,945.67 → No
Total in Emergency: 1

**Urgent Group:**
- 83: 25,966 < 30,884.8 → No
- 39: 45,453 > 30,884.8 → Yes
- 16: 36,992 > 30,884.8 → Yes
- 116: 40,015 > 30,884.8 → Yes
- 22: 5,998 < 30,884.8 → No
Total in Urgent: 3

Adding them up: 2 (Elective) + 1 (Emergency) + 3 (Urgent) = 6 respondents.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the respondents who are in a hospital where the number of patients with Cancer is greater than the number of patients with Diabetes.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents who are in a hospital where the number of patients with Cancer is greater than the number of patients with Diabetes. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The data has a list of respondents, each with various answers, including their hospital and medical condition. The hospitals are identified by codes like HOSP_11, HOSP_64, etc. Each respondent's medical condition is given as a code (a, b, c, d, e, f) which corresponds to specific conditions as per the questions section.

Looking at the questions, the Medical Condition question has options: A. Arthritis, B. Asthma, C. Cancer, D. Diabetes, E. Hypertension, F. Obesity. So, the code 'c' corresponds to Cancer and 'd' to Diabetes.

The plan is to:

1. Group all respondents by their hospital.
2. For each hospital, count how many have Cancer (Medical Condition 'c') and how many have Diabetes (Medical Condition 'd').
3. For hospitals where Cancer count > Diabetes count, count all respondents in those hospitals.

First, I need to go through each respondent and note their hospital and medical condition. Let's list out all the respondents:

Respondent 11: Hospital HOSP_11, Medical Condition 'e' (Hypertension)
Respondent 64: HOSP_64, Medical Condition 'd' (Diabetes)
Respondent 113: HOSP_113, Medical Condition 'e' (Hypertension)
Respondent 135: HOSP_135, Medical Condition 'b' (Asthma)
Respondent 134: HOSP_134, Medical Condition 'f' (Obesity)
Respondent 41: HOSP_41, Medical Condition 'f' (Obesity)
Respondent 94: HOSP_94, Medical Condition 'c' (Cancer)

Now, let's group by hospital:

HOSP_11: 1 patient (Hypertension)
HOSP_64: 1 patient (Diabetes)
HOSP_113: 1 patient (Hypertension)
HOSP_135: 1 patient (Asthma)
HOSP_134: 1 patient (Obesity)
HOSP_41: 1 patient (Obesity)
HOSP_94: 1 patient (Cancer)

Wait, but looking at each hospital's patients:

Wait, each hospital in the data seems to have only one respondent. For example, HOSP_94 has respondent 94 with Cancer. HOSP_64 has respondent 64 with Diabetes. HOSP_41 has respondent 41 with Obesity. HOSP_134 has respondent 134 with Obesity. HOSP_113 has respondent 113 with Hypertension. HOSP_135 has respondent 135 with Asthma. HOSP_11 has respondent 11 with Hypertension.

So, in this dataset, each hospital is represented by only one patient. Therefore, for each hospital, the count of Cancer and Diabetes patients would be either 0 or 1.

Now, check each hospital:

HOSP_94: 1 Cancer patient (respondent 94), 0 Diabetes. So Cancer (1) > Diabetes (0) → yes. So all patients in HOSP_94 (which is 1) should be counted.

HOSP_64: 0 Cancer, 1 Diabetes → no.

Other hospitals: HOSP_11, 113, 135, 134, 41: none have Cancer or Diabetes. So their Cancer and Diabetes counts are 0. So 0 > 0 is false.

Therefore, only HOSP_94 meets the condition where Cancer count (1) > Diabetes count (0). The number of respondents in HOSP_94 is 1 (respondent 94).

So the answer should be 1.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
How many respondents over the age of 60 have a length of stay that is longer than the average for their specific Admission Type?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking for the number of respondents over 60 years old who have a length of stay longer than the average for their specific Admission Type. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The dataset has a 'questions' section that defines each field. The 'responses' section contains individual respondents with their answers. 

The key points here are:
1. Identify respondents over 60 (Age > 60).
2. Calculate the length of stay for each respondent (Discharge Date minus Date of Admission).
3. Determine the average length of stay for each Admission Type (Elective, Emergency, Urgent).
4. Compare each eligible respondent's length of stay to the average of their Admission Type.
5. Count how many of those over 60 have a stay longer than their Admission Type's average.

Let's start by extracting the necessary data from the responses. Each respondent has an Age, Admission Type, Date of Admission, and Discharge Date. 

First, filter respondents over 60. Looking at the data:

- Respondent 73: Age 21 → exclude.
- Respondent 100: 42 → exclude.
- Respondent 105: 54 → exclude.
- Respondent 87: 55 → exclude.
- Respondent 14: 85 → include.
- Respondent 86: 80 → include.
- Respondent 17: 19 → exclude.
- Respondent 85: 67 → include.
- Respondent 25: 63 → include.
- Respondent 143: 80 → include.

So, respondents over 60 are 14, 86, 85, 25, 143. That's five respondents.

Next, calculate each of their lengths of stay. Let's parse the dates:

For each of these five, compute (Discharge Date - Admission Date) in days.

Starting with respondent 14:
- Admission: 2023-10-03
- Discharge: 2023-09-11
Wait, that's a problem. The discharge date is before the admission date. That can't be right. Maybe a typo? Let me check again.

Looking at respondent 14's data:
<answer question=""Date of Admission"">2023-10-03</answer>
<answer question=""Discharge Date"">2023-09-11</answer>
Hmm, discharge is September 11, admission is October 3. That's impossible. Maybe the dates are swapped, or there's a data entry error. Since this is a data analysis task, perhaps we have to take the dates as given. But a negative length of stay doesn't make sense. Maybe it's a typo, but without further info, we have to proceed with the given data. So the length would be negative, which is invalid. Maybe this respondent should be excluded from the calculation, or perhaps it's a mistake in the data. Since the problem doesn't mention handling such cases, perhaps we have to proceed, but this might affect the average. Alternatively, maybe the dates are in a different format. Wait, the admission date is 2023-10-03 (October 3) and discharge is 2023-09-11 (September 11). That's impossible. So perhaps the discharge date is actually 2023-11-09 (November 9)? Or maybe the admission was 2023-09-03? But the data is as given. This is a problem. For the sake of proceeding, perhaps we'll have to note that this respondent's length is negative and thus exclude them, but the problem might not account for that. Alternatively, maybe the dates are in a different format, like day-month instead of month-day. Let's check: if the admission is 03 October 2023 and discharge 11 September 2023, that's still impossible. So perhaps this is an error. But since the data is given, maybe we have to proceed, but this would result in a negative value. Let's note this and proceed, but this might affect the average. Alternatively, maybe the discharge date is a typo and should be 2023-11-11. But without knowing, we can't assume. So perhaps this respondent's length is negative, which would be 0 or invalid. Let's proceed with the calculation as per the data, but this might be an outlier.

Next, respondent 86:
Admission: 2021-12-19
Discharge: 2021-10-14
Again, discharge is before admission. Same issue. So length is negative. Hmm. Another problem. This is the same issue. So two respondents (14 and 86) have discharge dates before admission. This is a data quality issue, but perhaps we have to proceed. Let's note that their lengths are negative, which would mean they are not longer than any positive average. But this is a problem. Alternatively, maybe the dates are in a different format, like day-month-year. Let's check:

For respondent 14: Admission 03-10-2023 (3rd October) and discharge 11-09-2023 (11th September). Still, discharge is before admission. So negative. Similarly, respondent 86: Admission 19-12-2021, discharge 14-10-2021. Again, discharge is before. So their lengths are negative. So when calculating the average for their Admission Type, these negative values would lower the average. But since the question is about respondents over 60, and their length of stay being longer than the average, if their length is negative and the average is also negative, then a negative length could be longer than a more negative average. But this is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the dates are in MM-DD-YYYY format. Let's check:

If the dates are in MM-DD-YYYY, then for respondent 14, admission is 10-03-2023 (October 3) and discharge 09-11-2023 (September 11). Still discharge before admission. No. Alternatively, maybe the dates are in YYYY-DD-MM? Unlikely. So perhaps the data has errors. But since the problem doesn't mention this, perhaps we have to proceed as if the dates are correct. So for these two respondents, their length of stay is negative. Let's proceed.

Now, let's process each of the five respondents:

1. Respondent 14:
   - Age: 85
   - Admission Type: a (Elective)
   - Admission Date: 2023-10-03
   - Discharge Date: 2023-09-11
   Length of stay: (2023-09-11) - (2023-10-03) = -22 days.

2. Respondent 86:
   - Age: 80
   - Admission Type: a (Elective)
   - Admission Date: 2021-12-19
   - Discharge Date: 2021-10-14
   Length: (2021-10-14) - (2021-12-19) = -66 days.

3. Respondent 85:
   - Age: 67
   - Admission Type: b (Emergency)
   - Admission Date: 2022-10-29
   - Discharge Date: 2022-11-20
   Length: 2022-11-20 - 2022-10-29 = 22 days (October has 31 days, so 29 to 31 is 2 days, plus 20 in November: 22 days).

4. Respondent 25:
   - Age: 63
   - Admission Type: a (Elective)
   - Admission Date: 2023-11-05
   - Discharge Date: 2023-11-07
   Length: 2 days.

5. Respondent 143:
   - Age: 80
   - Admission Type: b (Emergency)
   - Admission Date: 2022-12-10
   - Discharge Date: 2022-09-27
   Again, discharge before admission. So length is (2022-09-27) - (2022-12-10) = -74 days.

So the five over-60 respondents have lengths: -22, -66, 22, 2, -74.

Now, we need to calculate the average length of stay for each Admission Type. Let's first process all respondents to get the average for each type.

First, list all respondents and their Admission Type and length of stay.

Let's go through each respondent:

1. Respondent 73:
   - Admission Type: a (Elective)
   - Admission: 2024-01-05
   - Discharge: 2024-03-26
   Length: 2024-03-26 - 2024-01-05. January has 31 days, so 26 (Jan) + 28 (Feb) + 26 (March) → Wait, no. Let's calculate days between two dates.

Using date difference calculator:

From 2024-01-05 to 2024-03-26:

January: 31 - 5 = 26 days remaining in Jan.
February: 29 days (2024 is a leap year)
March: 26 days
Total: 26 + 29 + 26 = 81 days.

2. Respondent 100:
   - Admission Type: c (Urgent)
   - Admission: 2023-08-13
   - Discharge: 2023-08-25
   Length: 12 days (25 -13 =12).

3. Respondent 105:
   - Admission Type: a (Elective)
   - Admission: 2023-05-18
   - Discharge: 2023-06-03
   May has 31 days: 31 -18 =13 days in May, plus 3 in June: 16 days.

4. Respondent 87:
   - Admission Type: a (Elective)
   - Admission: 2023-04-09
   - Discharge: 2023-01-27 → Again, discharge before admission. So negative. Let's compute:

2023-01-27 to 2023-04-09: That's positive. Wait, the admission is April 9, discharge January 27? So discharge is before admission. So length is negative. Let's calculate:

From 2023-04-09 to 2023-01-27: that's -73 days.

5. Respondent 14:
   - Admission Type: a (Elective)
   - Length: -22 days (as before).

6. Respondent 86:
   - Admission Type: a (Elective)
   - Length: -66 days.

7. Respondent 17:
   - Admission Type: a (Elective)
   - Admission: 2021-07-03
   - Discharge: 2021-08-12
   Length: August 12 - July 3 = 40 days (July has 31 days: 31-3=28, plus 12 in Aug: 28+12=40).

8. Respondent 85:
   - Admission Type: b (Emergency)
   - Length: 22 days.

9. Respondent 25:
   - Admission Type: a (Elective)
   - Length: 2 days.

10. Respondent 143:
    - Admission Type: b (Emergency)
    - Length: -74 days.

Now, group by Admission Type:

Admission Type a (Elective):
- Respondent 73: 81 days
- Respondent 105: 16 days
- Respondent 87: -73 days
- Respondent 14: -22 days
- Respondent 86: -66 days
- Respondent 17: 40 days
- Respondent 25: 2 days

Total for Elective: 81 +16 + (-73) + (-22) + (-66) +40 +2 = Let's compute step by step:

81 +16 = 97
97 -73 =24
24 -22 =2
2 -66 = -64
-64 +40 = -24
-24 +2 = -22

Number of Elective respondents: 7. Sum is -22. Average: -22 /7 ≈ -3.14 days.

Admission Type b (Emergency):
- Respondent 85: 22 days
- Respondent 143: -74 days

Sum: 22 -74 = -52. Average: -52 /2 = -26 days.

Admission Type c (Urgent):
- Respondent 100: 12 days

Average: 12 days.

Now, for each over-60 respondent, check if their length is greater than their Admission Type's average.

Let's go through the five over-60 respondents:

1. Respondent 14: Elective, length -22. Average for Elective is -3.14. Is -22 > -3.14? No, because -22 is less than -3.14.

2. Respondent 86: Elective, length -66. Average -3.14. -66 < -3.14 → No.

3. Respondent 85: Emergency, length 22. Average for Emergency is -26. 22 > -26 → Yes.

4. Respondent 25: Elective, length 2. Average -3.14. 2 > -3.14 → Yes.

5. Respondent 143: Emergency, length -74. Average -26. -74 > -26? No, because -74 is less than -26.

So, respondents 85 and 25 have lengths longer than their Admission Type's average.

Wait, but respondent 25's length is 2 days, which is higher than the Elective average of -3.14. So yes. Respondent 85's 22 is higher than Emergency's -26. So that's two respondents.

But wait, let's confirm:

For Elective average: -3.14. Respondent 25's length is 2, which is higher than -3.14. So yes.

Respondent 85's length 22 is higher than -26. Yes.

So total of 2 respondents.

But wait, let's check the other over-60 respondents:

Respondent 14: Elective, -22. Average -3.14. -22 is less than -3.14 → No.

Respondent 86: Elective, -66 < -3.14 → No.

Respondent 143: Emergency, -74 < -26 → No.

So only respondents 85 and 25 meet the criteria. That's two people.

But wait, let's check the data again for respondent 25:

Admission Date: 2023-11-05, Discharge: 2023-11-07. So 2 days. Admission Type a (Elective). The average for Elective is -3.14. 2 is indeed greater than -3.14. So yes.

Respondent 85: 22 days, Emergency average -26. 22 > -26 → yes.

So total count is 2.

But wait, the example given in the problem had an answer of 1. But that was for a different question. So in this case, the answer would be 2.

But let's double-check all calculations to ensure no mistakes.

First, calculating the average for each Admission Type:

Elective:

Respondents with Admission Type a (Elective):

73: 81
105:16
87:-73
14:-22
86:-66
17:40
25:2

Sum: 81+16=97; 97-73=24; 24-22=2; 2-66=-64; -64+40=-24; -24+2=-22. Average: -22/7 ≈ -3.14.

Emergency:

85:22
143:-74

Sum: 22-74=-52. Average: -52/2=-26.

Urgent:

100:12. Average:12.

Now, over-60 respondents:

14: Elective, -22. Average -3.14. -22 < -3.14 → No.

86: Elective, -66 < -3.14 → No.

85: Emergency, 22 > -26 → Yes.

25: Elective, 2 > -3.14 → Yes.

143: Emergency, -74 < -26 → No.

So two respondents: 85 and 25.

But wait, respondent 25 is 63 years old, which is over 60. Correct.

So the answer should be 2.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the respondents who are in a hospital where the number of patients with Cancer is greater than the number of patients with Asthma.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents who are in a hospital where the number of patients with Cancer is greater than the number of patients with Asthma. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The data has a list of respondents, each with various answers, including their hospital and medical condition. The hospitals are identified by codes like HOSP_73, HOSP_65, etc. The medical conditions are given as MCQ options, where each answer is a letter code. For example, 'c' corresponds to Cancer and 'b' to Asthma based on the Medical Condition question's options: A. Arthritis B. Asthma C. Cancer D. Diabetes E. Hypertension F. Obesity.

So, the plan is:

1. For each hospital, count how many patients have Cancer (Medical Condition 'c') and how many have Asthma (Medical Condition 'b').
2. Identify hospitals where the Cancer count is greater than the Asthma count.
3. Count the number of respondents in those hospitals.

Let's start by going through each respondent and grouping them by their hospital. Then, for each hospital, tally the Cancer and Asthma cases.

Looking at the respondents:

- Respondent 73: Hospital HOSP_73, Medical Condition 'd' (Diabetes) → Not relevant.
- Respondent 65: HOSP_65, Medical Condition 'e' (Hypertension) → Not relevant.
- Respondent 39: HOSP_39, Medical Condition 'd' (Diabetes) → Not relevant.
- Respondent 86: HOSP_86, Medical Condition 'e' (Hypertension) → Not relevant.
- Respondent 21: HOSP_21, Medical Condition 'a' (Arthritis) → Not relevant.
- Respondent 150: HOSP_150, Medical Condition 'b' (Asthma) → Asthma count +1 for HOSP_150.
- Respondent 37: HOSP_37, Medical Condition 'd' (Diabetes) → Not relevant.
- Respondent 90: HOSP_90, Medical Condition 'b' (Asthma) → Asthma +1 for HOSP_90.
- Respondent 80: HOSP_80, Medical Condition 'c' (Cancer) → Cancer +1 for HOSP_80.
- Respondent 101: HOSP_101, Medical Condition 'e' (Hypertension) → Not relevant.
- Respondent 34: HOSP_34, Medical Condition 'e' (Hypertension) → Not relevant.

Wait, let me check each respondent again carefully:

Looking at each respondent's Medical Condition:

- Respondent 73: Medical Condition 'd' → Diabetes.
- Respondent 65: 'e' → Hypertension.
- Respondent 39: 'd' → Diabetes.
- Respondent 86: 'e' → Hypertension.
- Respondent 21: 'a' → Arthritis.
- Respondent 150: 'b' → Asthma.
- Respondent 37: 'd' → Diabetes.
- Respondent 90: 'b' → Asthma.
- Respondent 80: 'c' → Cancer.
- Respondent 101: 'e' → Hypertension.
- Respondent 34: 'e' → Hypertension.

So, the only hospitals with relevant conditions are:

- HOSP_150: 1 Asthma.
- HOSP_90: 1 Asthma.
- HOSP_80: 1 Cancer.

Other hospitals (HOSP_73, 65, 39, 86, 21, 37, 101, 34) have no Cancer or Asthma cases.

Now, for each hospital:

- HOSP_80: Cancer =1, Asthma=0 → Cancer > Asthma. So all respondents in HOSP_80 should be counted. Respondent 80 is in HOSP_80.

HOSP_150: Cancer=0, Asthma=1 → Not counted.

HOSP_90: Cancer=0, Asthma=1 → Not counted.

Other hospitals have no Cancer or Asthma, so their counts are 0 for both, which doesn't meet the condition.

Therefore, only HOSP_80 has more Cancer than Asthma patients. The number of respondents in HOSP_80 is 1 (respondent 80).

So the final answer is 1.
