<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents have Gender = 'Female' and Insurance Provider = 'Cigna'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question. The task is to find out how many respondents have Gender as 'Female' and Insurance Provider as 'Cigna'. 

First, I need to refer to the questions section to understand the MCQ options. For Gender, the options are A. Female and B. Male. So, in the responses, if a respondent's Gender is 'a', that's Female, and 'b' is Male. 

For Insurance Provider, the options are A. Aetna, B. Blue Cross, C. Cigna, D. Medicare, E. UnitedHealthcare. So, if a respondent has 'c' here, that maps to Cigna.

Now, I need to go through each respondent in the responses and check these two conditions. Let's look at each one:

Respondent 18: Gender is 'b' (Male), Insurance Provider is 'b' (Blue Cross). Doesn't meet either condition.

Respondent 61: Gender is 'b' (Male), Insurance Provider is 'c' (Cigna). So, Insurance Provider is correct, but Gender is Male. Doesn't meet both.

Respondent 74: Gender 'b' (Male), Insurance Provider 'e' (UnitedHealthcare). Nope.

Respondent 59: Gender 'a' (Female), Insurance Provider 'e' (UnitedHealthcare). Gender is correct, but Insurance Provider isn't Cigna.

Respondent 24: Gender 'a' (Female), Insurance Provider 'b' (Blue Cross). Again, Gender is Female, but Insurance Provider is Blue Cross, not Cigna.

Looking at all five respondents, none of them have both Gender as Female and Insurance Provider as Cigna. Wait, but let me double-check. Respondent 59 is Female (a) but Insurance Provider is e (UnitedHealthcare). Respondent 24 is Female (a) but Insurance Provider is b (Blue Cross). The only one with Insurance Provider 'c' is Respondent 61, but their Gender is Male. So, no one meets both conditions. Therefore, the count should be 0.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose Billing Amount is greater than 10000.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task. The question is asking to count the number of respondents whose Billing Amount is greater than 10,000. 

First, I need to go through each respondent's data and check their Billing Amount. The Billing Amount is an open-ended field, so the values are numerical. I should look at each one and see if it's more than 10,000.

Starting with Respondent 26: Billing Amount is 23737. That's definitely over 10,000. So count 1.

Respondent 114: 20258. Also over 10k. Count becomes 2.

Respondent 43: 10710. Just over 10k. Count 3.

Respondent 77: 39958. Yes, count 4.

Respondent 8: 3909. That's under 10k. No change.

Respondent 12: 45820. Over, count 5.

Respondent 84: 17993. Over, count 6.

Respondent 15: 3879. Under. Still 6.

Respondent 76: 17440. Over, count 7.

Respondent 92: 18835. Over, count 8.

Respondent 96: 49834. Over, count 9.

Wait, let me double-check each one to make sure I didn't miss any. Let's list them all again:

26: 23737 – yes
114: 20258 – yes
43: 10710 – yes
77: 39958 – yes
8: 3909 – no
12: 45820 – yes
84: 17993 – yes
15: 3879 – no
76: 17440 – yes
92: 18835 – yes
96: 49834 – yes

So that's 9 respondents. Wait, but when I counted step by step, I ended up with 9. Let me count again:

1. 26: yes
2. 114: yes (2)
3. 43: yes (3)
4. 77: yes (4)
5. 12: yes (5)
6. 84: yes (6)
7. 76: yes (7)
8. 92: yes (8)
9. 96: yes (9)

Yes, that's 9. So the answer should be 9.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents have a Medication of 'Penicillin'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question. The task is to find out how many respondents have a Medication of 'Penicillin'. 

First, I need to check the schema for the Medication question. Looking at the Questions section, question 13 is about Medication, which is an MCQ with options: A. Aspirin, B. Ibuprofen, C. Lipitor, D. Paracetamol, E. Penicillin. So, the code 'e' corresponds to Penicillin.

Now, I'll go through each respondent's data and check their Medication entry. Let's list them out:

- Respondent 38: Medication is 'd' → Paracetamol. Not Penicillin.
- Respondent 63: Medication 'b' → Ibuprofen. No.
- Respondent 136: Medication 'b' → Ibuprofen. No.
- Respondent 106: Medication 'c' → Lipitor. No.
- Respondent 145: Medication 'e' → Penicillin. That's one.
- Respondent 47: Medication 'b' → Ibuprofen. No.
- Respondent 44: Medication 'e' → Penicillin. That's two.
- Respondent 45: Medication 'a' → Aspirin. No.
- Respondent 21: Medication 'e' → Penicillin. That's three.
- Respondent 98: Medication 'b' → Ibuprofen. No.
- Respondent 62: Medication 'b' → Ibuprofen. No.

Wait, let me double-check each one to be sure. 

Respondent 145: 'e' → Penicillin. Correct. 
Respondent 44: 'e' → Penicillin. Correct.
Respondent 21: 'e' → Penicillin. Correct.

So that's three respondents. Wait, but in the example given earlier, the answer was 1. But in this case, the answer is 3? Let me check again to make sure I didn't miss any.

Wait, let me recount:

Looking at each respondent:

38: d → no
63: b → no
136: b → no
106: c → no
145: e → yes (1)
47: b → no
44: e → yes (2)
45: a → no
21: e → yes (3)
98: b → no
62: b → no

Yes, three respondents (145, 44, 21) have Medication 'e', which is Penicillin. So the answer should be 3.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
How many respondents have a Test Results of 'Abnormal'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question. The task is to find out how many respondents have a Test Results of 'Abnormal'. 

First, I need to check the schema for the Test Results question. Looking at the Questions section, question 14 is Test Results with options: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal. So, the code 'a' corresponds to Abnormal.

Now, I'll go through each respondent's Test Results entry and count how many have 'a'. Let's list them out:

Respondent 150: Test Results is 'c' → Normal. Not counted.
Respondent 37: 'a' → Abnormal. Count 1.
Respondent 60: 'c' → Normal. No.
Respondent 119: 'a' → Abnormal. Count 2.
Respondent 66: 'b' → Inconclusive. No.
Respondent 118: 'c' → Normal. No.
Respondent 3: 'b' → Inconclusive. No.
Respondent 120: 'b' → Inconclusive. No.
Respondent 74: 'a' → Abnormal. Count 3.
Respondent 140: 'a' → Abnormal. Count 4.
Respondent 41: 'a' → Abnormal. Count 5.
Respondent 19: 'c' → Normal. No.

Wait, let me double-check each one to make sure I didn't miss any. 

Looking again:

- Respondent 37: a → Abnormal (1)
- Respondent 119: a → Abnormal (2)
- Respondent 74: a → Abnormal (3)
- Respondent 140: a → Abnormal (4)
- Respondent 41: a → Abnormal (5)

So that's five respondents with Test Results 'Abnormal'. Hmm, but wait, let me check again. 

Wait, Respondent 3's Test Results is 'b' (Inconclusive), Respondent 120 is 'b' (Inconclusive), Respondent 66 is 'b' (Inconclusive). The others with 'a' are 37, 119, 74, 140, 41. That's five. 

Yes, that's correct. So the answer should be 5.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the respondents whose Billing Amount is greater than 40000.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem. The task is to count the respondents whose Billing Amount is greater than 40,000. 

First, I need to look at the data provided for each respondent and check their Billing Amount. The Billing Amount is an open-ended question, so the values are numerical. 

Let me go through each respondent one by one:

- **Respondent 89**: Billing Amount is 32629. That's less than 40k.
- **Respondent 77**: 39958. Just under 40k, so no.
- **Respondent 109**: 35522. Still below.
- **Respondent 65**: 29851. Nope.
- **Respondent 117**: 20228. No.
- **Respondent 78**: 23068. Not enough.
- **Respondent 51**: 14300. Way lower.
- **Respondent 99**: 2305. Definitely not.
- **Respondent 124**: 46814. This is over 40k. So count this one.
- **Respondent 28**: 5767. No.
- **Respondent 61**: 23500. Below.
- **Respondent 98**: 24637. Also below.

So only Respondent 124 has a Billing Amount over 40,000. Let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss any. Scanning through again, yes, only 46814 in Respondent 124 meets the criteria. Therefore, the count is 1.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents have a Test Results of 'Inconclusive'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question. The task is to find out how many respondents have a Test Results of 'Inconclusive'. 

First, I need to check the schema for the Test Results question. Looking at the questions section, question 14 is Test Results with options A. Abnormal, B. Inconclusive, C. Normal. So the code 'B' corresponds to Inconclusive.

Now, I'll go through each respondent's Test Results entry and count how many have 'B'. Let's list them out:

Respondent 148: Test Results is 'a' → Abnormal. Not counted.
Respondent 76: Test Results is 'b' → Inconclusive. Count 1.
Respondent 6: Test Results is 'b' → Inconclusive. Count 2.
Respondent 102: Test Results is 'a' → Abnormal. Not counted.
Respondent 71: Test Results is 'c' → Normal. Not counted.
Respondent 3: Test Results is 'b' → Inconclusive. Count 3.
Respondent 145: Test Results is 'a' → Abnormal. Not counted.
Respondent 13: Test Results is 'b' → Inconclusive. Count 4.
Respondent 128: Test Results is 'b' → Inconclusive. Count 5.
Respondent 74: Test Results is 'a' → Abnormal. Not counted.

Wait, let me double-check each one to make sure I didn't miss any. 

Looking again:

- Respondent 76: B → Inconclusive (1)
- Respondent 6: B → Inconclusive (2)
- Respondent 3: B → Inconclusive (3)
- Respondent 13: B → Inconclusive (4)
- Respondent 128: B → Inconclusive (5)

So that's a total of 5 respondents with Test Results 'Inconclusive'. Hmm, but wait, the example given in the problem had an answer of 1, but that was for a different question. For this task, the answer should be 5. Let me confirm once more.

Yes, each of those five respondents have 'b' in Test Results, which maps to Inconclusive. The others are 'a' or 'c', which are Abnormal or Normal. So the count is 5.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents have a Test Results of 'Inconclusive'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question. The task is to find out how many respondents have a Test Results of 'Inconclusive'. 

First, I need to check the schema for the Test Results question. Looking at the Questions section, question 14 is Test Results with options A. Abnormal, B. Inconclusive, C. Normal. So the code 'b' corresponds to Inconclusive.

Now, I'll go through each respondent's Test Results entry and count how many have 'b' (case-insensitive, but all examples here use lowercase). 

Starting with Respondent 91: Test Results is 'c' → Normal. Not counted.

Respondent 57: Test Results 'b' → Inconclusive. That's one.

Respondent 49: 'c' → Normal. No.

Respondent 65: 'c' → Normal. No.

Respondent 36: 'c' → Normal. No.

Respondent 25: 'a' → Abnormal. No.

Respondent 11: 'b' → Inconclusive. That's two.

Respondent 80: 'c' → Normal. No.

So total of 2 respondents with Inconclusive test results.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents have a Medication of 'Aspirin'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question. The task is to find out how many respondents have a Medication of 'Aspirin'. 

First, I need to check the schema for the Medication question. Looking at the Questions section, question 13 is Medication, which is an MCQ with options: A. Aspirin B. Ibuprofen C. Lipitor D. Paracetamol E. Penicillin. So, the code 'a' corresponds to Aspirin.

Now, I'll go through each respondent's Medication entry in the Responses section to count how many have 'a' (which maps to Aspirin). Let's list them out:

Respondent 9: Medication is 'c' → Lipitor. Not Aspirin.
Respondent 149: 'b' → Ibuprofen. No.
Respondent 94: 'e' → Penicillin. No.
Respondent 34: 'd' → Paracetamol. No.
Respondent 24: 'c' → Lipitor. No.
Respondent 76: 'd' → Paracetamol. No.
Respondent 84: 'b' → Ibuprofen. No.
Respondent 107: 'a' → Aspirin. Yes. Count 1.
Respondent 45: 'a' → Aspirin. Yes. Count 2.
Respondent 52: 'd' → Paracetamol. No.
Respondent 139: 'a' → Aspirin. Yes. Count 3.
Respondent 136: 'b' → Ibuprofen. No.

Wait, let me double-check each one to avoid mistakes. 

Respondent 107: Medication is 'a' → Aspirin. Correct. 
Respondent 45: 'a' → Aspirin. Correct.
Respondent 139: 'a' → Aspirin. Correct. 

So that's three respondents. But wait, the example given in the initial data had an answer of 1 for a similar question. Wait, no, the example was a different question (Gender Male and Hypertension). But here, the answer should be 3. Let me check again.

Wait, looking back:

Respondent 107: Medication: a → Aspirin. Yes.
Respondent 45: Medication: a → Aspirin. Yes.
Respondent 139: Medication: a → Aspirin. Yes.

Yes, three respondents. So the answer should be 3.

<task>
How many respondents have Gender = 'Male' and Insurance Provider = 'Medicare'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking how many respondents have both Gender as 'Male' and Insurance Provider as 'Medicare'. 

First, I need to refer back to the questions section to understand the mapping of the MCQ options. 

Looking at the Gender question: it's MCQ with options A. Female and B. Male. So, in the responses, if a respondent's Gender is 'a', that's Female, and 'b' is Male.

Next, the Insurance Provider question: options are A. Aetna, B. Blue Cross, C. Cigna, D. Medicare, E. UnitedHealthcare. So, the code 'd' corresponds to Medicare.

Now, I need to go through each respondent in the responses and check two things: their Gender code and Insurance Provider code. If both are 'b' (for Male) and 'd' (for Medicare), then they should be counted.

Let's go through each respondent one by one:

Respondent 43:
- Gender: a → Female
- Insurance Provider: b → Blue Cross
Not matching both criteria.

Respondent 66:
- Gender: b → Male
- Insurance Provider: e → UnitedHealthcare
Only Gender matches, Insurance doesn't.

Respondent 124:
- Gender: b → Male
- Insurance Provider: c → Cigna
Only Gender matches.

Respondent 76:
- Gender: a → Female
- Insurance Provider: e → UnitedHealthcare
Neither matches.

Respondent 87:
- Gender: a → Female
- Insurance Provider: a → Aetna
No match.

Respondent 30:
- Gender: a → Female
- Insurance Provider: d → Medicare
Insurance matches, but Gender is Female. So no.

Respondent 120:
- Gender: b → Male
- Insurance Provider: a → Aetna
Only Gender matches.

Respondent 20:
- Gender: a → Female
- Insurance Provider: d → Medicare
Again, Insurance matches, but Gender is Female.

Respondent 37:
- Gender: a → Female
- Insurance Provider: e → UnitedHealthcare
No match.

So after checking all respondents, none of them have both Gender as Male (code 'b') and Insurance Provider as Medicare (code 'd'). The only respondents with Insurance Provider 'd' (Medicare) are Respondent 30 and 20, but both have Gender 'a' (Female). Therefore, the count is 0.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose Age is greater than 60.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem. The task is to count the number of respondents whose age is greater than 60. Let me start by reviewing the data provided.

First, I need to look at each respondent's age. The age is an open-ended question, so the values are numerical. I'll go through each respondent one by one.

Starting with Respondent 102: Age is 59. That's less than 60, so not counted.

Respondent 143: Age 80. That's over 60. Count this one.

Respondent 94: Age 81. Also over 60. Add to the count.

Respondent 24: 31 years old. Under 60. No.

Respondent 4: 51. Still under 60.

Respondent 68: 26. Nope.

Respondent 138: 58. Under 60.

Respondent 32: 28. Not over 60.

So, looking through all the respondents, only Respondent 143 (80) and Respondent 94 (81) are over 60. That makes a total of 2.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents have a Medical Condition of 'Asthma'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question. The task is to find out how many respondents have a Medical Condition of 'Asthma'. 

First, I need to refer to the questions section to understand the Medical Condition options. The Medical Condition question is MCQ with options: A. Arthritis, B. Asthma, C. Cancer, D. Diabetes, E. Hypertension, F. Obesity. So, 'Asthma' corresponds to option B.

Now, I'll go through each respondent's data and check their Medical Condition entry. For each respondent, if the Medical Condition is 'b' (case-insensitive), then they have Asthma. 

Looking at the responses:

- Respondent 95: Medical Condition is 'e' → Hypertension. Not Asthma.
- Respondent 68: 'c' → Cancer. No.
- Respondent 150: 'b' → Asthma. Count 1.
- Respondent 98: 'b' → Asthma. Count 2.
- Respondent 96: 'b' → Asthma. Count 3.
- Respondent 28: 'd' → Diabetes. No.
- Respondent 60: 'b' → Asthma. Count 4.
- Respondent 121: 'e' → Hypertension. No.
- Respondent 7: 'd' → Diabetes. No.
- Respondent 144: 'c' → Cancer. No.
- Respondent 84: 'f' → Obesity. No.
- Respondent 57: 'd' → Diabetes. No.

Wait, let me double-check each one to be sure. 

Respondent 150: B. Asthma. Yes. 
Respondent 98: B. Asthma. Yes. 
Respondent 96: B. Asthma. Yes. 
Respondent 60: B. Asthma. Yes. 

That's four respondents. So the answer should be 4.

<task>
How many respondents have Gender = 'Male' and Medical Condition = 'Asthma'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find out how many respondents are Male and have Asthma as their medical condition. 

First, I need to refer to the questions section to understand the MCQ options. For Gender, the options are A. Female and B. Male. So, if a respondent's Gender is 'b', that translates to Male. 

Next, looking at the Medical Condition, the options are A. Arthritis, B. Asthma, C. Cancer, D. Diabetes, E. Hypertension, F. Obesity. So, a Medical Condition of 'b' corresponds to Asthma.

Now, I need to go through each respondent in the responses section and check both their Gender and Medical Condition codes. Let's list them out:

Respondent 119:
- Gender: a → Female
- Medical Condition: f → Obesity
Doesn't meet the criteria.

Respondent 78:
- Gender: b → Male
- Medical Condition: d → Diabetes
Nope, Medical Condition is Diabetes.

Respondent 105:
- Gender: b → Male
- Medical Condition: c → Cancer
Still not Asthma.

Respondent 30:
- Gender: a → Female
- Medical Condition: b → Asthma
Female, so doesn't count.

Respondent 36:
- Gender: b → Male
- Medical Condition: a → Arthritis
Arthritis, not Asthma.

Respondent 12:
- Gender: b → Male
- Medical Condition: d → Diabetes
Again, Diabetes.

Looking through all six respondents, none of the Male respondents (78, 105, 36, 12) have Medical Condition 'b' (Asthma). The only respondent with Asthma is Respondent 30, but they are Female. 

So the count should be zero.

<task>
How many respondents have Gender = 'Female' and Admission Type = 'Urgent'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question. The task is to find out how many respondents are Female and have an Admission Type of Urgent. 

First, I need to look at the schema for both Gender and Admission Type. 

For Gender, the options are A. Female and B. Male. So in the responses, 'a' corresponds to Female and 'b' to Male.

For Admission Type, the options are A. Elective, B. Emergency, C. Urgent. So the code 'c' would mean Urgent.

Now, I need to go through each respondent and check these two conditions. Let's look at each one:

Respondent 78:
- Gender: b → Male. Doesn't meet the Female condition. Skip.

Respondent 127:
- Gender: b → Male. Skip.

Respondent 30:
- Gender: a → Female. Now check Admission Type. Admission Type is 'b' → Emergency. Not Urgent. So no.

Respondent 25:
- Gender: a → Female. Admission Type is 'a' → Elective. Not Urgent. Doesn't match.

Respondent 61:
- Gender: b → Male. Skip.

Wait, that's all the respondents. None of the Female respondents (30 and 25) have Admission Type 'c' (Urgent). So the count is zero. But wait, let me double-check. 

Looking again at each Female respondent:

Respondent 30: Admission Type is 'b' which is Emergency. 

Respondent 25: Admission Type is 'a' which is Elective. 

No one has 'c' for Admission Type. So the answer should be 0.

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
How many respondents have Gender = 'Female' and Insurance Provider = 'Medicare'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find out how many respondents have Gender as 'Female' and Insurance Provider as 'Medicare'. 

First, I need to refer to the questions section to understand the MCQ options. For Gender, the options are A. Female and B. Male. So, if a respondent's Gender is 'a', that maps to Female. For Insurance Provider, the options are A. Aetna, B. Blue Cross, C. Cigna, D. Medicare, E. UnitedHealthcare. So, 'd' in the response would correspond to Medicare.

Now, I'll go through each respondent's data to check these two conditions. Let's look at each one:

Respondent 100: Gender is 'a' (Female), Insurance Provider is 'd' (Medicare). So this one meets both conditions. Count = 1.

Respondent 117: Gender is 'a' (Female), Insurance Provider is 'e' (UnitedHealthcare). Doesn't meet the insurance condition. Count remains 1.

Respondent 95: Gender 'a' (Female), Insurance Provider 'a' (Aetna). Insurance doesn't match. Still 1.

Respondent 139: Gender is blank. So even if Insurance was Medicare, which it's 'b' (Blue Cross), this doesn't count. No change.

Respondent 108: Gender 'a' (Female), Insurance 'e' (UnitedHealthcare). Doesn't match. Count stays 1.

Respondent 40: Gender 'a' (Female), Insurance 'd' (Medicare). Both conditions met. Now count is 2.

Respondent 107: Gender 'a' (Female), Insurance 'a' (Aetna). Doesn't match. Final count remains 2.

Wait, let me double-check. Respondent 40: Gender is 'a' (Female), Insurance Provider 'd' (Medicare). Yes, that's correct. So total of 2 respondents: 100 and 40. Wait, but in the data, Respondent 100's Insurance Provider is 'd' (Medicare) and Gender 'a' (Female). Respondent 40: Gender 'a' (Female), Insurance 'd' (Medicare). So that's two. Did I miss any others?

Wait, let me check again:

Respondent 100: Yes.

Respondent 40: Yes.

Any others? Let's see:

Respondent 95: Insurance is 'a' (Aetna). No.

Respondent 108: Insurance 'e'. No.

Respondent 107: 'a' (Aetna). No.

Others: 117, 139. No. So total is 2. But wait, the example given in the initial data had an answer of 1 for a similar question. But in this case, the answer should be 2. Let me confirm once more.

Yes, Respondent 100 and 40 both have Gender 'a' (Female) and Insurance Provider 'd' (Medicare). So the answer is 2.

<task>
How many respondents have Gender = 'Female' and Admission Type = 'Emergency'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find out how many respondents are Female and had an Emergency admission type. 

First, I need to refer to the questions section to understand the mapping of the MCQ options. For Gender, the options are A. Female and B. Male. So, in the responses, if a respondent has Gender 'a', that's Female. For Admission Type, the options are A. Elective, B. Emergency, C. Urgent. So, 'b' in the Admission Type corresponds to Emergency.

Now, I'll go through each respondent's data to check these two conditions.

Starting with Respondent 126: Gender is 'b' (Male) and Admission Type is 'b' (Emergency). So, Gender is not Female. Doesn't count.

Respondent 105: Gender 'b' (Male), Admission Type 'a' (Elective). Both conditions not met.

Respondent 72: Gender 'a' (Female). Admission Type 'b' (Emergency). Both conditions met. That's one.

Respondent 9: Gender 'a' (Female). Admission Type 'b' (Emergency). Another one. Now two.

Respondent 95: Gender 'a' (Female). Admission Type 'a' (Elective). So, Admission Type doesn't match. Doesn't count.

Respondent 56: Gender 'b' (Male). Admission Type 'c' (Urgent). Doesn't meet either condition.

So, total of two respondents: Respondent 72 and Respondent 9. The answer should be 2.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents have a Medical Condition of 'Cancer'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question. The task is to find out how many respondents have a Medical Condition of 'Cancer'. 

First, I need to refer back to the questions section to understand the Medical Condition options. The Medical Condition question is MCQ with options: A. Arthritis, B. Asthma, C. Cancer, D. Diabetes, E. Hypertension, F. Obesity. So, the code for Cancer is 'C'.

Now, I'll go through each respondent's data and check their Medical Condition value. Let's list them out:

- Respondent 114: Medical Condition is 'd' → Diabetes. Not Cancer.
- Respondent 61: 'b' → Asthma. No.
- Respondent 93: 'a' → Arthritis. No.
- Respondent 26: 'd' → Diabetes. No.
- Respondent 95: 'e' → Hypertension. No.
- Respondent 140: 'c' → Cancer. That's one.
- Respondent 92: 'a' → Arthritis. No.
- Respondent 16: 'e' → Hypertension. No.
- Respondent 102: 'e' → Hypertension. No.
- Respondent 71: 'd' → Diabetes. No.
- Respondent 49: 'a' → Arthritis. No.
- Respondent 32: 'e' → Hypertension. No.

Looking through all respondents, only Respondent 140 has Medical Condition 'c', which maps to Cancer. So the count is 1.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents have Gender = 'Male' and Admission Type = 'Elective'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find out how many respondents have Gender as 'Male' and Admission Type as 'Elective'. 

First, I need to refer back to the questions section to understand the MCQ options. For Gender, the options are A. Female and B. Male. So, a response of 'a' would be Female, and 'b' is Male. For Admission Type, the options are A. Elective, B. Emergency, C. Urgent. So, 'a' in Admission Type corresponds to Elective.

Now, I'll go through each respondent and check their Gender and Admission Type. Let's list them out:

Respondent 24: Gender is 'a' (Female), Admission Type 'b' (Emergency). Doesn't meet both criteria.

Respondent 55: Gender 'b' (Male), Admission Type 'b' (Emergency). Only Gender matches, not Admission Type.

Respondent 6: Gender 'b' (Male), Admission Type 'a' (Elective). Both conditions met. Count 1.

Respondent 13: Gender 'b' (Male), Admission Type 'b' (Emergency). Only Gender matches.

Respondent 86: Gender 'a' (Female), Admission Type 'a' (Elective). Only Admission Type matches.

Respondent 63: Gender 'b' (Male), Admission Type 'a' (Elective). Both conditions met. Count 2.

Respondent 33: Gender 'b' (Male), Admission Type 'b' (Emergency). Only Gender.

Respondent 145: Gender 'b' (Male), Admission Type 'c' (Urgent). Only Gender.

Respondent 53: Gender 'b' (Male), Admission Type 'c' (Urgent). Only Gender.

Respondent 18: Gender 'b' (Male), Admission Type 'b' (Emergency). Only Gender.

Respondent 142: Gender 'a' (Female), Admission Type 'a' (Elective). Only Admission Type.

Respondent 54: Gender 'a' (Female), Admission Type 'c' (Urgent). Neither.

So, the respondents that meet both conditions are Respondent 6 and 63. That's a total of 2.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
How many respondents have Gender = 'Female' and Insurance Provider = 'UnitedHealthcare'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find out how many respondents have Gender as 'Female' and Insurance Provider as 'UnitedHealthcare'. 

First, I need to refer back to the questions section to understand the mapping of the MCQ options. For Gender, the options are A. Female and B. Male. So, in the responses, if a respondent's Gender is 'a', that corresponds to Female, and 'b' is Male. 

Next, the Insurance Provider question has options: A. Aetna, B. Blue Cross, C. Cigna, D. Medicare, E. UnitedHealthcare. So, the code 'e' in the responses would map to UnitedHealthcare.

Now, I need to go through each respondent in the responses and check two things: their Gender code and Insurance Provider code. 

Let's look at each respondent one by one:

- **Respondent 60**: Gender is 'b' (Male), Insurance Provider 'e' (UnitedHealthcare). So, Gender is not Female. Doesn't count.
- **Respondent 85**: Gender 'b' (Male), Insurance Provider 'd' (Medicare). Not matching.
- **Respondent 38**: Gender 'b' (Male), Insurance Provider 'a' (Aetna). Nope.
- **Respondent 1**: Gender 'b' (Male), Insurance Provider 'd' (Medicare). Not a match.
- **Respondent 71**: Gender 'b' (Male), Insurance Provider 'b' (Blue Cross). Doesn't fit.
- **Respondent 34**: Gender 'a' (Female), Insurance Provider 'c' (Cigna). So, Gender is correct, but Insurance Provider is Cigna, not UnitedHealthcare. Doesn't count.
- **Respondent 139**: Gender is blank. Since there's no code provided, we can't assume it's Female. So, exclude.
- **Respondent 65**: Gender 'a' (Female), Insurance Provider 'c' (Cigna). Again, Gender is correct, but Insurance Provider is Cigna. Not a match.

Looking through all respondents, none of them have both Gender 'a' (Female) and Insurance Provider 'e' (UnitedHealthcare). The only Female respondents are 34 and 65, but their Insurance Providers are Cigna and Cigna, respectively. Respondent 34's Insurance Provider is 'c' (Cigna), and Respondent 65's is also 'c' (Cigna). 

Therefore, the count is zero.

How many respondents have Gender = 'Female' and Medical Condition = 'Asthma'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking how many respondents have Gender as 'Female' and Medical Condition as 'Asthma'. 

First, I need to refer to the questions section to understand the mapping of the MCQ options. For Gender, the options are A. Female and B. Male. So, in the responses, if a respondent's Gender is 'a', that corresponds to Female, and 'b' is Male. 

For Medical Condition, the options are A. Arthritis, B. Asthma, C. Cancer, D. Diabetes, E. Hypertension, F. Obesity. So, a response of 'b' here would mean Asthma.

Now, I need to go through each respondent in the responses section and check two things: their Gender and Medical Condition. 

Let's look at each respondent one by one:

Respondent 29: Gender is 'b' (Male), Medical Condition 'c' (Cancer). Doesn't meet the criteria.

Respondent 7: Gender 'b' (Male), Medical Condition 'd' (Diabetes). No match.

Respondent 34: Gender 'a' (Female), Medical Condition 'e' (Hypertension). So Gender is correct, but Medical Condition is not Asthma.

Respondent 4: Gender 'b' (Male), Medical Condition 'd' (Diabetes). Not a match.

Respondent 92: Gender 'b' (Male), Medical Condition 'a' (Arthritis). No.

Respondent 61: Gender 'b' (Male), Medical Condition 'b' (Asthma). Here, Medical Condition is Asthma, but Gender is Male. So doesn't meet both conditions.

Respondent 83: Gender 'a' (Female), Medical Condition 'a' (Arthritis). Gender is correct, but Medical Condition is Arthritis, not Asthma.

Looking through all respondents, none of them have both Gender as Female (a) and Medical Condition as Asthma (b). So the count should be zero.

<task>
How many respondents have a Blood Type of 'O+'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question. The task is to find out how many respondents have a Blood Type of 'O+'. 

First, I need to refer to the questions section to understand the Blood Type options. The Blood Type question is MCQ with options: A. A+, B. A-, C. AB+, D. AB-, E. B+, F. B-, G. O+, H. O-. So the code 'G' corresponds to O+.

Now, I'll check each respondent's Blood Type in the responses. Let's go through them one by one.

Respondent 45: Blood Type is 'b'. Looking at the options, B is A-. Not O+.

Respondent 68: Blood Type is 'g'. According to the options, G is O+. So this one counts.

Respondent 14: Blood Type 'e' which is B+. Not O+.

Respondent 33: Blood Type 'e' again, B+. Not O+.

Respondent 108: Blood Type 'a' which is A+. Not O+.

So only Respondent 68 has Blood Type O+. That means the count is 1.

<task>
How many respondents have Gender = 'Female' and Medical Condition = 'Diabetes'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking how many respondents have Gender as 'Female' and Medical Condition as 'Diabetes'. 

First, I need to refer back to the data provided. Let's start by understanding the schema for the Gender and Medical Condition fields. 

Looking at the Questions section:
- Gender is a multiple-choice question (MCQ) with options A. Female and B. Male. So, if a respondent's Gender is 'a', that maps to Female, and 'b' maps to Male.
- Medical Condition is also an MCQ with options A. Arthritis, B. Asthma, C. Cancer, D. Diabetes, E. Hypertension, F. Obesity. So, a response of 'd' would correspond to Diabetes.

Now, I need to go through each respondent in the Responses section and check two things: whether their Gender is 'a' (Female) and their Medical Condition is 'd' (Diabetes).

Let's check each respondent one by one:

1. **Respondent 17**:
   - Gender: a → Female
   - Medical Condition: c → Cancer
   - So, not matching both criteria.

2. **Respondent 122**:
   - Gender: a → Female
   - Medical Condition: d → Diabetes
   - Both criteria met. Count = 1.

3. **Respondent 115**:
   - Gender: b → Male
   - Medical Condition: e → Hypertension
   - Doesn't meet either criteria.

4. **Respondent 93**:
   - Gender: a → Female
   - Medical Condition: a → Arthritis
   - Only Gender matches, not Medical Condition.

5. **Respondent 132**:
   - Gender: a → Female
   - Medical Condition: f → Obesity
   - Only Gender matches.

6. **Respondent 28**:
   - Gender: b → Male
   - Medical Condition: d → Diabetes
   - Only Medical Condition matches.

So, out of all respondents, only Respondent 122 meets both conditions: Female and Diabetes. Therefore, the count is 1.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents have a Blood Type of 'A+'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question. The task is to find out how many respondents have a Blood Type of 'A+'. 

First, I need to check the schema for the Blood Type question. The options are listed as [MCQ: A. A+ B. A- C. AB+ D. AB- E. B+ F. B- G. O+ H. O-]. So, each letter corresponds to a specific blood type. The code 'a' would be A+, 'b' is A-, and so on.

Now, I'll go through each respondent's data and look at their Blood Type entry. For each respondent, I need to map their response code to the actual blood type using the schema. Then, count how many have 'A+'.

Starting with Respondent 129: Blood Type is 'e'. According to the schema, E is B+. So that's not A+.

Respondent 57: Blood Type 'h' which is O-. Not A+.

Respondent 12: Blood Type 'c' which is AB+. Nope.

Respondent 134: Blood Type 'd' is AB-. Not A+.

Respondent 78: Blood Type 'e' is B+.

Respondent 118: Blood Type 'd' is AB-.

Respondent 8: Blood Type 'e' is B+.

Respondent 16: Blood Type 'a' which is A+. Oh, here's one. So count 1.

Respondent 123: Blood Type 'd' is AB-.

Respondent 103: Blood Type 'c' is AB+.

Respondent 110: Blood Type 'e' is B+.

Respondent 28: Blood Type 'c' is AB+.

So, only Respondent 16 has Blood Type 'A+'. The answer should be 1.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents have Gender = 'Male' and Insurance Provider = 'Aetna'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question. The task is to find out how many respondents have Gender as 'Male' and Insurance Provider as 'Aetna'. 

First, I need to refer to the questions section to understand the mapping of the MCQ options. 

Looking at the Gender question: it's MCQ with options A. Female and B. Male. So, if a respondent's Gender is 'a', that's Female, and 'b' is Male.

For Insurance Provider, the options are A. Aetna, B. Blue Cross, C. Cigna, D. Medicare, E. UnitedHealthcare. So, if a respondent's Insurance Provider is 'a', that maps to Aetna.

Now, I need to go through each respondent in the responses and check two things: their Gender code and Insurance Provider code. 

Let's go through each respondent one by one:

Respondent 114: Gender is 'a' (Female), Insurance Provider 'b' (Blue Cross). Doesn't meet both conditions.

Respondent 19: Gender 'a' (Female), Insurance Provider 'c' (Cigna). No.

Respondent 21: Gender 'b' (Male), Insurance Provider 'e' (UnitedHealthcare). Only Gender matches, not Insurance.

Respondent 83: Gender 'a' (Female), Insurance 'e' (UnitedHealthcare). No.

Respondent 38: Gender 'b' (Male), Insurance 'a' (Aetna). Both conditions met. Count 1.

Respondent 17: Gender 'a' (Female), Insurance 'd' (Medicare). No.

Respondent 33: Gender 'b' (Male), Insurance 'a' (Aetna). Both conditions met. Count 2.

Respondent 71: Gender 'b' (Male), Insurance 'b' (Blue Cross). Insurance doesn't match.

Respondent 150: Gender 'b' (Male), Insurance 'd' (Medicare). No.

Respondent 141: Gender 'a' (Female), Insurance 'd' (Medicare). No.

Respondent 84: Gender 'b' (Male), Insurance 'c' (Cigna). No.

Respondent 98: Gender 'a' (Female), Insurance 'e' (UnitedHealthcare). No.

So, the respondents that meet both conditions are Respondent 38 and 33. That's a total of 2.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents have Gender = 'Male' and Admission Type = 'Urgent'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking how many respondents have Gender as 'Male' and Admission Type as 'Urgent'. 

First, I need to refer to the questions section to understand the mapping of the MCQ options. For Gender, the options are A. Female and B. Male. So, if a respondent's Gender is 'a', that's Female, and 'b' is Male. 

Next, Admission Type has options A. Elective, B. Emergency, C. Urgent. So, the code 'c' corresponds to Urgent.

Now, I need to go through each respondent in the responses section and check two things: their Gender and Admission Type. 

Let's look at each respondent one by one:

- **Respondent 117**: Gender is 'a' (Female), Admission Type 'a' (Elective). Doesn't meet the criteria.
- **Respondent 130**: Gender 'a' (Female), Admission Type 'a' (Elective). No match.
- **Respondent 111**: Gender 'a' (Female), Admission Type 'b' (Emergency). Not matching.
- **Respondent 26**: Gender 'a' (Female), Admission Type 'a' (Elective). Nope.
- **Respondent 30**: Gender 'a' (Female), Admission Type 'b' (Emergency). Still not.
- **Respondent 142**: Gender 'a' (Female), Admission Type 'a' (Elective). Doesn't fit.
- **Respondent 56**: Gender 'b' (Male), Admission Type 'c' (Urgent). This one matches both conditions.
- **Respondent 116**: Gender 'a' (Female), Admission Type 'c' (Urgent). Only Admission Type matches, but Gender is Female.
- **Respondent 59**: Gender 'a' (Female), Admission Type 'c' (Urgent). Again, only Admission Type matches.

So, out of all the respondents, only Respondent 56 has Gender 'Male' (code 'b') and Admission Type 'Urgent' (code 'c'). 

Therefore, the count should be 1.

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
How many respondents with Gender = 'Female' and Admission Type = 'Emergency' have a Billing Amount below 30000?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking for the number of respondents who are Female, had an Emergency admission type, and have a Billing Amount below 30,000. 

First, I need to refer to the questions section to understand the mapping of the MCQ options. 

Looking at the Gender question: it's MCQ with options A. Female and B. Male. So, in the responses, 'a' corresponds to Female and 'b' to Male. 

For Admission Type, the options are A. Elective, B. Emergency, C. Urgent. So, 'b' in the response maps to Emergency.

Now, I need to go through each respondent in the data and check if they meet all three conditions: Gender is Female (response 'a'), Admission Type is Emergency (response 'b'), and Billing Amount is less than 30,000.

Let's go through each respondent one by one:

Respondent 87:
- Gender: a → Female
- Admission Type: a → Elective (not Emergency)
- Billing Amount: 19581 (which is below 30k)
But since Admission Type is not Emergency, this doesn't count.

Respondent 117:
- Gender: a → Female
- Admission Type: a → Elective
- Billing Amount: 20228 (below 30k)
Again, Admission Type is Elective, so no.

Respondent 103:
- Gender: b → Male (doesn't meet Female condition)
- Skip.

Respondent 107:
- Gender: a → Female
- Admission Type: a → Elective
- Billing: 3326 (below 30k)
Admission Type not Emergency. Exclude.

Respondent 25:
- Gender: a → Female
- Admission Type: a → Elective
- Billing: 6313 (below 30k)
Still, Admission Type is Elective. No.

Respondent 81:
- Gender: a → Female
- Admission Type: b → Emergency
- Billing: 14681 (below 30k)
This meets all three conditions. Count 1.

Respondent 110:
- Gender: b → Male. Exclude.

Respondent 66:
- Gender: b → Male. Exclude.

Respondent 96:
- Gender: b → Male. Exclude.

Respondent 40:
- Gender: a → Female
- Admission Type: a → Elective
- Billing: 17696 (below 30k)
Admission Type not Emergency. Exclude.

Respondent 122:
- Gender: a → Female
- Admission Type: b → Emergency
- Billing: 48996 (above 30k)
Billing exceeds 30k. Exclude.

So, the only respondent that meets all criteria is Respondent 81. Therefore, the count is 1.

How many respondents from 'HOSP_96' are over the age of 60 and are not taking 'Aspirin'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find out how many respondents from 'HOSP_96' are over 60 years old and are not taking 'Aspirin'. 

First, I need to look through the responses and identify all respondents who are in HOSP_96. Let's check each respondent's Hospital entry.

Looking at the responses:

- Respondent 24: Hospital is HOSP_24. Not HOSP_96.
- Respondent 22: HOSP_22. Nope.
- Respondent 111: HOSP_111. Not the one.
- Respondent 25: HOSP_25. Still not.
- Respondent 96: Hospital is HOSP_96. Here's one.
- Respondent 34: HOSP_34. Not.

So only Respondent 96 is from HOSP_96. Now, check their age. The age is 18. That's way below 60. So even though they are in HOSP_96, they don't meet the age requirement. 

But wait, maybe I missed other respondents? Let me double-check. The data provided only has six respondents, and only Respondent 96 is in HOSP_96. Since their age is 18, which is under 60, there are no respondents from HOSP_96 over 60. 

Additionally, even if there were someone over 60 in HOSP_96, we need to check if they are not taking Aspirin. But since there are no such respondents in the data, the answer should be zero. 

Wait, let me confirm the medications. For Respondent 96, the Medication is 'a'. Looking at the schema for Medication: options are A. Aspirin, B. Ibuprofen, C. Lipitor, D. Paracetamol, E. Penicillin. So 'a' maps to Aspirin. The question asks for those NOT taking Aspirin. Since Respondent 96 is taking Aspirin, even if they were over 60 (which they aren't), they wouldn't count. 

So combining both conditions: must be in HOSP_96, age over 60, and not on Aspirin. There are no respondents meeting all three. Therefore, the answer is 0.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose length of stay is between 15 and 25 days and who were admitted for an 'Emergency' procedure.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents who meet two criteria: their length of stay is between 15 and 25 days, and they were admitted for an 'Emergency' procedure. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The questions section tells me that 'Admission Type' is an MCQ with options A. Elective, B. Emergency, C. Urgent. So, in the responses, if a respondent has Admission Type 'b', that maps to 'Emergency'. 

Next, the length of stay. The data provides 'Date of Admission' and 'Discharge Date' as open-ended fields. To calculate the length of stay, I need to compute the number of days between these two dates for each respondent. Then check if that number falls between 15 and 25 days, inclusive.

Let's go through each respondent one by one.

Starting with Respondent 144:
- Admission Date: 2022-09-22
- Discharge Date: 2022-11-07
Calculating the days between these dates. September has 30 days, so from Sept 22 to Sept 30 is 8 days. October has 31 days, so October adds 31 days. Then November 1 to November 7 is 7 days. Total: 8 + 31 + 7 = 46 days. That's way over 25, so this one doesn't qualify. Also, their Admission Type is 'c', which maps to 'Urgent' (from the schema), so even if the days were in range, it's not Emergency. So no.

Respondent 85:
- Admission: 2022-10-29
- Discharge: 2022-11-20
October 29 to October 31 is 3 days. November 1 to 20 is 20 days. Total 23 days. That's within 15-25. Admission Type is 'b' which is Emergency. So this one counts. So that's 1.

Respondent 32:
- Admission: 2024-01-15
- Discharge: 2024-02-24
January 15 to January 31 is 17 days (since 31-15=16, but including the 15th, so 17 days). February 1 to 24 is 24 days. Total 17+24=41 days. Over 25. Admission Type is 'c' (Urgent). So no.

Respondent 106:
- Admission: 2020-11-18
- Discharge: 2021-01-16
This spans from November 18, 2020, to January 16, 2021. November has 30 days, so 30 - 18 = 12 days left in November (including 18th: 13 days). December has 31 days. January 16 days. Total: 13 +31 +16 = 60 days. Way over. Admission Type is 'a' (Elective). So no.

Respondent 91:
- Admission: 2022-07-08
- Discharge: 2022-06-30
Wait, the discharge date is before the admission date? That's impossible. Maybe a typo? Let me check again. The admission date is 2022-07-08 (July 8th) and discharge is 2022-06-30 (June 30th). That's negative days. This must be an error in data entry. Since the discharge is before admission, the length of stay would be negative, which doesn't make sense. So this respondent's data is invalid for calculating length of stay. So we can't count this one. Also, their Admission Type is 'a' (Elective), so even if the dates were correct, it's not Emergency. So no.

So the only respondent that meets both criteria is Respondent 85. Therefore, the count is 1.

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".

<task>
How many respondents with Gender = 'Female' and Admission Type = 'Emergency' have a Billing Amount below 30000?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find out how many respondents are Female, had an Emergency admission type, and have a Billing Amount below 30,000. 

First, I need to refer to the questions section to understand the mapping of the MCQ options. 

For Gender, the options are A. Female and B. Male. So, in the responses, 'a' corresponds to Female and 'b' to Male. 

Admission Type has options A. Elective, B. Emergency, C. Urgent. So, 'b' in the responses for Admission Type means Emergency.

Now, looking at each respondent's data:

Starting with Respondent 14: Gender is 'a' (Female), Admission Type is 'a' (Elective). Billing Amount is 21186. So, Admission Type isn't Emergency. Doesn't count.

Respondent 74: Gender 'b' (Male), so skip.

Respondent 80: Gender 'b' (Male), skip.

Respondent 91: Gender 'a' (Female), Admission Type 'a' (Elective). Billing 26787. Not Emergency. Doesn't count.

Respondent 27: Gender 'a' (Female), Admission Type 'b' (Emergency). Billing 30591. Wait, 30591 is above 30,000? No, 30,591 is over 30k. So even though Gender and Admission Type match, the billing is over. So exclude.

Respondent 148: Gender 'b' (Male), skip.

Respondent 130: Gender 'a' (Female), Admission Type 'a' (Elective). Billing 34618. Not Emergency, so no.

Respondent 55: Gender 'b', skip.

Respondent 40: Gender 'a' (Female), Admission Type 'a' (Elective). Billing 17696. Admission Type is Elective, so no.

Respondent 124: Gender 'b', skip.

Respondent 58: Gender 'b', skip.

Wait, did I miss anyone? Let me check again.

Wait, Respondent 27: Billing is 30591. That's over 30,000. So even though Gender is Female and Admission Type is Emergency, the billing is over. So no.

Are there any other Female respondents with Admission Type Emergency and billing under 30k?

Looking through all the respondents again:

Respondent 14: Female, Elective, 21186. No.

Respondent 27: Female, Emergency, 30591. Over 30k. No.

Any others? Let's check all:

Respondent 74: Male, so no.

Respondent 80: Male.

Respondent 91: Female, Elective.

Respondent 148: Male.

Respondent 130: Female, Elective.

Respondent 55: Male.

Respondent 40: Female, Elective.

Respondent 124: Male.

Respondent 58: Male.

So the only possible candidate is Respondent 27, but their billing is over 30k. So there are zero respondents that meet all three criteria. Wait, but wait, let me check the billing amounts again.

Wait, Respondent 14's billing is 21186, which is below 30k, but their Admission Type is Elective. So no.

Respondent 40: Billing 17696, which is below 30k, but Admission Type is Elective. So no.

Is there any Female with Admission Type Emergency and billing under 30k? From the data provided, it seems not. Therefore, the answer should be 0.

<task>
How many respondents with Gender = 'Female' and Admission Type = 'Elective' have a Billing Amount below 40000?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking for the number of respondents who are Female, had an Elective Admission Type, and have a Billing Amount below 40,000. 

First, I need to refer to the schema to understand the MCQ options. 

Looking at the Gender question: options are A. Female and B. Male. So, in the responses, 'a' corresponds to Female and 'b' to Male. 

For Admission Type, the options are A. Elective, B. Emergency, C. Urgent. So, 'a' in the response means Elective.

Now, I need to go through each respondent and check if they meet all three conditions: Gender is Female (response 'a'), Admission Type is Elective (response 'a'), and Billing Amount is less than 40,000.

Let's check each respondent one by one:

Respondent 90:
- Gender: a → Female
- Admission Type: c → Urgent (not Elective)
- Billing Amount: 25230 → which is below 40k. But since Admission Type isn't Elective, this doesn't count.

Respondent 143:
- Gender: b → Male. So, doesn't meet the Female condition. Skip.

Respondent 95:
- Gender: a → Female
- Admission Type: a → Elective
- Billing Amount: 26062 → below 40k. This one meets all conditions. Count = 1.

Respondent 30:
- Gender: a → Female
- Admission Type: b → Emergency. Doesn't meet Elective. Skip.

Respondent 72:
- Gender: a → Female
- Admission Type: b → Emergency. Skip.

Respondent 147:
- Gender: a → Female
- Admission Type: b → Emergency. Skip.

So, only Respondent 95 meets all three criteria. Therefore, the answer should be 1.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose length of stay is between 10 and 20 days and who were admitted for an 'Emergency' procedure.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents who stayed in the hospital between 10 and 20 days and were admitted for an 'Emergency' procedure. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The questions section tells me that 'Admission Type' is an MCQ with options A. Elective, B. Emergency, C. Urgent. So, any respondent with Admission Type 'b' corresponds to Emergency.

Next, the length of stay is calculated by the difference between Discharge Date and Date of Admission. Both dates are provided in the responses as YYYY-MM-DD format. I need to compute the number of days each respondent stayed and check if it's between 10 and 20 days inclusive.

Let's go through each respondent one by one.

**Respondent 110:**
- Admission Date: 2019-12-12
- Discharge Date: 2019-08-21
Wait, that's impossible. The discharge date is before the admission date. That must be a typo. Maybe the dates are swapped? Let me check the original data again. The respondent's admission is 2019-12-12 and discharge 2019-08-21. That's a negative duration. Maybe a data entry error. Since the discharge is before admission, the length of stay is negative, which doesn't make sense. So this respondent's data is invalid for this calculation. We'll exclude them or consider 0 days, which doesn't meet the 10-20 day requirement.

**Respondent 144:**
- Admission: 2022-09-22
- Discharge: 2022-11-07
Calculating the days between these dates. From September 22 to November 7. September has 30 days, so from 22 to 30 is 8 days (including 22?), then October has 31 days, and November 7 days. Total: 8 (Sept) + 31 (Oct) +7 (Nov) = 46 days. That's way over 20. So no.

**Respondent 143:**
- Admission: 2022-12-10
- Discharge: 2022-09-27
Again, discharge is before admission. Another data error. So invalid, length of stay negative. Exclude.

**Respondent 7:**
- Admission: 2021-03-05
- Discharge: 2021-03-05
Same day discharge. 0 days. Doesn't meet the criteria.

**Respondent 69:**
- Admission: 2022-01-09
- Discharge: 2022-01-12
Calculating days: 12 - 9 = 3 days (since same month). 3 days. Not between 10-20.

**Respondent 8:**
- Admission: 2022-06-17
- Discharge: 2022-09-07
Let's calculate. From June 17 to June 30: 13 days (including 17th). July: 31, August: 31, September 7. Total: 13 +31 +31 +7 = 82 days. Way over.

**Respondent 47:**
- Admission: 2024-04-07
- Discharge: 2024-03-28
Again, discharge before admission. Negative days. Invalid.

**Respondent 70:**
- Admission: 2019-07-09
- Discharge: 2019-09-01
July 9 to July 31: 22 days (including 9th). August: 31 days. September 1: 1 day. Total: 22 +31 +1 = 54 days. Over 20.

Now, check the Admission Type for each. The question requires 'Emergency' which is option B. Let's check each respondent's Admission Type:

- Respondent 110: Admission Type 'a' → Elective. Not Emergency.
- Respondent 144: Admission Type 'c' → Urgent. No.
- Respondent 143: Admission Type 'b' → Emergency. But their dates are invalid, so even if Admission Type is correct, the length of stay is invalid. So no.
- Respondent 7: Admission Type 'b' → Emergency. But stay is 0 days. Doesn't meet.
- Respondent 69: Admission Type 'b' → Emergency. Stay is 3 days. No.
- Respondent 8: Admission Type 'a' → Elective. No.
- Respondent 47: Admission Type 'c' → Urgent. No.
- Respondent 70: Admission Type 'a' → Elective. No.

Wait, so none of the respondents with valid dates and Emergency admission type have a length of stay between 10-20 days. But let me double-check if I missed any.

Looking again:

Only respondents with Admission Type 'b' (Emergency) are:

- Respondent 143: Admission Type 'b', but dates invalid.
- Respondent 7: Admission Type 'b', stay 0 days.
- Respondent 69: Admission Type 'b', stay 3 days.
- Respondent 70: Admission Type 'a' (Elective). No.

So none of the Emergency admissions have a valid length of stay between 10-20 days. Therefore, the count is 0.

But wait, maybe I made a mistake in date calculations. Let me recheck one example. For example, Respondent 7: admitted and discharged on the same day. Correct. Respondent 69: admitted 2022-01-09, discharged 2022-01-12. That's 3 days (9,10,11,12? Wait, from 9th to 12th is 3 days (since 12-9=3). So yes, 3 days. Correct.

So the answer is 0.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose length of stay is between 15 and 25 days and who were admitted for an 'Emergency' procedure.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents who stayed between 15 and 25 days and were admitted for an 'Emergency' procedure. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The questions section tells me that 'Admission Type' is an MCQ with options A. Elective, B. Emergency, C. Urgent. So, any respondent with Admission Type 'b' corresponds to Emergency.

Next, I need to calculate the length of stay for each respondent. The dates provided are 'Date of Admission' and 'Discharge Date'. The length of stay is the number of days between these two dates. 

Let me go through each respondent one by one:

**Respondent 87:**
- Admission Date: 2023-04-09
- Discharge Date: 2023-01-27
Wait, the discharge date is before the admission date? That doesn't make sense. Maybe it's a typo. Perhaps the dates are swapped? If the discharge is earlier than admission, the length would be negative, which isn't possible. This might be an error in the data. For the sake of analysis, maybe I should skip this one or assume it's a mistake. But since the problem doesn't mention handling errors, I'll note this but proceed with the calculation as per the given dates. The difference between 2023-04-09 and 2023-01-27 is negative, so maybe 0 days. But this is unclear. Hmm, perhaps this respondent's data is invalid, but the problem might expect us to process it as is. Let's keep this in mind.

**Respondent 90:**
- Admission: 2021-09-15
- Discharge: 2021-05-29
Again, discharge is before admission. Same issue. So length is negative. Not possible. Maybe another data entry error. 

**Respondent 2:**
- Admission: 2021-01-21
- Discharge: 2020-08-27
Again, discharge is before admission. This seems like a recurring problem. Maybe the dates are in a different format? Like day-month-year instead of year-month-day? Let's check. For example, if the admission is 2021-01-21 (assuming YYYY-MM-DD), discharge is 2020-08-27, which is definitely before. So this can't be right. Maybe the dates are in MM-DD-YYYY format? Let's see. If Admission is 04-09-2023 (April 9) and Discharge is 01-27-2023 (January 27), then the discharge is still before. So regardless of format, the discharge is before admission. This suggests that these entries have incorrect dates, but since the problem doesn't mention handling this, perhaps we should proceed under the assumption that the dates are correct as given. But that would mean the length of stay is negative, which isn't possible. Therefore, these respondents might be excluded from the count. Alternatively, maybe the dates are in a different format. Let's try switching day and month. For example, Respondent 87: Admission 2023-04-09 (April 9) and Discharge 2023-01-27 (January 27). If the dates are in YYYY-DD-MM format, then Admission would be 2023-09-04 (September 4) and Discharge 2023-27-01 (invalid). That doesn't work. Alternatively, maybe the dates are in DD-MM-YYYY. So Admission 09-04-2023 (9 April 2023) and Discharge 27-01-2023 (27 January 2023). Then the discharge is still before admission. So regardless, the dates are invalid. This is a problem. Since the problem doesn't specify how to handle such cases, perhaps we should proceed with the given dates as they are, but that would mean the length of stay is negative, so they don't fall into the 15-25 day range. Therefore, these respondents would not be counted. 

Moving on to other respondents where the dates might be valid:

**Respondent 37:**
- Admission: 2022-05-12
- Discharge: 2022-07-18
Calculating the days between May 12 and July 18, 2022. Let's compute:
From May 12 to May 31: 20 days (including 12th)
June has 30 days
July 1 to July 18: 18 days
Total: 20 + 30 + 18 = 68 days. That's way over 25. So not in the range.

**Respondent 145:**
- Admission: 2020-11-03
- Discharge: 2020-09-04
Again, discharge before admission. Negative days. So invalid.

**Respondent 103:**
- Admission: 2023-10-11
- Discharge: 2024-01-19
This is a valid date. Let's calculate the days from October 11, 2023, to January 19, 2024.
October: 31 days. From 11th to 31st: 21 days (including 11th)
November: 30
December: 31
January: 19
Total: 21 +30 +31 +19 = 101 days. Over 25.

**Respondent 18:**
- Admission: 2019-08-18
- Discharge: 2019-11-22
August 18 to August 31: 14 days (including 18th)
September: 30
October: 31
November: 22
Total: 14 +30 +31 +22 = 97 days. Over 25.

**Respondent 8:**
- Admission: 2022-06-17
- Discharge: 2022-09-07
June 17 to June 30: 14 days (including 17th)
July: 31
August: 31
September: 7
Total: 14 +31 +31 +7 = 83 days. Over 25.

Wait, all the respondents so far either have discharge dates before admission (invalid) or length of stay over 25 days. But the example given in the initial problem had an answer of 1. Let me check again. Maybe I missed a respondent.

Wait, looking back at the data, let's check all respondents again:

Wait, the respondents listed are 87,90,2,47,37,145,103,18,8. Let me check each again.

**Respondent 47:**
- Admission: 2024-04-07
- Discharge: 2024-03-28
Again, discharge before admission. Negative days.

**Respondent 2:**
- Admission: 2021-01-21
- Discharge: 2020-08-27. Discharge before admission.

**Respondent 37:**
As before, 68 days.

**Respondent 8:**
83 days.

So all the respondents in the data provided have either invalid dates (discharge before admission) or length of stay exceeding 25 days. But the example answer was 1. However, in the example, the answer was for a different question (Gender Male and Hypertension). Now, the current task is different. 

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the data. Let me check the data again carefully.

Looking at the current questionnaire data:

The respondents are 87,90,2,47,37,145,103,18,8.

Wait, perhaps I missed a respondent. Let me count again. The list includes:

Respondent 87, 90, 2, 47, 37, 145, 103, 18, 8. That's 9 respondents.

Wait, but in the example, the answer was 1, but that was for a different question. Now, the current task is to find those with length of stay 15-25 days and Emergency admission.

But according to the data, all the respondents with Admission Type 'b' (Emergency) are:

Looking at each respondent's Admission Type:

Respondent 87: a (Elective)
Respondent 90: c (Urgent)
Respondent 2: b (Emergency)
Respondent 47: c (Urgent)
Respondent 37: b (Emergency)
Respondent 145: c (Urgent)
Respondent 103: b (Emergency)
Respondent 18: b (Emergency)
Respondent 8: a (Elective)

So respondents with Admission Type 'b' (Emergency) are 2,37,103,18.

Now, for these four respondents, check their length of stay.

Respondent 2: Admission 2021-01-21, Discharge 2020-08-27. Discharge before admission. Negative days. So invalid. Exclude.

Respondent 37: Admission 2022-05-12, Discharge 2022-07-18. As before, 68 days. Over 25.

Respondent 103: Admission 2023-10-11, Discharge 2024-01-19. 101 days. Over 25.

Respondent 18: Admission 2019-08-18, Discharge 2019-11-22. 97 days. Over 25.

So none of the Emergency admissions have a length of stay between 15-25 days. But that can't be right. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in date calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, perhaps the dates are in a different format. For example, maybe the dates are in MM-DD-YYYY instead of YYYY-MM-DD. Let's test that.

Take Respondent 2: Admission Date: 2021-01-21. If that's January 21, 2021. Discharge Date: 2020-08-27. If that's August 27, 2020. So discharge is before admission. Still invalid.

Alternatively, if the dates are in DD-MM-YYYY format. For example, Admission 21-01-2021 (21 January 2021) and Discharge 27-08-2020 (27 August 2020). Still discharge before admission.

So regardless of date format, the discharge is before admission. Therefore, these entries are invalid, and their length of stay is negative. So they can't be in the 15-25 day range.

Therefore, there are zero respondents who meet the criteria. But that seems odd. However, according to the data provided, that's the case. But maybe I missed a respondent. Let me check all respondents again.

Wait, the data provided in the questionnaire includes 9 respondents. Let me list them all with their Admission Type and dates:

1. Respondent 87: Admission Type a (Elective). Dates: 2023-04-09 to 2023-01-27 (invalid).
2. Respondent 90: Type c (Urgent). Dates 2021-09-15 to 2021-05-29 (invalid).
3. Respondent 2: Type b (Emergency). Dates 2021-01-21 to 2020-08-27 (invalid).
4. Respondent 47: Type c (Urgent). Dates 2024-04-07 to 2024-03-28 (invalid, discharge before).
5. Respondent 37: Type b (Emergency). Dates 2022-05-12 to 2022-07-18. Valid. 68 days.
6. Respondent 145: Type c (Urgent). Dates 2020-11-03 to 2020-09-04 (invalid).
7. Respondent 103: Type b (Emergency). Dates 2023-10-11 to 2024-01-19. Valid. 101 days.
8. Respondent 18: Type b (Emergency). Dates 2019-08-18 to 2019-11-22. Valid. 97 days.
9. Respondent 8: Type a (Elective). Dates 2022-06-17 to 2022-09-07. Valid. 83 days.

So among Emergency admissions (Type b), respondents 2,37,103,18. But only 37,103,18 have valid dates (2 is invalid). Their stays are 68, 101, 97 days. All over 25. So none are between 15-25 days. 

Therefore, the count is 0. But the example had an answer of 1, but that was for a different question. So in this case, the answer should be 0. But maybe I made a mistake in date calculation. Let me recheck one of them.

Take Respondent 37: Admission 2022-05-12, Discharge 2022-07-18.

From May 12 to July 18:

May has 31 days. From May 12 to May 31: 20 days (including 12th)
June: 30 days
July 1 to July 18: 18 days
Total: 20 +30 +18 = 68 days. Correct.

Another example: Respondent 103: Admission 2023-10-11 to 2024-01-19.

October 11 to October 31: 21 days
November: 30
December: 31
January: 19
Total: 21+30+31+19=101. Correct.

So no one meets the criteria. Therefore, the answer is 0.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose length of stay is between 10 and 20 days and who were admitted for an 'Elective' procedure.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents who stayed between 10 and 20 days and were admitted for an 'Elective' procedure. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The questions section tells me that 'Admission Type' is an MCQ with options A. Elective, B. Emergency, C. Urgent. So, in the responses, if someone has Admission Type 'a', that maps to Elective.

Next, each respondent has a Date of Admission and a Discharge Date. To find the length of stay, I need to calculate the number of days between these two dates. The dates are in the format YYYY-MM-DD. 

Let's go through each respondent one by one:

**Respondent 136:**
- Admission Date: 2023-06-25
- Discharge Date: 2023-07-05
Calculating the days between these dates. June has 30 days, so from June 25 to June 30 is 5 days. Then July 1 to July 5 is 5 days. Total 10 days. 
Admission Type is 'c', which maps to Urgent. So this doesn't meet the criteria.

**Respondent 56:**
- Admission: 2020-01-30
- Discharge: 2020-06-01
Wait, that's a big gap. Let me check the dates. From January 30 to June 1. Let's calculate the days. January has 31 days, so 30th to 31st is 1 day. Then February (2020 is a leap year, so 29 days), March (31), April (30), May (31), and June 1. So total days: 1 (Jan) + 29 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 1 = 123 days. That's way over 20. Admission Type is 'c' (Urgent). Doesn't qualify.

**Respondent 97:**
- Admission: 2020-07-01
- Discharge: 2020-03-05. Wait, that's impossible. The discharge date is before the admission date. That must be a typo. Maybe the dates are swapped? Let me check the original data again. The admission is 2020-07-01 and discharge is 2020-03-05. That can't be right. Maybe it's a mistake in the data entry. Since the discharge is before admission, the length of stay would be negative, which doesn't make sense. Perhaps it's a typo, but since we have to work with the given data, this respondent's stay is invalid. So we can't count them. Admission Type is 'a' (Elective), but the dates are conflicting. So exclude this one.

**Respondent 108:**
- Admission: 2020-08-11
- Discharge: 2020-07-20. Again, discharge before admission. Another data inconsistency. So same issue as Respondent 97. Admission Type is 'a' (Elective), but the dates are invalid. Exclude.

**Respondent 117:**
- Admission: 2021-01-17
- Discharge: 2021-07-31. Let's calculate. From Jan 17 to July 31. January has 31 days, so 14 days left in Jan. Then February (28, 2021 not a leap year), March (31), April (30), May (31), June (30), July 31. So 14 + 28 +31+30+31+30+31= 195 days. Way over 20. Admission Type 'a' (Elective). But length is too long. Doesn't qualify.

**Respondent 88:**
- Admission: 2023-06-08
- Discharge: 2023-07-02. June 8 to June 30 is 22 days, plus July 2 is 2 days. Total 24 days. That's over 20. Admission Type 'a' (Elective). So 24 days is more than 20, so no.

Wait, but the task is to find those with length of stay between 10 and 20 days inclusive? Let me check the first respondent again. Respondent 136 had 10 days. But their admission type was 'c' (Urgent), so they don't count. 

Looking at all respondents, none of them with Admission Type 'a' (Elective) have a valid length of stay between 10 and 20 days. The only Elective cases are Respondents 97, 108, 117, 88. 

But Respondent 97 and 108 have discharge dates before admission, which is impossible. So their stays are invalid. Respondent 117's stay is 195 days, way over. Respondent 88's stay is 24 days, which is over 20. 

So there are no respondents that meet both criteria. Therefore, the answer should be 0.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents with Gender = 'Male' and Admission Type = 'Elective' have a Billing Amount below 30000?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking for the number of respondents who are Male, had an Elective Admission Type, and have a Billing Amount below 30,000. 

First, I need to refer back to the schema to make sure I understand the codes. For Gender, the options are A. Female and B. Male. So, in the responses, if Gender is 'a', that's Female, and 'b' is Male. Similarly, Admission Type is MCQ with options A. Elective, B. Emergency, C. Urgent. So 'a' in the response corresponds to Elective.

Now, I need to go through each respondent and check these three conditions: Gender is Male (so response 'b'), Admission Type is Elective (response 'a'), and Billing Amount is less than 30,000.

Looking at the respondents one by one:

Respondent 95: Gender is 'a' (Female) – doesn't meet the Male condition. Skip.

Respondent 80: Gender is 'b' (Male). Admission Type is 'c' (Urgent). So Admission Type isn't Elective. Skip.

Respondent 84: Gender 'b' (Male). Admission Type 'c' (Urgent). Again, not Elective. Skip.

Respondent 146: Gender 'a' (Female). Skip.

Respondent 22: Gender 'b' (Male). Admission Type 'c' (Urgent). Billing is 5998, which is below 30k. But Admission Type is not Elective. So no.

Respondent 14: Gender 'a' (Female). Skip.

Respondent 40: Gender 'a' (Female). Skip.

Wait, did I miss any? Let me check again. The respondents are 95, 80, 84, 146, 22, 14, 40. 

Looking for Male (Gender 'b') and Admission Type 'a' (Elective). Let's check each:

- Respondent 95: Gender 'a' (Female) – no.
- Respondent 80: Gender 'b' (Male), Admission Type 'c' (Urgent) – no.
- Respondent 84: Gender 'b', Admission Type 'c' – no.
- Respondent 22: Gender 'b', Admission Type 'c' – no.
- The others are Female. 

Wait, none of the Male respondents have Admission Type 'a' (Elective). So the count would be zero. But let me double-check the Billing Amount just in case. Even if there were any, but in this case, there are none. So the answer is 0.

<task>
Count the respondents whose length of stay is between 10 and 30 days and who were admitted for an 'Elective' procedure.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents who stayed in the hospital between 10 and 30 days and were admitted for an 'Elective' procedure. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The questions section tells me that Admission Type is an MCQ with options A. Elective, B. Emergency, C. Urgent. So, in the responses, if someone has Admission Type 'a', that maps to Elective.

Next, I need to calculate the length of stay for each respondent. The data provided includes Date of Admission and Discharge Date. The length of stay is the number of days between these two dates. 

Let me go through each respondent one by one:

**Respondent 13:**
- Admission Date: 2020-05-31
- Discharge Date: 2020-06-19
Let's calculate the days between these dates. From May 31 to June 19. May has 31 days, so May 31 to June 1 is 1 day. Then from June 1 to June 19 is 18 days. Total 1 + 18 = 19 days. 
Admission Type is 'b', which maps to Emergency. So this doesn't qualify.

**Respondent 21:**
- Admission Date: 2021-11-13
- Discharge Date: 2021-08-19
Wait, the discharge date is before the admission date? That's impossible. Maybe a typo? Let me check again. The admission is 2021-11-13 and discharge is 2021-08-19. That would mean the discharge was before admission, which can't be right. Perhaps the dates are swapped? Or maybe a data entry error. Since the discharge is earlier, the length of stay would be negative, which doesn't make sense. Maybe this is an error, but I have to work with the data as given. So length of stay is negative, which can't be between 10-30 days. Also, Admission Type is 'b' (Emergency). So this doesn't count.

**Respondent 70:**
- Admission: 2019-07-09
- Discharge: 2019-09-01
Calculating the days: July has 31 days. From July 9 to July 31: 31 - 9 = 22 days. Then August has 31 days, so from August 1 to September 1 is 31 days. Wait, no. September 1 is the discharge date. So July 9 to July 31 is 22 days, August has 31 days, so up to August 31 is 22 + 31 = 53 days, plus September 1 is another day, total 54 days. That's over 30. Admission Type is 'a' (Elective). But since the stay is 54 days, which is more than 30, it doesn't qualify.

**Respondent 114:**
- Admission: 2024-01-04
- Discharge: 2023-11-08
Again, discharge is before admission. 2023 is before 2024. So negative days. Admission Type 'a' (Elective). But the stay is negative, so doesn't count.

**Respondent 109:**
- Admission: 2022-05-13
- Discharge: 2022-06-10
Calculate days: From May 13 to May 31: 31 -13 = 18 days. Then June 1 to June 10 is 10 days. Total 18 +10 = 28 days. Admission Type 'a' (Elective). So 28 days is between 10 and 30. This qualifies. Count 1.

**Respondent 125:**
- Admission: 2020-03-08
- Discharge: 2020-02-12
Again, discharge before admission. Negative days. Admission Type 'a' (Elective). Doesn't count.

**Respondent 107:**
- Admission: 2024-01-31
- Discharge: 2024-02-02
Days between: January 31 to February 2. January has 31 days, so 1 day (Feb 1) plus 1 day (Feb 2) = 2 days. Admission Type 'a' (Elective). But 2 days is less than 10. Doesn't qualify.

So the only one that meets the criteria is Respondent 109. Therefore, the count is 1.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose length of stay is between 5 and 35 days and who were admitted for an 'Emergency' procedure.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents who meet two criteria: their length of stay is between 5 and 35 days, and they were admitted for an 'Emergency' procedure. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The questions section tells me that Admission Type is an MCQ with options A. Elective, B. Emergency, C. Urgent. So, in the responses, if Admission Type is 'b', that maps to Emergency.

Next, the length of stay (LOS) isn't a direct field, so I need to calculate it using the Date of Admission and Discharge Date. The LOS is the number of days between these two dates. The requirement is that LOS is between 5 and 35 days inclusive.

Let me go through each respondent one by one.

Starting with Respondent 56:
- Admission Date: 2020-01-30
- Discharge Date: 2020-06-01
Calculating the days between these dates. Let's see, from January 30 to June 1. 2020 is a leap year, so February has 29 days. Let's compute:
January: 30th to 31st is 1 day (since 31-30=1, but including both days would be 2 days? Wait, maybe I should use a date difference calculator method. The exact number of days between 2020-01-30 and 2020-06-01. Let's count:
From Jan 30 to Jan 31: 1 day
February: 29 days (leap year)
March: 31 days
April: 30 days
May: 31 days
June 1: 1 day
So total days: (1) + 29 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 1? Wait, no. Wait, the difference between two dates is discharge date minus admission date. Let's compute it properly. Using a date calculator, from 2020-01-30 to 2020-06-01: that's 123 days. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, let me check:

January 30 to June 1 is 4 months and 2 days. But months vary. Let's calculate day by day:

From 2020-01-30 to 2020-06-01:

January: 30th to 31st = 2 days (30th and 31st)
February: 29 days
March: 31
April: 30
May: 31
June 1: 1 day

Wait, but from Jan 30 to June 1, it's 30 (Jan) to 1 (June). Let's compute the total days:

Days in each month after January: Feb (29) + March (31) + April (30) + May (31) = 29+31=60, 60+30=90, 90+31=121. Then add the days from January: 2 (30 and 31) and June 1. So total days: 2 + 121 +1 = 124 days? Wait, but the discharge date is June 1, so the stay is from Jan 30 (inclusive) to June 1 (inclusive). Let me use a date difference calculator formula. The formula is (Discharge Date - Admission Date). For example, in Python, (2020-06-01 - 2020-01-30).days would give 123 days. So the LOS is 123 days. That's way over 35, so this respondent doesn't qualify.

Admission Type for Respondent 56 is 'c', which maps to Urgent (from the MCQ options: A. Elective, B. Emergency, C. Urgent). So even if the LOS was within range, the Admission Type isn't Emergency. So this one is out.

Next, Respondent 132:
Admission Date: 2021-08-02
Discharge Date: 2021-08-13
Calculating LOS: 13 - 2 = 11 days (since both dates are in August). Wait, from August 2 to August 13 is 11 days (including both days: 13-2=11, but since both days are included, it's 12 days? Wait, 2nd to 3rd is 1 day, so 2nd to 13th is 12 days. Let me check: 13 - 2 = 11, but since the admission day counts as day 1, the total days would be 12. So LOS is 12-2+1=12 days. Wait, maybe better to compute using actual dates. August 2 to August 13: 11 days (since 13-2=11, but including both days would be 12 days). Hmm, perhaps I should use a calculator. Let's see: from 2021-08-02 to 2021-08-13. The number of days is 11 days (since day 2 is day 1, day 3 is day 2, ..., day 13 is day 12). Wait, no. The correct way is discharge date minus admission date. So 13 - 2 = 11 days. But in reality, if you're admitted on the 2nd and discharged on the 13th, that's 11 days in the hospital. So LOS is 11 days. That's between 5 and 35. 

Admission Type is 'c' (Urgent), so not Emergency. So this respondent doesn't qualify.

Respondent 30:
Admission Date: 2023-05-24
Discharge Date: 2023-06-15
Calculating LOS: From May 24 to June 15. May has 31 days, so 31 -24 =7 days in May, plus 15 in June: 7 +15 =22 days. So LOS is 22 days. That's within 5-35. 

Admission Type is 'b' which is Emergency. So this respondent meets both criteria. Count 1.

Respondent 89:
Admission Date: 2022-10-18
Discharge Date: 2022-11-11
LOS: October 18 to November 11. October has 31 days. 31-18=13 days in October, plus 11 in November: 13+11=24 days. LOS is 24 days. Within range. 

Admission Type is 'b' (Emergency). So this respondent qualifies. Count 2.

Respondent 111:
Admission Date: 2022-03-12
Discharge Date: 2022-06-24
LOS: Let's calculate. March 12 to March 31: 20 days (31-12+1=20). April:30, May:31, June:24. Total: 20+30+31+24= 105 days. Over 35. So excluded. Admission Type is 'b' (Emergency), but LOS is too long. Doesn't count.

Respondent 29:
Admission Date: 2019-12-02
Discharge Date: 2019-09-06. Wait, wait, that's impossible. The discharge date is before the admission date. That must be a typo. The admission is 2019-12-02 (December 2, 2019) and discharge is 2019-09-06 (September 6, 2019). That's not possible. Maybe the dates are swapped? Or a data entry error. Since the discharge date is before admission, the LOS would be negative. But since the data is given as such, perhaps we have to consider it as is, but that would result in a negative LOS. However, in real scenarios, this would be an error, but according to the data provided, we have to proceed. So LOS is (2019-09-06 - 2019-12-02) which is negative. So LOS is negative, which is less than 5. So this respondent doesn't qualify. Admission Type is 'c' (Urgent). So no.

Respondent 73:
Admission Date: 2024-01-05
Discharge Date: 2024-03-26
LOS: From Jan 5 to March 26. 2024 is a leap year. January: 31-5=26 days (Jan 5 to Jan 31: 27 days including both), February: 29 days, March:26 days. Total: 26 +29 +26 =81 days. Over 35. Admission Type 'a' (Elective). Doesn't qualify.

Respondent 125:
Admission Date: 2020-03-08
Discharge Date: 2020-02-12. Again, discharge before admission. Negative LOS. So LOS is negative. Admission Type 'a' (Elective). Doesn't count.

Respondent 135:
Admission Date: 2023-11-12
Discharge Date: 2023-06-01. Again, discharge is before admission. Negative LOS. Admission Type 'a' (Elective). Doesn't qualify.

So, the only respondents who meet both criteria are Respondent 30 and Respondent 89. That's a total of 2.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents from 'HOSP_53' are over the age of 65 and are not taking 'Aspirin'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find out how many respondents from 'HOSP_53' are over 65 years old and are not taking 'Aspirin'. 

First, I need to look through all the respondents and check two things: their hospital, their age, and their medication. Let's start by going through each respondent one by one.

Looking at the list of respondents: 12, 57, 102, 15, 2, 53, 78, 55, 36. 

Starting with Respondent 12: Hospital is HOSP_12. Not HOSP_53, so skip.

Respondent 57: Hospital HOSP_57. Not the one we need.

Respondent 102: HOSP_102. Nope.

Respondent 15: HOSP_15. Still not.

Respondent 2: HOSP_02. Not matching.

Respondent 53: Here, the hospital is HOSP_53. Let's check this one. Age is 38. The question requires age over 65. 38 is way below, so even though the hospital matches, the age doesn't. So this one doesn't count.

Respondent 78: HOSP_78. Not our target.

Respondent 55: HOSP_55. No.

Respondent 36: HOSP_36. Not it.

So, only Respondent 53 is from HOSP_53. But their age is 38, which is under 65. So even if their medication isn't Aspirin, they don't meet the age criteria. 

Wait, are there any other respondents from HOSP_53? Let me double-check. The list given has only one respondent (53) in HOSP_53. 

Now, checking the medication for Respondent 53: The medication is 'b'. Looking at the schema for Medication, the options are A. Aspirin, B. Ibuprofen, etc. So 'b' maps to Ibuprofen. Therefore, they are not taking Aspirin. But their age is 38, which is under 65. So they don't meet the age requirement. 

Are there any other respondents in HOSP_53? The data provided doesn't show any others. So the count would be zero. 

Wait, let me check again. Maybe I missed someone. Let me go through each respondent's hospital again:

Respondent 12: HOSP_12

57: HOSP_57

102: HOSP_102

15: HOSP_15

2: HOSP_02

53: HOSP_53

78: HOSP_78

55: HOSP_55

36: HOSP_36

No others. So only Respondent 53 is in HOSP_53, but age is 38. Therefore, no one from HOSP_53 is over 65. Hence, the answer is 0.

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
How many respondents from 'HOSP_34' are over the age of 50 and are not taking 'Aspirin'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find out how many respondents from 'HOSP_34' are over the age of 50 and are not taking 'Aspirin'. 

First, I need to look through the responses provided and filter them based on the criteria. Let's start by identifying all respondents who are in 'HOSP_34'. 

Looking at each respondent's data:

- Respondent 75: Hospital is HOSP_75. Not HOSP_34.
- Respondent 84: HOSP_84. Nope.
- Respondent 31: HOSP_31. Not the one.
- Respondent 2: HOSP_02. Not HOSP_34.
- Respondent 128: HOSP_128. No.
- Respondent 111: HOSP_111. Not here.
- Respondent 45: HOSP_45. Not matching.
- Respondent 34: Hospital is HOSP_34. Yes, this one is from HOSP_34.
- Respondent 98: HOSP_98. No.

So only Respondent 34 is from HOSP_34. Now, check their age. The age given is 20. That's not over 50. So even though they are from HOSP_34, they don't meet the age requirement. 

Since there are no other respondents from HOSP_34, the count would be zero. But wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss any other respondents. The list provided includes up to Respondent 98, and the only one in HOSP_34 is Respondent 34. 

Additionally, even if there were others, the age and medication need to be checked. For Respondent 34, their medication is 'd', which according to the Medication MCQ options (A. Aspirin B. Ibuprofen C. Lipitor D. Paracetamol E. Penicillin), 'd' corresponds to Paracetamol. So they are not taking Aspirin, but their age is 20, which is under 50. 

Therefore, there are no respondents from HOSP_34 over 50 not taking Aspirin. The answer should be 0.

<task>
How many respondents with Gender = 'Male' and Admission Type = 'Emergency' have a Billing Amount below 40000?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the number of respondents who are Male, have an Admission Type of Emergency, and a Billing Amount below 40,000. 

First, I need to refer back to the schema to understand the MCQ options. For Gender, the options are A. Female and B. Male. So, a response of 'a' is Female, 'b' is Male. The Admission Type has options A. Elective, B. Emergency, C. Urgent. So, 'b' in Admission Type corresponds to Emergency.

Now, I'll go through each respondent's data and check these three conditions: Gender is Male (B), Admission Type is Emergency (B), and Billing Amount is less than 40,000.

Starting with Respondent 129: Gender is 'a' (Female), so that's out. Next, Respondent 144: Gender 'a' again, Female. Respondent 91: Gender 'a' (Female). Respondent 19: Gender 'a' (Female). 

Respondent 102: Gender is 'b' (Male). Admission Type is 'b' (Emergency). Billing Amount is 18,856, which is below 40k. So this one counts. 

Respondent 11: Gender 'b' (Male). Admission Type 'b' (Emergency). Billing Amount is 43, which is way below 40k. So this is another. 

Respondent 112: Gender 'a' (Female). Respondent 5: Gender 'a' (Female). 

Wait, are there any others? Let me check again. 

Respondent 102 and 11 are the only ones with Gender 'b' (Male). Both have Admission Type 'b' (Emergency). Their billing amounts are 18,856 and 43, both under 40k. So that's two respondents. 

Wait, but let me double-check all entries to be sure. 

Looking at Respondent 5: Gender 'a', so no. Respondent 19: Gender 'a'. Respondent 112: 'a'. The rest are either Female or have different Admission Types. 

So the total should be 2.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose length of stay is between 10 and 40 days and who were admitted for an 'Urgent' procedure.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents who stayed between 10 and 40 days and were admitted for an 'Urgent' procedure. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The questions section tells me that Admission Type is an MCQ with options A. Elective, B. Emergency, C. Urgent. So, if a respondent has Admission Type 'c', that maps to 'Urgent'. 

Next, I need to calculate the length of stay for each respondent. The dates are given in Date of Admission and Discharge Date. The format is YYYY-MM-DD. To find the length of stay, I'll subtract the admission date from the discharge date. 

But wait, I need to be careful with the date formats. Let me check each respondent's dates. For example, Respondent 20 was admitted on 2023-05-12 and discharged on 2023-08-11. Let's calculate that. May has 31 days, so from May 12 to May 31 is 19 days. Then June has 30, July 31, and August 11. So 19 + 30 +31 +11 = 91 days. That's way over 40, so they don't qualify.

Looking at Respondent 148: Admitted 2023-08-17, discharged 2023-10-12. Let's see: August 17 to August 31 is 14 days, September has 30, October 12. Total 14+30+12=56 days. Also over 40.

Respondent 110: Admitted 2019-12-12, discharged 2019-08-21. Wait, that's a problem. The discharge date is before the admission date. That might be a typo. Maybe the year is wrong? If it's 2019-12-12 to 2019-08-21, that's impossible. Maybe the discharge date should be 2020-08-21? But the data as given has discharge before admission, which can't be right. So perhaps this is an error, but I have to work with the data provided. In that case, the length of stay would be negative, which doesn't make sense. So maybe this respondent is excluded from consideration.

Respondent 6: Admitted 2022-09-19, discharged 2022-08-10. Again, discharge before admission. Another data error. So their stay is negative days. So they can't be counted.

Now, let's go through each respondent one by one.

Respondent 20: Admission Type 'a' is Elective. So not Urgent. Disregard.

Respondent 81: Admission Type 'b' is Emergency. Not Urgent. Disregard.

Respondent 148: Admission Type 'c' is Urgent. Let's check dates. Admitted 2023-08-17, discharged 2023-10-12. As calculated earlier, 56 days. Over 40. So no.

Respondent 110: Admission Type 'a' (Elective). Not Urgent. Disregard.

Respondent 147: Admission Type 'b' (Emergency). Not Urgent. Disregard.

Respondent 104: Admission Type 'a' (Elective). Disregard.

Respondent 107: Admission Type 'a' (Elective). Disregard.

Respondent 75: Admission Type 'c' (Urgent). Let's check dates. Admitted 2021-02-12, discharged 2021-01-26. Again, discharge date is before admission. Negative days. So invalid. Exclude.

Respondent 30: Admission Type 'b' (Emergency). Not Urgent. Disregard.

Respondent 6: Admission Type 'a' (Elective). Disregard.

Respondent 84: Admission Type 'c' (Urgent). Admitted 2020-01-27, discharged 2020-05-13. Let's calculate. January 27 to January 31: 4 days. February 29 (2020 is a leap year): 29. March 31, April 30, May 13. Total: 4 +29 +31 +30 +13 = 107 days. Over 40.

Respondent 44: Admission Type 'a' (Elective). Disregard.

Wait, so among all respondents, only two had Admission Type 'c' (Urgent): Respondent 75 and 84. But both had discharge dates before admission (75) or a long stay (84). So no one meets the criteria of 10-40 days and Urgent. But wait, maybe I missed someone.

Wait, let's check again. Are there any other respondents with Admission Type 'c'?

Looking back:

Respondent 148: Admission Type 'c' (Urgent). Stay was 56 days. Over 40. No.

Respondent 75: Admission Type 'c' (Urgent). Discharge date before admission. Invalid.

Respondent 84: Admission Type 'c' (Urgent). Stay 107 days. Over 40.

So none of the Urgent admissions have a valid length of stay between 10 and 40 days. Therefore, the count is zero.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again.

Wait, Respondent 75's dates: Admitted 2021-02-12, discharged 2021-01-26. That's impossible. So invalid. Disregard.

Respondent 84: Admitted 2020-01-27, discharged 2020-05-13. Let's compute again. From Jan 27 to May 13, 2020.

January: 27th to 31st: 4 days.

February: 29 days (leap year).

March: 31.

April: 30.

May: 13.

Total: 4 +29 +31 +30 +13 = 107 days. Correct. So over 40.

So no respondents meet both criteria. Therefore, the answer is 0.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the respondents who are in a hospital where the number of patients with Arthritis is greater than the number of patients with Asthma.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents who are in a hospital where the number of patients with Arthritis is greater than the number of patients with Asthma. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The data provided includes multiple respondents, each associated with a hospital. For each hospital, I need to determine how many patients have Arthritis (Medical Condition A) and how many have Asthma (Medical Condition B). Then, compare these counts for each hospital and identify which hospitals have more Arthritis cases than Asthma. Finally, count all respondents in those hospitals.

Let me start by listing all the hospitals and their corresponding patients' medical conditions. 

Looking at the responses:

- Respondent 93: Hospital HOSP_93, Medical Condition A (Arthritis)
- Respondent 23: HOSP_23, Medical Condition B (Asthma)
- Respondent 112: HOSP_112, Medical Condition C (Cancer)
- Respondent 28: HOSP_28, Medical Condition D (Diabetes)
- Respondent 63: HOSP_63, Medical Condition C (Cancer)
- Respondent 103: HOSP_103, Medical Condition F (Obesity)
- Respondent 135: HOSP_135, Medical Condition B (Asthma)
- Respondent 21: HOSP_21, Medical Condition A (Arthritis)
- Respondent 102: HOSP_102, Medical Condition E (Hypertension)
- Respondent 80: HOSP_80, Medical Condition C (Cancer)
- Respondent 87: HOSP_87, Medical Condition D (Diabetes)
- Respondent 57: HOSP_57, Medical Condition D (Diabetes)

Now, I need to group these by hospital and count Arthritis (A) and Asthma (B) cases.

Let's go through each hospital:

1. HOSP_93: 1 Arthritis (A), 0 Asthma (B)
2. HOSP_23: 0 A, 1 B
3. HOSP_112: 0 A, 0 B (Cancer)
4. HOSP_28: 0 A, 0 B (Diabetes)
5. HOSP_63: 0 A, 0 B (Cancer)
6. HOSP_103: 0 A, 0 B (Obesity)
7. HOSP_135: 0 A, 1 B
8. HOSP_21: 1 A, 0 B
9. HOSP_102: 0 A, 0 B (Hypertension)
10. HOSP_80: 0 A, 0 B (Cancer)
11. HOSP_87: 0 A, 0 B (Diabetes)
12. HOSP_57: 0 A, 0 B (Diabetes)

Now, for each hospital, check if Arthritis count > Asthma count:

- HOSP_93: 1 > 0 → Yes. All respondents here (Respondent 93) should be counted.
- HOSP_21: 1 > 0 → Yes. Respondent 21 is here.
- Other hospitals either have equal or lower counts for Arthritis.

So the hospitals meeting the condition are HOSP_93 and HOSP_21. 

Now, count the number of respondents in these hospitals. Each of these hospitals has only one respondent each. So total respondents = 1 (HOSP_93) + 1 (HOSP_21) = 2.

Wait, but let me double-check. Are there any other hospitals where Arthritis count exceeds Asthma? Let me recheck:

HOSP_93: 1 A, 0 B → yes
HOSP_21: 1 A, 0 B → yes
Others: HOSP_23 has 0 A, 1 B; HOSP_135 has 0 A, 1 B. The rest have 0 for both or other conditions. So only those two hospitals qualify.

Therefore, the total respondents in qualifying hospitals are 2.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents have a Billing Amount that is higher than the average Billing Amount for their Admission Type?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking how many respondents have a Billing Amount higher than the average Billing Amount for their respective Admission Type. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The Admission Type is an MCQ with options A. Elective, B. Emergency, C. Urgent. Each respondent has an Admission Type (a, b, or c) and a Billing Amount, which is an open-ended number.

The plan is to:

1. Calculate the average Billing Amount for each Admission Type (Elective, Emergency, Urgent).
2. For each respondent, compare their Billing Amount to the average of their Admission Type.
3. Count how many have a Billing Amount higher than their group's average.

Let's start by listing all respondents and their Admission Types and Billing Amounts.

Looking at the data:

Respondent 44: Admission Type a (Elective), Billing 48407
Respondent 20: Admission Type a (Elective), Billing -503
Respondent 131: Admission Type a (Elective), Billing 14238
Respondent 30: Admission Type b (Emergency), Billing 10301
Respondent 136: Admission Type c (Urgent), Billing 4398
Respondent 50: Admission Type a (Elective), Billing 5517
Respondent 90: Admission Type c (Urgent), Billing 25230
Respondent 38: Admission Type c (Urgent), Billing 8409
Respondent 61: Admission Type a (Elective), Billing 23500
Respondent 27: Admission Type b (Emergency), Billing 30591

Wait, let me check each one again to make sure I don't miss any:

- Respondent 44: Admission Type a (Elective), Billing 48407
- Respondent 20: Admission Type a (Elective), Billing -503
- Respondent 131: Admission Type a (Elective), Billing 14238
- Respondent 30: Admission Type b (Emergency), Billing 10301
- Respondent 136: Admission Type c (Urgent), Billing 4398
- Respondent 50: Admission Type a (Elective), Billing 5517
- Respondent 90: Admission Type c (Urgent), Billing 25230
- Respondent 38: Admission Type c (Urgent), Billing 8409
- Respondent 61: Admission Type a (Elective), Billing 23500
- Respondent 27: Admission Type b (Emergency), Billing 30591

So, group them by Admission Type:

Elective (a): Respondents 44, 20, 131, 50, 61. Their Billing Amounts: 48407, -503, 14238, 5517, 23500.

Emergency (b): Respondents 30, 27. Billing: 10301, 30591.

Urgent (c): Respondents 136, 90, 38. Billing: 4398, 25230, 8409.

Now, calculate the average for each group.

Starting with Elective (a):

Sum = 48407 + (-503) + 14238 + 5517 + 23500

Let's compute step by step:

48407 - 503 = 47904

47904 + 14238 = 62142

62142 + 5517 = 67659

67659 + 23500 = 91159

Average = 91159 / 5 = 18231.8

So, average for Elective is approximately 18231.8.

Next, Emergency (b):

Sum = 10301 + 30591 = 40892

Average = 40892 / 2 = 20446

Urgent (c):

Sum = 4398 + 25230 + 8409 = 4398 + 25230 = 29628; 29628 + 8409 = 38037

Average = 38037 / 3 = 12679

Now, compare each respondent's Billing Amount to their group's average.

Elective group (average ~18231.8):

- Respondent 44: 48407 > 18231.8 → Yes
- Respondent 20: -503 < 18231.8 → No
- Respondent 131: 14238 < 18231.8 → No
- Respondent 50: 5517 < 18231.8 → No
- Respondent 61: 23500 > 18231.8 → Yes

So, 2 in Elective.

Emergency group (average 20446):

- Respondent 30: 10301 < 20446 → No
- Respondent 27: 30591 > 20446 → Yes

So, 1 in Emergency.

Urgent group (average 12679):

- Respondent 136: 4398 < 12679 → No
- Respondent 90: 25230 > 12679 → Yes
- Respondent 38: 8409 < 12679 → No

So, 1 in Urgent.

Total respondents meeting the condition: 2 (Elective) + 1 (Emergency) + 1 (Urgent) = 4.

Wait, let me double-check each calculation to avoid mistakes.

Elective average: 48407 + (-503) = 47904; +14238=62142; +5517=67659; +23500=91159. 91159/5=18231.8. Correct.

Elective respondents:

44: 48407 > 18231.8 → Yes

20: -503 < → No

131: 14238 < → No

50: 5517 < → No

61: 23500 > → Yes. So 2.

Emergency average: 10301 + 30591 = 40892. 40892/2=20446. Correct.

30: 10301 < → No

27: 30591 > → Yes. So 1.

Urgent average: 4398 +25230=29628 +8409=38037. 38037/3=12679. Correct.

136: 4398 < → No

90: 25230 > → Yes

38: 8409 < → No. So 1.

Total 2+1+1=4. So the answer should be 4.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the respondents who are in a hospital where the number of patients with Asthma is greater than the number of patients with Arthritis.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents who are in a hospital where the number of patients with Asthma is greater than the number of patients with Arthritis. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The questions section tells me that 'Medical Condition' is an MCQ with options A. Arthritis, B. Asthma, etc. So, in the responses, when a respondent has Medical Condition 'a', that's Arthritis, and 'b' is Asthma.

Next, I need to look at each hospital and count how many patients have Asthma versus Arthritis. Then, for each hospital where Asthma cases exceed Arthritis cases, count all the respondents in that hospital.

Looking at the responses:

Let's list all the hospitals and their patients' medical conditions.

Respondent 66: Hospital HOSP_66, Medical Condition 'b' (Asthma)
Respondent 51: HOSP_51, Medical Condition 'b' (Asthma)
Respondent 45: HOSP_45, Medical Condition 'f' (Obesity)
Respondent 40: HOSP_40, Medical Condition 'b' (Asthma)
Respondent 20: HOSP_20, Medical Condition 'b' (Asthma)
Respondent 46: HOSP_46, Medical Condition 'a' (Arthritis)
Respondent 127: HOSP_127, Medical Condition 'b' (Asthma)

Now, group by hospitals:

HOSP_66: 1 Asthma
HOSP_51: 1 Asthma
HOSP_45: 1 Obesity
HOSP_40: 1 Asthma
HOSP_20: 1 Asthma
HOSP_46: 1 Arthritis
HOSP_127: 1 Asthma

Now, for each hospital, count Asthma (B) and Arthritis (A) cases:

HOSP_66: Asthma=1, Arthritis=0 → Asthma > Arthritis (yes)
HOSP_51: Asthma=1, Arthritis=0 → yes
HOSP_45: Neither, so Asthma=0, Arthritis=0 → no
HOSP_40: Asthma=1, Arthritis=0 → yes
HOSP_20: Asthma=1, Arthritis=0 → yes
HOSP_46: Arthritis=1, Asthma=0 → no
HOSP_127: Asthma=1, Arthritis=0 → yes

So the hospitals where Asthma > Arthritis are HOSP_66, HOSP_51, HOSP_40, HOSP_20, HOSP_127. 

Now, count the number of respondents in each of these hospitals. Each of these hospitals has only one respondent each. So total respondents in qualifying hospitals: 5 (from HOSP_66, 51,40,20,127). 

Wait, but let me check again. Each hospital listed here has only one respondent. So 5 hospitals each with 1 respondent. So total respondents is 5. 

But wait, are there any hospitals with multiple respondents? Let me check again. All the hospitals in the data are unique except maybe I missed a duplicate. Let's check:

HOSP_66: only Respondent 66
HOSP_51: only 51
HOSP_45: 45
HOSP_40: 40
HOSP_20: 20
HOSP_46:46
HOSP_127:127

No duplicates. So each hospital has one patient. So for each of the hospitals where Asthma count (1) is greater than Arthritis (0), there's one respondent. So total 5 respondents. 

Wait, but HOSP_45 has a patient with Obesity (f), so Asthma and Arthritis counts are both 0. So that's not counted. HOSP_46 has Arthritis (a), so Asthma 0, Arthritis 1. So not counted. The other hospitals (66,51,40,20,127) each have 1 Asthma and 0 Arthritis. So 5 hospitals, each contributing 1 respondent. So the answer is 5.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents have a Billing Amount that is higher than the average Billing Amount for their Admission Type?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking for the number of respondents whose Billing Amount is higher than the average Billing Amount for their respective Admission Type. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The Admission Type is an MCQ with options A. Elective, B. Emergency, C. Urgent. Each respondent has an Admission Type (a, b, or c) and a Billing Amount, which is an open-ended number.

So, the plan is:

1. **Calculate the average Billing Amount for each Admission Type.**
   - Group all respondents by their Admission Type.
   - For each group (Elective, Emergency, Urgent), compute the average of their Billing Amounts.

2. **Compare each respondent's Billing Amount to their group's average.**
   - For each respondent, check if their Billing Amount is higher than the average of their Admission Type group.

3. **Count how many respondents meet this condition.**

Let's start by extracting the necessary data from the responses. Let's list each respondent's Admission Type (mapped to the actual labels) and their Billing Amount.

Looking at the respondents one by one:

- **Respondent 145**: Admission Type 'c' → Urgent, Billing 46430
- **Respondent 149**: Admission Type 'b' → Emergency, Billing 33211
- **Respondent 115**: Admission Type 'c' → Urgent, Billing 40693
- **Respondent 83**: Admission Type 'c' → Urgent, Billing 25966
- **Respondent 81**: Admission Type 'b' → Emergency, Billing 14681
- **Respondent 39**: Admission Type 'c' → Urgent, Billing 45453
- **Respondent 113**: Admission Type 'a' → Elective, Billing 19328
- **Respondent 18**: Admission Type 'b' → Emergency, Billing 12263
- **Respondent 121**: Admission Type 'b' → Emergency, Billing 50119
- **Respondent 114**: Admission Type 'a' → Elective, Billing 20258
- **Respondent 78**: Admission Type 'c' → Urgent, Billing 23068
- **Respondent 71**: Admission Type 'a' → Elective, Billing 31486

Now, group them by Admission Type:

**Elective (a):**
- Respondent 113: 19328
- Respondent 114: 20258
- Respondent 71: 31486

**Emergency (b):**
- Respondent 149: 33211
- Respondent 81: 14681
- Respondent 18: 12263
- Respondent 121: 50119

**Urgent (c):**
- Respondent 145: 46430
- Respondent 115: 40693
- Respondent 83: 25966
- Respondent 39: 45453
- Respondent 78: 23068

Next, calculate the average for each group.

**Elective Average:**
Sum = 19328 + 20258 + 31486 = 71072
Count = 3
Average = 71072 / 3 ≈ 23690.67

**Emergency Average:**
Sum = 33211 + 14681 + 12263 + 50119 = 110,274
Count = 4
Average = 110274 / 4 = 27568.5

**Urgent Average:**
Sum = 46430 + 40693 + 25966 + 45453 + 23068 = 181,610
Count = 5
Average = 181610 / 5 = 36322

Now, compare each respondent's Billing Amount to their group's average.

**Elective Group:**
- 19328 vs 23690.67 → Below
- 20258 vs 23690.67 → Below
- 31486 vs 23690.67 → Above (31486 > 23690.67) → Count this

**Emergency Group:**
- 33211 vs 27568.5 → Above → Count
- 14681 vs 27568.5 → Below
- 12263 vs 27568.5 → Below
- 50119 vs 27568.5 → Above → Count

**Urgent Group:**
- 46430 vs 36322 → Above → Count
- 40693 vs 36322 → Above → Count
- 25966 vs 36322 → Below
- 45453 vs 36322 → Above → Count
- 23068 vs 36322 → Below

Now, tally up the counts:

Elective: 1 (Respondent 71)
Emergency: 2 (Respondents 149 and 121)
Urgent: 3 (Respondents 145, 115, 39)

Total = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
How many respondents have a Billing Amount that is higher than the average Billing Amount for their Admission Type?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking how many respondents have a Billing Amount higher than the average Billing Amount for their respective Admission Type. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The Admission Type is an MCQ with options A. Elective, B. Emergency, C. Urgent. Each respondent has an Admission Type (a, b, or c) and a Billing Amount, which is an open-ended number.

The plan is to:

1. Calculate the average Billing Amount for each Admission Type (Elective, Emergency, Urgent).
2. For each respondent, compare their Billing Amount to the average of their Admission Type.
3. Count how many have a Billing Amount higher than their group's average.

Let's start by extracting the Admission Type and Billing Amount for each respondent. 

Looking at the responses:

Respondent 91:
- Admission Type: a (Elective)
- Billing Amount: 26787

Respondent 130:
- Admission Type: a (Elective)
- Billing Amount: 34618

Respondent 19:
- Admission Type: b (Emergency)
- Billing Amount: 10352

Respondent 80:
- Admission Type: c (Urgent)
- Billing Amount: 43282

Respondent 119:
- Admission Type: a (Elective)
- Billing Amount: 6768

Now, group them by Admission Type:

Elective (a): 26787, 34618, 6768
Emergency (b): 10352
Urgent (c): 43282

Calculate the average for each group.

For Elective:
Sum = 26787 + 34618 + 6768 = 26787 + 34618 is 61405, plus 6768 is 68173. There are 3 respondents. Average = 68173 / 3 ≈ 22724.33

Emergency has only one respondent: 10352. Average is 10352.

Urgent: 43282. Average is 43282.

Now, compare each respondent's Billing Amount to their group's average.

Respondent 91 (Elective): 26787 vs 22724.33. 26787 is higher. So yes.
Respondent 130 (Elective): 34618 > 22724.33. Yes.
Respondent 19 (Emergency): 10352 equals average. So no.
Respondent 80 (Urgent): 43282 equals average. No.
Respondent 119 (Elective): 6768 < 22724.33. No.

So, the count is 2 (Respondents 91 and 130).

<task>
Count the respondents who are in a hospital where the number of patients with Obesity is greater than the number of patients with Arthritis.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents who are in a hospital where the number of patients with Obesity is greater than the number of patients with Arthritis. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The data has multiple respondents, each associated with a hospital. For each hospital, I need to count how many patients have Obesity (Medical Condition F) and how many have Arthritis (Medical Condition A). Then, compare these two numbers for each hospital. If a hospital has more Obesity cases than Arthritis, all respondents from that hospital should be counted.

Let me start by listing all the hospitals and their corresponding patients' medical conditions. 

Looking at the responses:

- Respondent 10: Hospital HOSP_10, Medical Condition B (Asthma)
- Respondent 15: HOSP_15, Condition A (Arthritis)
- Respondent 95: HOSP_95, E (Hypertension)
- Respondent 74: HOSP_74, A (Arthritis)
- Respondent 20: HOSP_20, B (Asthma)
- Respondent 24: HOSP_24, D (Diabetes)
- Respondent 130: HOSP_130, D (Diabetes)
- Respondent 99: HOSP_99, F (Obesity)
- Respondent 119: HOSP_119, F (Obesity)
- Respondent 149: HOSP_149, F (Obesity)
- Respondent 142: HOSP_142, B (Asthma)
- Respondent 11: HOSP_11, E (Hypertension)

Now, let's group by hospitals:

HOSP_10: 1 patient (Asthma)
HOSP_15: 1 (Arthritis)
HOSP_95: 1 (Hypertension)
HOSP_74: 1 (Arthritis)
HOSP_20: 1 (Asthma)
HOSP_24: 1 (Diabetes)
HOSP_130: 1 (Diabetes)
HOSP_99: 1 (Obesity)
HOSP_119: 1 (Obesity)
HOSP_149: 1 (Obesity)
HOSP_142: 1 (Asthma)
HOSP_11: 1 (Hypertension)

Wait, but each hospital here only has one respondent. So for each hospital, the count of Obesity and Arthritis would be either 0 or 1. 

Looking for hospitals where Obesity count > Arthritis count. 

Let's check each hospital:

- HOSP_99: 1 Obesity, 0 Arthritis → 1>0 → yes
- HOSP_119: 1 Obesity, 0 → yes
- HOSP_149: 1 Obesity, 0 → yes
Other hospitals either have 0 Obesity and 0 or 1 Arthritis, or have Arthritis but no Obesity. 

So the hospitals that meet the condition are HOSP_99, HOSP_119, HOSP_149. Each has 1 respondent. 

Total respondents in these hospitals: 1 (HOSP_99) + 1 (HOSP_119) + 1 (HOSP_149) = 3.

Wait, but let me double-check. Are there any hospitals with more than one respondent? From the data given, each hospital is listed once. So each hospital has only one patient in the dataset. Therefore, for each of these three hospitals, Obesity count is 1, Arthritis is 0. So they qualify. 

Therefore, the total number of respondents in such hospitals is 3.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents have a Billing Amount that is higher than the average Billing Amount for their Admission Type?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking how many respondents have a Billing Amount higher than the average Billing Amount for their respective Admission Type. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The Admission Type is an MCQ with options A. Elective, B. Emergency, C. Urgent. Each respondent has an Admission Type (a, b, or c) and a Billing Amount, which is an open-ended number.

The plan is to:

1. Calculate the average Billing Amount for each Admission Type (Elective, Emergency, Urgent).
2. For each respondent, compare their Billing Amount to the average of their Admission Type.
3. Count how many have a Billing Amount higher than their group's average.

Let's start by listing all respondents with their Admission Type and Billing Amount.

Looking at the data:

Respondent 147: Admission Type b (Emergency), Billing 25250
Respondent 49: Admission Type a (Elective), 25302
Respondent 83: Admission Type c (Urgent), 25966
Respondent 122: Admission Type b (Emergency), 48996
Respondent 129: Admission Type a (Elective), 30358
Respondent 39: Admission Type c (Urgent), 45453
Respondent 16: Admission Type c (Urgent), 36992
Respondent 116: Admission Type c (Urgent), 40015
Respondent 27: Admission Type b (Emergency), 30591
Respondent 88: Admission Type a (Elective), 39616
Respondent 22: Admission Type c (Urgent), 5998
Respondent 130: Admission Type a (Elective), 34618

Now, group them by Admission Type:

Elective (a):
- Respondent 49: 25302
- Respondent 129: 30358
- Respondent 88: 39616
- Respondent 130: 34618

Total 4 respondents. Let's calculate the average for Elective.

Sum: 25302 + 30358 + 39616 + 34618 = 25302+30358=55660; 55660+39616=95276; 95276+34618=129,894. Average is 129894 /4 = 32,473.5

Emergency (b):
- Respondent 147: 25250
- Respondent 122: 48996
- Respondent 27: 30591

Sum: 25250 +48996 = 74,246 +30,591 = 104,837. Average: 104837 /3 ≈ 34,945.67

Urgent (c):
- Respondent 83: 25966
- Respondent 39: 45453
- Respondent 16: 36992
- Respondent 116: 40015
- Respondent 22: 5998

Sum: 25966 +45453 = 71,419 +36,992 = 108,411 +40,015 = 148,426 +5998 = 154,424. Average: 154,424 /5 = 30,884.8

Now, compare each respondent's Billing Amount to their group's average.

Elective group (avg 32,473.5):
- 49: 25,302 → below
- 129: 30,358 → below
- 88: 39,616 → above
- 130: 34,618 → above (34,618 > 32,473.5)

So 2 in Elective.

Emergency group (avg ~34,945.67):
- 147: 25,250 → below
- 122: 48,996 → above
- 27: 30,591 → below

So 1 in Emergency.

Urgent group (avg 30,884.8):
- 83: 25,966 → below
- 39: 45,453 → above
- 16: 36,992 → above (36,992 >30,884.8)
- 116: 40,015 → above
- 22: 5,998 → below

So 3 in Urgent.

Total respondents meeting the criteria: 2 +1 +3 =6.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who are in a hospital where the number of patients with Cancer is greater than the number of patients with Diabetes.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents who are in a hospital where the number of patients with Cancer is greater than the number of patients with Diabetes. 

First, I need to understand the data provided. The responses include several hospitals, each with patients having different medical conditions. My goal is to determine for each hospital how many patients have Cancer (Medical Condition C) and how many have Diabetes (Medical Condition D). Then, compare those numbers and count the hospitals where Cancer cases exceed Diabetes cases. Finally, count all respondents in those hospitals.

Let me start by listing all the hospitals and their patients' medical conditions. 

Looking at the responses:

- Respondent 11: Hospital HOSP_11, Medical Condition E (Hypertension)
- Respondent 64: Hospital HOSP_64, Medical Condition D (Diabetes)
- Respondent 113: Hospital HOSP_113, Medical Condition E (Hypertension)
- Respondent 135: Hospital HOSP_135, Medical Condition B (Asthma)
- Respondent 134: Hospital HOSP_134, Medical Condition F (Obesity)
- Respondent 41: Hospital HOSP_41, Medical Condition F (Obesity)
- Respondent 94: Hospital HOSP_94, Medical Condition C (Cancer)

Wait, so each respondent is in a different hospital. Let me check each hospital's patients:

HOSP_11 has 1 patient (Respondent 11) with Hypertension (E). No Cancer or Diabetes here.

HOSP_64 has 1 patient (Respondent 64) with Diabetes (D). So Diabetes count is 1, Cancer is 0.

HOSP_113 has 1 patient (Respondent 113) with Hypertension (E). No Cancer or Diabetes.

HOSP_135 has 1 patient (Respondent 135) with Asthma (B). No Cancer or Diabetes.

HOSP_134 has 1 patient (Respondent 134) with Obesity (F). No Cancer or Diabetes.

HOSP_41 has 1 patient (Respondent 41) with Obesity (F). No Cancer or Diabetes.

HOSP_94 has 1 patient (Respondent 94) with Cancer (C). So Cancer count is 1, Diabetes is 0.

Now, for each hospital, compare Cancer and Diabetes counts:

- HOSP_11: Cancer 0 vs Diabetes 0 → Not applicable.
- HOSP_64: Cancer 0 vs Diabetes 1 → Diabetes higher.
- HOSP_113: Both 0 → Not applicable.
- HOSP_135: Both 0 → Not applicable.
- HOSP_134: Both 0 → Not applicable.
- HOSP_41: Both 0 → Not applicable.
- HOSP_94: Cancer 1 vs Diabetes 0 → Cancer higher.

So the only hospital where Cancer patients outnumber Diabetes is HOSP_94. This hospital has 1 respondent (Respondent 94). 

Therefore, the count of respondents in such hospitals is 1.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents over the age of 60 have a length of stay that is longer than the average for their specific Admission Type?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking for the number of respondents over 60 years old who stayed longer than the average length of stay for their specific admission type. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The questions section tells me that Age is an open-ended question, so the values are numerical. Admission Type is a MCQ with options A. Elective, B. Emergency, C. Urgent. The Date of Admission and Discharge Date are open-ended, so I can calculate the length of stay by subtracting the admission date from the discharge date.

So, the plan is:

1. Calculate the length of stay (LOS) for each respondent.
2. For each admission type (Elective, Emergency, Urgent), compute the average LOS.
3. For each respondent over 60, check if their LOS is greater than the average LOS of their admission type.
4. Count how many such respondents exist.

Let's start by processing each respondent. Let's list all respondents and their details:

Looking at the responses:

Respondent 73: Age 21 (not over 60)
Respondent 100: 42 (no)
Respondent 105: 54 (no)
Respondent 87: 55 (no)
Respondent 14: 85 (yes)
Respondent 86: 80 (yes)
Respondent 17: 19 (no)
Respondent 85: 67 (yes)
Respondent 25: 63 (yes)
Respondent 143: 80 (yes)

Wait, let's check each age:

- Respondent 73: 21 → no
- 100: 42 → no
- 105:54 → no
- 87:55 → no
- 14:85 → yes
- 86:80 → yes
- 17:19 → no
- 85:67 → yes
- 25:63 → yes
- 143:80 → yes

So, respondents over 60 are: 14 (85), 86 (80), 85 (67), 25 (63), 143 (80). Wait, 63 is over 60, yes. So that's 5 respondents.

Wait, 63 is over 60, yes. So total 5 respondents over 60.

Now, for each of these, we need to calculate their LOS and compare it to the average LOS of their admission type.

First, let's compute LOS for all respondents, not just those over 60, because we need the average per admission type.

Calculating LOS for each respondent:

For each, subtract admission date from discharge date. The dates are in YYYY-MM-DD format. Let's parse each date and compute the difference in days.

Let's list all respondents with their dates:

Respondent 73:
Admission: 2024-01-05
Discharge: 2024-03-26
LOS: From Jan 5 to March 26, 2024.

2024 is a leap year. January has 31 days. So from Jan 5 to Jan 31: 26 days (31-5=26, but including the start day, so 26 days? Wait, 5th to 5th is 1 day. So 5th to 31st is 31-5=26 days. Then February has 29 days (leap year), March 26 days. So total: 26 (Jan) + 29 (Feb) + 26 (March) = 81 days? Wait, no. Wait, from Jan 5 to March 26:

Days in Jan: 31 - 5 +1 = 27 days (since 5th is day 1)
Feb: 29 days (leap year)
March: 26 days
Total: 27 +29 +26 = 82 days.

Wait, let me check:

From Jan 5 to Jan 31: 31-5=26 days, but since the 5th is included, it's 27 days (including both start and end dates? Wait, no. If admitted on Jan 5 and discharged on Jan 5, LOS is 1 day. So from Jan 5 to March 26:

Calculate using date difference:

March 26 minus Jan 5:

2024-01-05 to 2024-03-26.

Using a date calculator:

January: 31 days. From 5th to 31st: 27 days (including 5th)
February: 29 days
March: 26 days
Total: 27 +29 +26 = 82 days.

Respondent 73: LOS 82 days.

Respondent 100:
Admission: 2023-08-13
Discharge: 2023-08-25
August 13 to August 25: 25-13=12 days, but including both days: 13th to 25th is 13 days (25-13+1=13)
LOS: 13 days.

Respondent 105:
Admission: 2023-05-18
Discharge: 2023-06-03
From May 18 to June 3: May has 31 days. 31-18=13 days in May (18th to 31st is 14 days including both), then 3 days in June. Total 14 +3 =17 days.

Wait, May 18 to May 31: 14 days (including 18th and 31st). Then June 1-3: 3 days. Total 14+3=17 days.

Respondent 105: LOS 17 days.

Respondent 87:
Admission: 2023-04-09
Discharge: 2023-01-27. Wait, this is a problem. Admission date is April 9, 2023, discharge is January 27, 2023. That's impossible. The discharge date is before the admission date. This must be a typo. But according to the data provided, it's written as:

Date of Admission: 2023-04-09
Discharge Date: 2023-01-27

So discharge is before admission. That's an error. How to handle this? Maybe it's a typo. Perhaps the discharge date is 2024-01-27? Or maybe the admission date is 2022-04-09? But the data is as given. Since we have to work with the data provided, perhaps this is a data entry error, but for the purpose of this problem, we have to proceed. However, this would result in a negative LOS. But since LOS can't be negative, perhaps we should treat this as 0 or consider it invalid. But the question doesn't mention handling data errors, so maybe we have to proceed as is. Let's note this and proceed, but this might affect the average.

Calculating LOS for Respondent 87:

Admission: 2023-04-09
Discharge: 2023-01-27
The discharge is 72 days before admission (since from Jan 27 to April 9 is 72 days). So LOS is negative. But since this is impossible, perhaps we should exclude this from the calculation. But the problem doesn't specify handling such cases. Alternatively, maybe the dates are swapped. For example, maybe the admission was 2023-01-09 and discharge 2023-04-27. But we can't assume that. Since the data is given as is, perhaps we have to proceed, but this would result in a negative LOS. However, in reality, this would be an error, but for the sake of the problem, perhaps we should treat it as a positive value? Or maybe the discharge date is a typo. For example, maybe the discharge date is 2023-04-27. But without more info, we have to take the data as given. Let's proceed, but this will affect the average for admission type 'a' (Elective), which is the admission type for Respondent 87.

But this is a problem. Let's see. Respondent 87's Admission Type is 'a' (Elective). If their LOS is negative, that would skew the average. But since the question is about respondents over 60, and Respondent 87 is 55, which is not over 60, maybe it's not an issue for the final count. But when calculating the average LOS for Elective admissions, we have to include all respondents with Admission Type 'a', including Respondent 87. But their LOS is negative, which is impossible. So perhaps this is a data entry error, but since we can't verify, we have to proceed with the given data. Alternatively, maybe the discharge date is a typo, but we can't assume that. Let's proceed with the given dates, but note that this might affect the average.

But since Respondent 87 is not in the over-60 group, maybe it's okay. Let's proceed.

Next, Respondent 14:

Age 85, over 60.

Admission: 2023-10-03
Discharge: 2023-09-11. Again, discharge before admission. Another data inconsistency. Admission date is October 3, discharge September 11. So LOS is negative. Again, this is a problem. But Respondent 14 is over 60, so this will affect the calculation. But again, we have to proceed with the data as given. So LOS is negative here as well.

Respondent 86:

Age 80, over 60.

Admission: 2021-12-19
Discharge: 2021-10-14. Again, discharge before admission. Negative LOS. Another data error. This is a problem. So their LOS is negative.

Respondent 17: Age 19, not over 60. Admission 2021-07-03, discharge 2021-08-12. That's a positive LOS. Let's calculate:

July 3 to August 12. July has 31 days. From July 3 to July 31: 29 days (31-3=28, plus 1 day inclusive: 29 days). Then August 1-12: 12 days. Total 29+12=41 days.

Respondent 17: LOS 41 days.

Respondent 85: Age 67, over 60.

Admission: 2022-10-29
Discharge: 2022-11-20. October 29 to November 20. October has 31 days. From Oct 29 to Oct 31: 3 days (29,30,31). November 1-20: 20 days. Total 3+20=23 days.

Respondent 85: LOS 23 days.

Respondent 25: Age 63, over 60.

Admission: 2023-11-05
Discharge: 2023-11-07. That's 2 days (5th to 7th is 2 days inclusive? Wait, 5th to 5th is 1 day, 5th to 6th is 2 days, 5th to 7th is 3 days. So 7-5=2, but including both dates: 3 days. So LOS is 3 days.

Respondent 25: LOS 3 days.

Respondent 143: Age 80, over 60.

Admission: 2022-12-10
Discharge: 2022-09-27. Again, discharge before admission. Negative LOS. Data error.

So, summarizing the LOS for all respondents:

Respondent 73: 82 days (Admission Type a: Elective)
Respondent 100: 13 days (Admission Type c: Urgent)
Respondent 105:17 days (Admission Type a: Elective)
Respondent 87: Negative (Admission Type a: Elective)
Respondent 14: Negative (Admission Type a: Elective)
Respondent 86: Negative (Admission Type a: Elective)
Respondent 17:41 days (Admission Type a: Elective)
Respondent 85:23 days (Admission Type b: Emergency)
Respondent 25:3 days (Admission Type a: Elective)
Respondent 143: Negative (Admission Type b: Emergency)

Wait, let's check Admission Types:

Respondent 73: Admission Type a → Elective
Respondent 100: Admission Type c → Urgent
Respondent 105: Admission Type a → Elective
Respondent 87: Admission Type a → Elective
Respondent 14: Admission Type a → Elective
Respondent 86: Admission Type a → Elective
Respondent 17: Admission Type a → Elective
Respondent 85: Admission Type b → Emergency
Respondent 25: Admission Type a → Elective
Respondent 143: Admission Type b → Emergency

So, for each admission type:

Elective (a): Respondents 73, 105, 87,14,86,17,25. But 87,14,86 have negative LOS. So their LOS is negative. How to handle that? Since LOS can't be negative, perhaps these are data errors and should be excluded. But the problem statement doesn't mention handling data quality, so we have to proceed as is. However, including negative LOS would skew the average. For example, for Elective admissions, the LOS would be:

73:82, 105:17, 87: negative (say -72 days?), 14: negative (say -22 days?), 86: negative (say -66 days?), 17:41, 25:3.

Calculating the average for Elective:

Sum of LOS: 82 +17 + (-72) + (-22) + (-66) +41 +3.

Let's compute:

82 +17 =99

99 -72=27

27-22=5

5-66= -61

-61 +41= -20

-20 +3= -17

Total sum: -17

Number of Elective admissions:7

Average LOS for Elective: -17/7 ≈ -2.43 days. That's impossible. So clearly, the data has errors. But since we have to work with the given data, perhaps we should treat the negative LOS as positive? Or maybe the dates are swapped. For example, in Respondent 87, maybe the admission date is 2023-01-09 and discharge 2023-04-27. But we can't assume that. Alternatively, perhaps the discharge date is a typo. For example, Respondent 14's discharge date is 2023-09-11, which is before admission date 2023-10-03. Maybe it's supposed to be 2023-11-09? But again, we can't know. 

Given that the problem doesn't mention handling data errors, perhaps we have to proceed with the data as given, even if it leads to negative LOS. But this would make the average LOS for Elective negative, which is impossible. Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is to treat the LOS as the absolute value, assuming that the dates were entered in reverse. For example, if discharge is before admission, LOS is the number of days from discharge to admission. But that's an assumption. However, the problem statement doesn't specify this, so it's unclear. 

Alternatively, maybe the LOS is calculated as the maximum of (discharge date - admission date) and 0. But again, this is an assumption. Since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps we should proceed with the data as is, even if it results in negative numbers. 

But this is a critical issue because the average LOS for a type could be negative, and comparing a respondent's LOS (which might be negative) to that average would be problematic. 

Given that the problem is from a survey, perhaps the dates were entered incorrectly, but we have to proceed. Let's proceed with the data as given, even if it results in negative LOS. 

So, proceeding:

For each admission type, calculate the average LOS, including negative values.

Elective (a) respondents: 73,105,87,14,86,17,25.

Their LOS:

73:82

105:17

87: (2023-04-09 to 2023-01-27) → let's compute the exact days. 

From 2023-01-27 to 2023-04-09:

January 27 to January 31: 4 days (27,28,29,30,31 → 5 days? Wait, 27th to 31st is 5 days. Then February: 28 days (2023 is not a leap year), March:31 days, April 9 days. Total:5 +28 +31 +9=73 days. But since discharge is before admission, LOS is -73 days.

Similarly, Respondent 14: Admission 2023-10-03, discharge 2023-09-11. From Sept 11 to Oct 3: 22 days (Sept 11-30: 20 days, Oct 1-3:3 days → 23 days). So LOS is -23 days.

Respondent 86: Admission 2021-12-19, discharge 2021-10-14. From Oct 14 to Dec 19: 

Oct 14-31: 18 days

November:30

December 1-19:19 days

Total:18+30+19=67 days. LOS is -67 days.

Respondent 17:41 days.

Respondent 25:3 days.

So sum for Elective:

82 (73) +17 (105) + (-73) (87) + (-23) (14) + (-67) (86) +41 (17) +3 (25) 

Calculate step by step:

Start with 82 +17 =99

99 -73 =26

26 -23=3

3 -67= -64

-64 +41= -23

-23 +3= -20

Total sum: -20

Number of Elective respondents:7

Average LOS for Elective: -20/7 ≈ -2.857 days.

Emergency (b) respondents: 85,143.

Respondent 85: Admission 2022-10-29, discharge 2022-11-20. LOS 23 days.

Respondent 143: Admission 2022-12-10, discharge 2022-09-27. Discharge is before admission. Compute LOS:

From Sept 27 to Dec 10:

Sept 27-30:4 days

October:31

November:30

December 1-10:10

Total:4+31+30+10=75 days. So LOS is -75 days.

Sum for Emergency:23 + (-75) = -52

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who are in a hospital where the number of patients with Cancer is greater than the number of patients with Asthma.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents who are in a hospital where the number of patients with Cancer is greater than the number of patients with Asthma. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The data provided includes multiple respondents, each associated with a hospital. Each respondent has a Medical Condition, which is an MCQ with options including Cancer (C) and Asthma (B). The hospitals are listed under the 'Hospital' field, which is open-ended, so each entry is like HOSP_73, HOSP_65, etc.

My approach should be:

1. **Group respondents by their Hospital.** For each hospital, I need to count how many patients have Cancer and how many have Asthma.
2. **Compare the counts for each hospital.** For hospitals where Cancer count > Asthma count, note those hospitals.
3. **Count all respondents in those hospitals.** Once I have the qualifying hospitals, count all respondents in them, regardless of their medical condition.

Let me start by going through each respondent and mapping their Hospital to their Medical Condition.

Looking at the responses:

- **Respondent 73**: Hospital HOSP_73, Medical Condition D (Diabetes)
- **Respondent 65**: HOSP_65, Medical Condition E (Hypertension)
- **Respondent 39**: HOSP_39, D (Diabetes)
- **Respondent 86**: HOSP_86, E (Hypertension)
- **Respondent 21**: HOSP_21, A (Arthritis)
- **Respondent 150**: HOSP_150, B (Asthma)
- **Respondent 37**: HOSP_37, D (Diabetes)
- **Respondent 90**: HOSP_90, B (Asthma)
- **Respondent 80**: HOSP_80, C (Cancer)
- **Respondent 101**: HOSP_101, E (Hypertension)
- **Respondent 34**: HOSP_34, E (Hypertension)

Wait, let me check each one again to make sure I didn't miss any Cancer or Asthma cases.

Looking at Medical Conditions:

- Cancer is option C. Let's check each respondent's Medical Condition code:

- Respondent 73: D → Diabetes
- 65: E → Hypertension
- 39: D → Diabetes
- 86: E → Hypertension
- 21: A → Arthritis
- 150: B → Asthma
- 37: D → Diabetes
- 90: B → Asthma
- 80: C → Cancer
- 101: E → Hypertension
- 34: E → Hypertension

So, the only Cancer case is Respondent 80 in HOSP_80. The Asthma cases are Respondents 150 (HOSP_150) and 90 (HOSP_90).

Now, group by Hospital:

- HOSP_73: 0 Cancer, 0 Asthma
- HOSP_65: 0, 0
- HOSP_39: 0,0
- HOSP_86:0,0
- HOSP_21:0,0
- HOSP_150:0 Asthma (Respondent 150 has Asthma)
- HOSP_37:0,0
- HOSP_90:0 Asthma (Respondent 90 has Asthma)
- HOSP_80:1 Cancer, 0 Asthma
- HOSP_101:0,0
- HOSP_34:0,0

Wait, let me correct that. For each hospital, count Cancer and Asthma:

HOSP_80 has 1 Cancer (Respondent 80). No Asthma patients here.

HOSP_150 has 1 Asthma (Respondent 150). No Cancer here.

HOSP_90 has 1 Asthma (Respondent 90). No Cancer here.

Other hospitals have neither Cancer nor Asthma.

So, for each hospital:

- HOSP_80: Cancer=1, Asthma=0 → 1>0 → qualifies.
- HOSP_150: Cancer=0, Asthma=1 → doesn't qualify.
- HOSP_90: Cancer=0, Asthma=1 → doesn't qualify.

Only HOSP_80 has more Cancer than Asthma patients (1 vs 0). 

Now, count all respondents in HOSP_80. Looking back:

Only Respondent 80 is in HOSP_80. So the total count is 1.

Therefore, the answer should be 1.
