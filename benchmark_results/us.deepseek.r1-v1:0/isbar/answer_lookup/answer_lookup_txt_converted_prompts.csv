</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Identification of the respondent from the 'III-Sepsis' session on '2025-03-14'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the Identification score for the respondent who attended the 'III-Sepsis' session on '2025-03-14'. 

First, I need to look through the responses section and filter out the entries that match both the SessionName and the Date. The SessionName is 'III-Sepsis' and the Date is '2025-03-14'. 

Looking at the list of respondents:

- Respondent 19: SessionName is 'I - MI' on 2025-05-16. Doesn't match.
- Respondent 14: SessionName is 'IV-Hypoglycemia' on 2025-03-14. Date matches, but session name doesn't.
- Respondent 2: SessionName 'MI' on 2025-04-04. Doesn't match.
- Respondent 1: SessionName 'V (Hypoglycemia)' on 2025-05-02. Nope.
- Respondent 3: SessionName 'III-Sepsis' but the date is 2025-04-04. Date doesn't match.
- Respondent 7: SessionName is 'III-Sepsis' and the date is 2025-03-14. That's a match.

Now, checking Respondent 7's data. The Identification field here is 3. According to the questions schema, Identification is scored on a rubric from 0 to 3. The value 3 corresponds to ""Introduces themselves and information is complete"". 

So the answer should be the text description for a score of 3 in the Identification rubric. The output should be exactly that text, not the number 3. The user's output rules specify to provide the human-readable value, not the code. Therefore, the correct answer is ""Introduces themselves and information is complete"".

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Background (history) of respondent '14'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question. The task is to find the Background (history) of respondent 14.

First, I need to look at the provided data. The user has given a dataset with multiple respondents. Each respondent has various fields like Date, SessionName, Identification, Situation, etc. The question specifically asks for the Background (history) of respondent 14.

Looking at the Questions section, question 5 is about Background (history) with a rubric. The possible scores are 0 to 3, each corresponding to different levels of performance. But the output rules say to provide the human-readable value based on the rubric. Wait, no—the output rules mention that for MCQ fields, we map the code to the option text. However, in this case, the Background (history) is a rubric-based score, not an MCQ with options A, B, C, etc. The rubric is a scale from 0 to 3 with descriptions. But according to the output rules, if it's a rubric with numerical scores, do we output the numerical value or the description?

Wait, the output rules state: ""For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses... to the corresponding option text..."". But here, the responses for Background (history) are numerical (e.g., 3, 2, etc.), and the rubric is a numerical scale. The question is not an MCQ with letter options but a rubric with numerical scores. So in this case, the answer is the numerical value provided in the response. The user's instruction says, ""If the question asks for a count, provide only the number..."". But this isn't a count. However, the output rules also say, ""For open-ended fields, output the exact text value."" But Background (history) isn't an open-ended field; it's a rubric-scored question. 

Wait, looking back at the Questions section, question 5 is ""Background (history): Gives appropriate history. [Rubric: 0 = ... 3 = ...]"". The responses for each respondent under Background (history) are numbers like 3, 2, etc. The task is to report the value for respondent 14. 

The output rules mention that for MCQ fields (which this might be considered as, with the rubric options), but the responses are numerical. However, the example given in the output rules shows that if the schema is an MCQ with letters (A, B, C) and the response is a letter, you output the corresponding text. But in this case, the rubric is numerical, and the responses are numbers. The user's example in the initial part shows that the answer was ""2"" for the Assessment of a certain session. So in that case, the answer was the numerical value. 

Therefore, for this question, the answer is the numerical value provided in respondent 14's Background (history) field. Looking at the data for respondent 14:

Respondent 14:
  Date: 2025-03-14
  SessionName: IV-Hypoglycemia
  Identification: 3
  Situation: 3
  Background (history): 2
  Background (examination): 2
  Assessment: 3
  Recommendation (clear recommendation): 1
  Recommendation (global rating scale): 2
  Comments: Time: (2:36-2:53)
Late response for considering consultation

So the Background (history) is 2. According to the rubric for question 5, a score of 2 means ""Relevant history with few further questions needed"". But the output rules say to output the human-readable value. Wait, the output rules state that for MCQ fields, map the code to the option text. But here, the rubric is a scale with numerical codes. However, the user's example in the initial part had a question asking for the Assessment, and the answer was ""2"", which is the numerical value. So perhaps in this case, the answer is the numerical value, not the text description. 

But the output rules say: ""For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both."" However, the Background (history) is not an MCQ with letter options. It's a rubric with numerical scores. Therefore, the answer is the numerical value provided in the response. 

But wait, the user's example in the initial part had a question about the Assessment, which was answered with ""2"", which is the numerical value. So following that example, the answer here should be ""2"". However, the user's output rules also mention that if the question is an MCQ, map the code to the text. But in this case, the rubric is a numerical scale, not an MCQ with letters. Therefore, the answer is the numerical value. 

But let me check the original data again. The question is: ""What is the Background (history) of respondent '14'?"" The data for respondent 14 shows ""Background (history): 2"". Therefore, the answer is 2. However, according to the output rules, if the question is an MCQ, we need to map the code to the text. But the rubric here is a numerical scale, not an MCQ with letters. Therefore, the answer is the numerical value. 

But wait, the rubric for Background (history) is a scale from 0 to 3 with descriptions. The output rules say that for MCQ fields (which this might be considered as, even though it's numerical), but the example in the initial part shows that the answer was the numerical value. For instance, the example question was about the Assessment, and the answer was ""2"". The Assessment's rubric is similar to the Background (history) rubric. Therefore, the answer here is the numerical value, which is 2. 

But the user's output rules also state: ""If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., '42')."" This isn't a count, but the answer is a numerical value. So the answer is 2.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the Background (history) of the respondent from the 'I - MI' session on '2025-05-16'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the Background (history) of the respondent from the 'I - MI' session on '2025-05-16'. 

First, I need to look through the provided data to identify the correct respondent. The key here is matching both the date and the session name exactly. 

Looking at the responses section, I'll start scanning each respondent's entry. 

Respondent 19 has the date 2025-05-16 and SessionName: I - MI. That matches the date and session name specified in the task. 

Now, under Respondent 19's data, the Background (history) is listed as 3. According to the questions schema, question 5 (Background (history)) has a rubric where 3 means ""Comprehensive focused history"".

I need to make sure there are no other respondents with the same date and session name. Scanning through the rest, Respondent 5 has a session on 2025-05-04, others have different dates or session names. So Respondent 19 is the correct one.

Therefore, the answer should be the text corresponding to the rubric score 3 for Background (history), which is ""Comprehensive focused history"".

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Situation of respondent '11'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the Situation of respondent 11 based on the provided data.

First, I need to locate respondent 11 in the responses section. Scanning through the list, I see ""Respondent 11"" with their data. The key here is the 'Situation' field. 

Looking at the questions schema, the Situation question is defined as: ""Identifies the main problem(s). [Rubric: 0 = Unable to identify the main problem(s), 1 = Identifies the main problem(s) after extended prompting, 2 = Identifies the main problem(s) with fewer prompts needed, 3 = Identifies and prioritizes the main problem(s) unprompted]"".

Now, checking respondent 11's entry, the Situation is rated as 3. According to the rubric, a score of 3 means they identified and prioritized the main problem(s) without needing prompts. 

I need to ensure there's no confusion with other respondents or fields. The answer should be the text corresponding to the rubric value 3 for Situation. The output should be the exact wording from the schema: ""Identifies and prioritizes the main problem(s) unprompted"".

So, the Background (examination) here is listed as 1. Now, according to the questions section, the rubric for Background (examination) is:

6. Background (examination): Gives appropriate examination/observations. [Rubric: 0 = Observations are omitted or irrelevant, 1 = Observations reported but frequent clarification needed, 2 = Observations reported with few further questions needed, 3 = Comprehensive focused examination/observations]

The value here is 1, which corresponds to ""Observations reported but frequent clarification needed"". The output should be the text from the rubric, not the numerical code. So the answer is ""Observations reported but frequent clarification needed"".

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Assessment of respondent '23'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question. The task is to find the Assessment of respondent 23. First, I need to look at the data provided.

Looking at the Survey Data, under the Responses section, I need to find Respondent 23. Let me scan through each respondent. Here's Respondent 12, then Respondent 23. 

For Respondent 23, the entries are:
- Date: 2025-03-14
- SessionName: II-Anaphylaxsis
- Identification: 3
- Situation: 3
- Background (history): 2
- Background (examination): 2
- Assessment: 3
- Recommendation (clear recommendation): 3
- Recommendation (global rating scale): 3
- Comments: Time: (11:43-11:58) ... etc.

The question is asking for the Assessment. According to the Questions schema, question 7 is Assessment, which uses a rubric. The rubric states:
0 = No logical assessment
1 = Assessment only after extended questioning
2 = Assessment after minimal questioning
3 = Comprehensive logical assessment without questioning

Respondent 23's Assessment is 3. So according to the rubric, a score of 3 corresponds to ""Comprehensive logical assessment without questioning"". 

I need to make sure there's no confusion with other respondents. The answer should be the text from the rubric, not the number. So the answer is ""Comprehensive logical assessment without questioning"".

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Recommendation (global rating scale) of the respondent from the 'MI' session on '2025-04-04'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the Recommendation (global rating scale) for the respondent from the 'MI' session on '2025-04-04'. 

First, I need to look through the responses provided. Let's start by filtering the respondents based on the date and session name. The date in question is 2025-04-04, and the session name is 'MI'. 

Looking at the list of respondents:

- Respondent 15: Date 2025-05-04, Session III - Sepsis. Not the right date or session.
- Respondent 13: Date 2025-03-14, Session I-VF. Wrong date.
- Respondent 9: Date 2025-05-04, Session II (Anaphylaxsis). Wrong date and session.
- Respondent 18: Date 2025-05-04, Session IV - VT. Wrong date.
- Respondent 8: Date 2025-05-02, Session III (Sepsis). Wrong date.
- Respondent 11: Date 2025-04-04, Session IV (AF). Correct date but wrong session.
- Respondent 2: Date 2025-04-04, Session MI. This matches both the date and session name.

Now, looking at Respondent 2's data, the field we need is ""Recommendation (global rating scale)"". According to the questions section, this is question 9, which uses the rubric: 0 = Not at all confident, 1 = Confident but required extended questioning, 2 = Confident but required some further questioning, 3 = Confident and required little or no questioning.

In Respondent 2's response, the value for ""Recommendation (global rating scale)"" is 1. According to the rubric, 1 corresponds to ""Confident but required extended questioning"".

So the answer should be the text associated with the value 1 in the global rating scale, which is ""Confident but required extended questioning"".

What is the Recommendation (global rating scale) of respondent '9'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question. The task is to find the Recommendation (global rating scale) for respondent 9.

First, I need to look at the data provided. Let me start by locating respondent 9 in the responses section. Scrolling through the list, here's Respondent 9:

Respondent 9:
  Date: 2025-05-04
  SessionName: II (Anaphylaxsis)
  Identification: 3
  Situation: 3
  Background (history): 2
  Background (examination): 2
  Assessment: 2
  Recommendation (clear recommendation): 3
  Recommendation (global rating scale): 2
  Comments: Overall a bit unclear communication reflected

So, under ""Recommendation (global rating scale)"", the value is 2. 

Now, checking the questions section to understand what the rubric for this question is. The 9th question is the Global Rating Scale (GRS) with the rubric:
0 = Not at all confident, 1 = Confident but required extended questioning, 2 = Confident but required some further questioning, 3 = Confident and required little or no questioning.

Respondent 9 has a score of 2 here. According to the rubric, 2 corresponds to ""Confident but required some further questioning"". 

The output rules specify that for MCQ fields, we should map the code to the corresponding text from the schema. Since the response is 2, the correct answer is the text associated with 2 in the GRS rubric. 

Therefore, the answer should be ""Confident but required some further questioning"".

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Background (examination) of the respondent from the 'II - Anaphylaxsis' session on '2025-05-04'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the Background (examination) score for the respondent who attended the 'II - Anaphylaxsis' session on '2025-05-04'. 

First, I need to look through the responses to find the entry that matches both the date and the session name. Let's start by scanning the list of respondents.

Looking at Respondent 5: Their date is 2025-05-04, and the SessionName is 'II - Anaphylaxsis'. That matches both the date and the session name specified. The Background (examination) here is listed as 3. 

Wait, let me double-check if there are any other respondents with the same date and session. Respondent 9 has the same date, 2025-05-04, and their SessionName is 'II (Anaphylaxsis)'. The session names are slightly different in formatting (hyphen vs. parentheses), but the content is the same. However, the task specifies 'II - Anaphylaxsis', which matches Respondent 5's entry exactly. 

But wait, the user might consider variations in the session name formatting. Let me check the rubric for Background (examination). The possible scores are 0 to 3. For Respondent 5, the Background (examination) is 3, which according to the rubric means ""Comprehensive focused examination/observations"". 

No other respondents on 2025-05-04 have the session name exactly as 'II - Anaphylaxsis' except Respondent 5. Respondent 9's session is written as 'II (Anaphylaxsis)', which might be a typo or different formatting, but the question specifies 'II - Anaphylaxsis', so Respondent 5 is the correct one. 

Therefore, the answer should be the rubric value corresponding to 3, which is ""Comprehensive focused examination/observations"".

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Assessment of the respondent from the 'IV (AF)' session on '2025-04-04'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the Assessment score for the respondent who attended the 'IV (AF)' session on '2025-04-04'. 

First, I need to look through the responses section to find the respondent with the matching Date and SessionName. The date given is 2025-04-04, and the session name is 'IV (AF)'. 

Looking at the list of respondents:

- Respondent 11 has Date 2025-04-04 and SessionName IV (AF). That's the one we need. 

Now, checking their Assessment score. The Assessment is question 7 in the schema. The rubric for Assessment is a scale from 0 to 3. The response for Respondent 11 under Assessment is 3. 

According to the questions schema, a score of 3 in Assessment means ""Comprehensive logical assessment without questioning"". 

So the answer should be the text corresponding to the score 3 for the Assessment question. The output should be the human-readable value, not the number. Therefore, the answer is ""Comprehensive logical assessment without questioning"".

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the Assessment of the respondent from the 'I (Myocardial infarction)' session on '2025-05-16'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the Assessment score for the respondent who attended the 'I (Myocardial infarction)' session on '2025-05-16'. 

First, I need to look through the responses to find the entry that matches both the date and the session name. The date given is 2025-05-16, and the session name is 'I (Myocardial infarction)'. 

Looking at the list of respondents, I'll go through each one. 

Starting with Respondent 20: Their date is 2025-05-02 and session IV (VT). Not a match.

Respondent 3: Date 2025-04-04, session III-Sepsis. Nope.

Respondent 13: 2025-03-14, I-VF. Not the right date or session.

Respondent 21: Here we go. Date is 2025-05-16, SessionName: I (Myocardial infarction). That's exactly the one we're looking for. 

Now, checking the Assessment field for Respondent 21. The value listed is 2. 

According to the questions schema, the Assessment rubric is:
0 = No logical assessment
1 = Assessment only after extended questioning
2 = Assessment after minimal questioning
3 = Comprehensive logical assessment without questioning

So a score of 2 corresponds to ""Assessment after minimal questioning"". 

I need to make sure there's no other respondent with the same date and session. Scanning through the rest: Respondent 15, 17, 9, 1, 11, 12, 2. None of these have the date 2025-05-16. 

Therefore, the correct answer is the Assessment value for Respondent 21, which is 2, translating to ""Assessment after minimal questioning"".

What is the Identification of respondent '15'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question. The task is to find the Identification score for respondent 15.

First, I need to look at the data provided. The user has given a list of respondents with their respective data. Each respondent has an Identification field with a numerical value based on the rubric.

Looking at the Questions section, the Identification question has a rubric where 3 means the respondent introduced themselves and the information is complete. The possible scores are 0 to 3.

Now, I need to go through the Responses section and find Respondent 15. Let me scan through each respondent entry. 

Here's Respondent 15's data:
- Date: 2025-05-04
- SessionName: III - Sepsis
- Identification: 3
- Situation: 3
- Background (history): 2
- Background (examination): 3
- Assessment: 2
- Recommendation (clear recommendation): 2
- Recommendation (global rating scale): 2
- Comments: Detailed Response - clear communication

So, the Identification value here is 3. According to the rubric, a score of 3 corresponds to ""Introduces themselves and information is complete."" 

I need to make sure there's no other respondent 15 or any possible confusion. Checking all other respondents, the numbers go up to 21, but each has a unique number. Respondent 15 is correctly listed once with Identification 3. 

The output should be the text corresponding to the score 3, which is ""Introduces themselves and information is complete."" No need to include the number, just the text as per the rubric.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Background (history) of the respondent from the '(MI)-VT' session on '2025-03-14'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the Background (history) score for the respondent who attended the '(MI)-VT' session on '2025-03-14'. 

First, I need to look through the responses to find the correct respondent. Let's start by checking each respondent's data.

Looking at the list of respondents:

- Respondent 17: Date is 2025-05-04, SessionName V (Hypoglycemia). Not the right date or session.
- Respondent 6: Date 2025-04-04, SessionName II (Anaphylactic Shock). Date doesn't match.
- Respondent 23: 2025-03-14, SessionName II-Anaphylaxsis. Date matches, but session name is different.
- Respondent 4: 2025-05-16, Session III (Sepsis). Nope.
- Respondent 10: Date 2025-03-14, SessionName (MI)-VT. This matches both the date and session name specified in the question. 
- The rest are other dates or sessions.

So, Respondent 10 is the one we need. Now, looking at their Background (history) score. The question asks for the value, which according to the schema is a rubric score. The possible values are 0 to 3. 

In Respondent 10's data, Background (history) is listed as 2. According to the rubric for question 5: 0 = unstructured/non-relevant, 1 = relevant but needs frequent clarification, 2 = relevant with few further questions needed, 3 = comprehensive focused history. 

So the answer should be the rubric description corresponding to 2. But the output rules say to provide the human-readable value. Wait, the output instructions state for MCQ fields to map codes to the option text. However, in this case, the rubric is a scale, not an MCQ with letters. The question is asking for the value, which is a numerical score mapped to a description. But the output rules specify that for MCQ fields, output the text. However, the Background (history) is a rubric with numerical scores, not letter options. The user's output rules mention that for MCQ fields (with letters A, B, C), map to the text. But here, the responses use numbers. So perhaps in this case, the answer is the numerical value, but according to the output rules, if it's an MCQ with letters, we map to text. But since the rubric uses numbers, maybe we just output the number. Wait, the user's example in the <example> shows that the answer was ""2"" for the Assessment. So in that case, the answer is the numerical value. But looking at the schema, the rubric is a scale with numerical scores. So the answer is the number, not the text. Wait, but the output rules say for MCQ fields, map letters to text. But here, the responses are numbers. So perhaps the answer is the number. Let me check the example again. In the example, the question was about the Assessment, and the answer was ""2"", which is the numerical score. So in that case, the answer is the number. Therefore, here, the answer is 2. But the user's output rules say to output the human-readable value, not the code. Wait, but the rubric's options are numerical. So maybe the answer is the number. Let me confirm. The question is asking for the Background (history) of the respondent. The data for Respondent 10 shows Background (history): 2. According to the schema, that's ""Relevant history with few further questions needed"". But the output rules state that for MCQ fields, map any letter codes to the corresponding option text. However, in this case, the options are numerical. The example given in the <example> had the answer as ""2"", which is the numerical value. Therefore, the answer here is 2. But wait, the output rules say to output the human-readable value. Wait, the rubric's options are descriptions, but the response is a number. So perhaps the answer is the number. But the example in the <example> had the answer as ""2"", which is the numerical value. So following that, the answer here is 2. However, the user might expect the text description. But according to the output rules, for MCQ fields, output the text. But the rubric here uses numbers as codes. Let me check the schema again. The questions are structured with a rubric that has numerical scores (0-3) and descriptions. The responses use numbers. The output rules say for MCQ fields (with letters), map to text. But here, the options are numbers. So perhaps in this case, the answer is the numerical value. The example given in the <example> had the answer as ""2"", which is the numerical value. Therefore, the answer here is 2. But wait, the user's output rules state: ""For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both."" But in this case, the responses are numbers, not letters. So perhaps the answer is the number. Therefore, the answer is 2.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Situation of the respondent from the 'IV (VT)' session on '2025-05-02'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the Situation score for the respondent who attended the 'IV (VT)' session on '2025-05-02'. 

First, I need to look through the responses to find the correct respondent. The key data points here are the Date and SessionName. The date we're looking for is 2025-05-02, and the SessionName should be 'IV (VT)'. 

Looking at the list of respondents:

- Respondent 18: Date is 2025-05-04, SessionName IV - VT. The date doesn't match, so skip.
- Respondent 17: Date 2025-05-04, different session. Not relevant.
- Respondent 1: Date 2025-05-02, but SessionName is V (Hypoglycemia). Not the right session.
- Respondent 20: Date 2025-05-02, SessionName IV (VT). This matches both the date and the session name. 
- The other respondents have different dates or session names, so they can be ignored.

Now, focusing on Respondent 20, the Situation field is listed as 3. According to the questions schema, the Situation question's rubric is:
0 = Unable to identify the main problem(s)
1 = Identifies after extended prompting
2 = Identifies with fewer prompts
3 = Identifies and prioritizes unprompted.

Since the score is 3, the corresponding answer is ""Identifies and prioritizes the main problem(s) unprompted"". 

I need to make sure there's no other respondent with the same date and session. Checking again, Respondent 20 is the only one. The answer should be the text corresponding to the score 3 for Situation.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Identification of respondent '18'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the Identification score for Respondent 18.

First, I need to look at the provided data. The questions section defines each field, including Identification, which uses a rubric from 0 to 3. The responses section lists each respondent's data. 

Looking at Respondent 18's entry, under the Identification field, the value is 3. According to the rubric for Identification, a score of 3 means ""Introduces themselves and information is complete."" 

I need to make sure I'm referencing the correct respondent and the correct field. The question specifically asks for Respondent 18's Identification, so I don't need to check others. The answer should be the text corresponding to the score 3 as per the rubric, not the numerical value. 

So the answer should be ""Introduces themselves and information is complete.""

What is the Recommendation (global rating scale) of the respondent from the 'IV (VT)' session on '2025-05-02'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the Recommendation (global rating scale) for the respondent from the 'IV (VT)' session on '2025-05-02'. 

First, I need to look through the responses to find the correct respondent. The date given is 2025-05-02, and the session name is 'IV (VT)'. Let me check each respondent's data.

Looking at Respondent 20: Their date is 2025-05-02, and the SessionName is listed as ""IV (VT)"". That matches the criteria. Now, checking their 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' value, it's 3. 

According to the questions schema, the rubric for the global rating scale (Question 9) is:
0 = Not at all confident
1 = Confident but required extended questioning
2 = Confident but required some further questioning
3 = Confident and required little or no questioning

So a score of 3 corresponds to ""Confident and required little or no questioning"". The answer should be the text from the rubric, not the number. Therefore, the correct output is ""Confident and required little or no questioning"".

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Background (history) of respondent '8'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question. The task is to find the Background (history) of respondent 8.

First, I need to look at the data provided. The user has given a structured dataset with questions and responses. The questions section defines each field, including the rubric for scoring. The responses are from different respondents, each with their own data entries.

Looking at the question: ""What is the Background (history) of respondent '8'?"" So, I need to locate respondent 8 in the responses and check their Background (history) score. Then, map that score to the corresponding rubric description from the questions section.

In the questions, the Background (history) has a rubric:
0 = History is unstructured or non-relevant
1 = Relevant history but frequent clarification needed
2 = Relevant history with few further questions needed
3 = Comprehensive focused history

Now, checking the responses for respondent 8. Scrolling through the list, here's respondent 8's entry:

Respondent 8:
  Date: 2025-05-02
  SessionName: III (Sepsis)
  Identification: 3
  Situation: 3
  Background (history): 3
  Background (examination): 2
  Assessment: 2
  Recommendation (clear recommendation): 2
  Recommendation (global rating scale): 3
  Comments: Clear communication during handover
Good

So, the Background (history) score here is 3. According to the rubric, a score of 3 corresponds to ""Comprehensive focused history"". 

Therefore, the answer should be ""Comprehensive focused history"". I need to make sure there's no confusion with other respondents or fields. Let me double-check that I'm looking at the correct respondent and the correct field. Yes, respondent 8's Background (history) is indeed 3. The rubric for 3 is correct. No other possible interpretations here. The answer is straightforward.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Recommendation (clear recommendation) of respondent '5'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question. The task is to find the Recommendation (clear recommendation) for respondent 5.

First, I need to look at the data provided. The user has given a list of respondents with their respective data. Each respondent has various fields like Date, SessionName, Identification, Situation, etc. The question specifically asks about the ""Recommendation (clear recommendation)"" for respondent 5.

Looking at the Responses section, I need to locate respondent 5. Let me scan through each respondent entry. 

Here's the list of respondents: 3, 17, 8, 9, 16, 7, 5, 19, 4, 13. Oh, there's Respondent 5 listed. Let me check their details.

Under Respondent 5:
- Date: 2025-05-04
- SessionName: II - Anaphylaxsis
- Identification: 3
- Situation: 3
- Background (history): 3
- Background (examination): 3
- Assessment: 3
- Recommendation (clear recommendation): 2
- Recommendation (global rating scale): 3
- Comments: Good clear and precise clinical handover Good

So, the ""Recommendation (clear recommendation)"" for respondent 5 is 2. Now, according to the Questions schema, the rubric for this field is:

8. Recommendation (clear recommendation): Makes a clear recommendation. [Rubric: 0 = No recommendation, 1 = Clear recommendation only after extended questioning, 2 = Clear recommendation after minimal questioning, 3 = Clear comprehensive recommendation without questioning]

The value 2 corresponds to ""Clear recommendation after minimal questioning"". Therefore, the answer should be this exact phrase as per the output rules, which require using the text from the schema and not the code.

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the Background (examination) of the respondent from the 'IV (AF)' session on '2025-04-04'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the Background (examination) score for the respondent in the 'IV (AF)' session on '2025-04-04'. 

First, I need to look through the responses provided. Let me go through each respondent one by one.

Starting with Respondent 2: Their date is 2025-04-04, SessionName is MI. That's not the session we're looking for. Moving on.

Respondent 13: Date is 2025-03-14, SessionName I-VF. Not the right date or session.

Respondent 11: Date is 2025-04-04, which matches. SessionName is IV (AF). That's exactly the session in question. Let's check their Background (examination) score. The data shows ""Background (examination): 3"". 

According to the questions schema, the rubric for Background (examination) is:
0 = Observations omitted or irrelevant
1 = Observations reported but frequent clarification needed
2 = Observations reported with few further questions needed
3 = Comprehensive focused examination/observations

Since the score is 3, the corresponding value is ""Comprehensive focused examination/observations"". 

I should verify if there are any other respondents with the same date and session. Checking the rest: Respondent 4, 8, 7 have different dates or session names. So Respondent 11 is the correct one. The answer should be the rubric text for score 3.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Assessment of the respondent with the highest Recommendation (global rating scale) in the 'IV-Hypoglycemia' session?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the Assessment of the respondent with the highest Recommendation (global rating scale) in the 'IV-Hypoglycemia' session. 

First, I need to look through all the respondents and filter those who have the SessionName 'IV-Hypoglycemia'. From the data provided, I see that Respondent 14 has SessionName: IV-Hypoglycemia. The date for this session is 2025-03-14.

Next, I need to check the 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' for this respondent. According to the data, Respondent 14's global rating scale is 2. Now, I need to confirm if there are any other respondents in the same session. Looking through the list, the other respondents have different SessionNames like IV - VT, III - Sepsis, II - Anaphylaxsis, etc. So, Respondent 14 is the only one in IV-Hypoglycemia.

Since there's only one respondent in that session, their global rating scale of 2 is the highest (and only) in that category. Now, the question asks for the Assessment of this respondent. Checking Respondent 14's data, the Assessment score is 3. 

But wait, the rubric for the Assessment question (Question 7) says that a score of 3 means ""Comprehensive logical assessment without questioning"". So, the answer should be the text corresponding to the score 3 for Assessment. According to the output rules, I need to map the numerical value to the rubric description. Therefore, the Assessment is ""Comprehensive logical assessment without questioning"".

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Background (history) of the respondent whose total score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and 'Assessment' was exactly 4?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the Background (history) score of the respondent whose total score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and 'Assessment' adds up exactly to 4. 

First, I need to understand the structure of the data provided. The questions section defines each field, including the rubric for scoring. The responses are from various respondents with their scores for each category.

Looking at the questions, 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and 'Assessment' are both scored on a rubric from 0 to 3. The task is to find a respondent where the sum of these two scores equals 4. 

So, I need to go through each respondent's data and check their scores for these two fields. Let's list out each respondent and their relevant scores:

- **Respondent 8**: 
  - Recommendation (clear recommendation): 2
  - Assessment: 2
  - Sum: 2 + 2 = 4

- **Respondent 6**:
  - Recommendation: 2
  - Assessment: 2
  - Sum: 2 + 2 = 4

- **Respondent 14**:
  - Recommendation: 1
  - Assessment: 3
  - Sum: 1 + 3 = 4

- **Respondent 16**:
  - Recommendation: 2
  - Assessment: 3
  - Sum: 2 + 3 = 5

- **Respondent 20**:
  - Recommendation: 2
  - Assessment: 3
  - Sum: 5

- **Respondent 7**:
  - Recommendation: 2
  - Assessment: 2
  - Sum: 4

So, the respondents with a total of 4 are Respondents 8, 6, 14, and 7. Now, for each of these, we need to look at their Background (history) score.

- **Respondent 8**: Background (history) = 3
- **Respondent 6**: Background (history) = 3
- **Respondent 14**: Background (history) = 2
- **Respondent 7**: Background (history) = 2

The question asks for the Background (history) of the respondent(s) meeting the total score of 4. However, there are multiple respondents here. Wait, but the question says ""the respondent"", implying a single answer. Let me check if there's a mistake here.

Wait, the question says ""the respondent"", but there are multiple respondents with a sum of 4. However, perhaps I made an error in calculation. Let me double-check each:

- Respondent 8: 2 (Recommendation) + 2 (Assessment) = 4 ✅
- Respondent 6: 2 + 2 = 4 ✅
- Respondent 14: 1 + 3 = 4 ✅
- Respondent 7: 2 + 2 = 4 ✅

So four respondents meet the criteria. But the answer expects a single value. However, the question might have a unique answer. Let me check the data again.

Wait, looking at the data, perhaps there's a typo or a miscalculation. Let me recheck:

Respondent 14's Recommendation (clear recommendation) is 1, and Assessment is 3. 1+3=4. Correct.

Respondent 7: 2+2=4. Correct.

So there are four respondents. But the answer needs to be the Background (history) for each of them. However, the question might be looking for all such respondents. But the output rules state that if it's a list, provide a comma-separated list. However, the question is phrased as ""the respondent"", which is singular. Hmm, perhaps there's a mistake in the data or the question. Alternatively, maybe I missed a detail.

Wait, the question says ""the respondent whose total score..."". If there are multiple, perhaps the answer expects all their Background (history) scores. But the example given in the problem (the one with Answer: 2) shows that when multiple respondents meet the criteria, perhaps the answer is the one with the correct session and date. Wait, no, the example was about a specific session and date. In this case, the current task is different. The current task is to find the Background (history) of any respondent where the sum of Recommendation (clear recommendation) and Assessment is exactly 4. So if there are multiple, the answer would be all their Background (history) scores. But the output rules say for a list, provide a comma-separated list. However, the example answer was a single number. Let me check the output rules again.

The output rules state: If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list. Here, the question is asking for the Background (history) value(s) of the respondent(s) meeting the condition. Since there are multiple respondents, the answer would be the Background (history) scores of each, separated by commas. But the output must be the human-readable value, not the code. However, the Background (history) is a rubric score (0-3), so the answer would be the numerical values. Wait, the rubric for Background (history) is a numerical score (0-3), so the answer is the number. So if multiple respondents meet the condition, their Background (history) scores are listed.

Looking at the respondents:

- Respondent 8: 3
- Respondent 6: 3
- Respondent 14: 2
- Respondent 7: 2

So the answer would be 3,3,2,2. But the output rules say to provide a simple comma-separated list if it's a list. However, the question is phrased as ""the respondent"", which is singular. This might be a mistake in the question, but according to the data, there are four respondents. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I misread the data. Let me check each respondent again:

Respondent 8: Assessment 2, Recommendation 2 → 4. Background (history) 3.

Respondent 6: Assessment 2, Recommendation 2 → 4. Background (history) 3.

Respondent 14: Assessment 3, Recommendation 1 → 4. Background (history) 2.

Respondent 7: Assessment 2, Recommendation 2 → 4. Background (history) 2.

So four respondents. Therefore, the answer should be 3,3,2,2. But the output rules say to provide the answer directly and concisely. However, the example given in the problem had a single answer (2), but that was for a specific session and date. Here, the question is different. The user might have intended a single answer, but according to the data, there are multiple. However, perhaps there's a mistake in the data entry. Let me check the data again.

Wait, looking at the data for Respondent 6: SessionName is ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"", which is similar to the example's session ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"". But the current task isn't filtering by session or date. The current task is to find any respondent where the sum of the two scores is 4, regardless of session. So unless there's a respondent with a unique sum, but in this case, there are four. Therefore, the answer should list all their Background (history) scores. However, the output instructions say to provide the human-readable value. Since Background (history) is a rubric score (0-3), the answer would be the numbers. But the output rules state to output the exact text value for open-ended fields. However, Background (history) is a rubric-based numerical score, not an open-ended field. The open-ended fields are Date, SessionName, and Comments. The other fields are rubric-based with numerical scores. Therefore, the answer should be the numerical values of Background (history) for each qualifying respondent. 

But the question is phrased as ""the respondent"", which is singular. This could be a mistake in the question, or perhaps there's only one respondent with that total. Wait, let me check again. 

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated. Let me recheck each respondent's sum:

- Respondent 8: 2 (Assessment) + 2 (Recommendation) = 4. Correct.
- Respondent 6: 2 + 2 = 4. Correct.
- Respondent 14: 3 + 1 = 4. Correct.
- Respondent 7: 2 + 2 = 4. Correct.

So four respondents. Therefore, the answer should be the Background (history) scores for all four: 3,3,2,2. But the output format says to provide a simple comma-separated list if it's a list. However, the example answer in the problem was a single number (2), but that was for a different question. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is looking for the Background (history) of the respondent (singular) where the sum is exactly 4, but there are multiple. In that case, the answer would be all of them. However, the user might have intended a single answer, but the data shows multiple. 

Given that, the correct answer based on the data is that there are four respondents, and their Background (history) scores are 3,3,2,2. Therefore, the answer should be ""3,3,2,2"". But I need to check the output rules again. The output rules state: ""If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., '17, 21, 23')"". Here, the question is asking for the Background (history) value, which is a numerical score. If there are multiple respondents, the answer would be all their scores. However, the example in the problem had a single answer. 

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the question. Let me re-read the task: ""What is the Background (history) of the respondent whose total score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and 'Assessment' was exactly 4?"" The use of ""the respondent"" suggests a singular answer, but the data shows multiple. This could be a trick question where only one respondent meets the criteria, but according to the data, there are four. 

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check each respondent again:

Respondent 8: Assessment 2 + Recommendation 2 = 4. Correct.

Respondent 6: Same as above.

Respondent 14: Assessment 3 + Recommendation 1 = 4. Correct.

Respondent 7: Assessment 2 + Recommendation 2 =4. Correct.

So four respondents. Therefore, the answer is their Background (history) scores: 3,3,2,2. But the output format requires a human-readable value, and if it's a list, comma-separated. So the answer should be ""3, 3, 2, 2"". However, the example answer in the problem was a single number, but that was for a different question. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question has a typo, and the intended total is 5, but that's speculation. Given the data as is, the correct answer is the Background (history) scores of all respondents where the sum is 4. Therefore, the answer is 3,3,2,2.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

That matches the criteria. Their Identification score is 3. But I should check the others to make sure there aren't more respondents that fit.

Next, Respondent 7: Situation is 3, but Assessment is 2. Doesn't match. Respondent 10 has Situation 2 and Assessment 2. Nope. Respondent 22: Situation 3, Assessment 2. Not matching. Respondent 2: Situation 3, Assessment 3. Identification here is 3. So that's another one. Wait, the question says ""the respondent"", implying singular. Wait, are there multiple?

Continuing: Respondent 18: Situation 3, Assessment 3. Identification is 3. So that's a third. Respondent 19: Situation 3, Assessment 2. No. Respondent 11: Situation 3, Assessment 3. Identification 3. So that's another. Wait, how many are there?

Wait, let me list them all properly:

- Respondent 5: Situation 3, Assessment 3 → Identification 3
- Respondent 2: Situation 3, Assessment 3 → Identification 3
- Respondent 18: Situation 3, Assessment 3 → Identification 3
- Respondent 11: Situation 3, Assessment 3 → Identification 3

Wait, that's four respondents. But the question is asking for ""the respondent"", which might be a mistake if there are multiple. Let me check again.

Looking back at the data:

Respondent 5: Yes, both 3s. Identification 3.

Respondent 2: Situation 3, Assessment 3. Identification 3.

Respondent 18: Situation 3, Assessment 3. Identification 3.

Respondent 11: Situation 3, Assessment 3. Identification 3.

So four respondents meet the criteria. But the question is phrased as ""the respondent"", which is singular. However, the data shows multiple. Maybe the question has a typo, or perhaps I made a mistake. Let me verify each entry again.

Looking at each:

Respondent 5: Correct.

Respondent 2: Date 2025-04-04, SessionName MI. Situation 3, Assessment 3. Yes.

Respondent 18: Date 2025-05-04, Session IV - VT. Situation 3, Assessment 3. Yes.

Respondent 11: Date 2025-04-04, Session IV (AF). Situation 3, Assessment 3. Yes.

So four respondents. But the answer format expects a single value. Wait, maybe the question is intended to have multiple answers, but the output rules say for a list, provide a comma-separated list. The task says ""the respondent"" but maybe it's a mistake and should be plural. However, the example given in the problem had a single answer (Answer: 2). But in that example, there was only one respondent with the specified session and date. Here, the task is different. Let me check the task again.

The task is: ""What is the Identification of the respondent whose score for 'Situation' was 3 and score for 'Assessment' was 3?""

So, if there are multiple respondents with Situation 3 and Assessment 3, the answer would be a list of their Identification scores. But according to the output rules, if the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a comma-separated list. However, the Identification is a score (3 in all cases here). So the answer would be ""3"" for each, but the respondents are multiple. Wait, but the question is asking for the Identification of the respondent(s) that meet the criteria. So if there are multiple, the answer would be ""3"" for each, but since all have Identification 3, the answer is 3. Wait, but that's not possible. Let me check again.

Wait, all four respondents (5, 2, 18, 11) have Identification 3. So regardless of which one, the Identification is 3. But the question is phrased as ""the respondent"", but there are multiple. However, the answer is the Identification score, which is 3 for all of them. So the answer is 3. Because even though there are multiple respondents, each of their Identification scores is 3. Therefore, the answer is 3.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Identification of the respondent whose total score for 'Assessment' and 'Background (history)' was exactly 5?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the Identification of the respondent whose total score for 'Assessment' and 'Background (history)' equals exactly 5. 

First, I need to understand the structure of the data provided. The data includes multiple respondents, each with various scores across different categories. The key here is to look at two specific fields: 'Assessment' and 'Background (history)'. 

For each respondent, I need to add the score from 'Assessment' and 'Background (history)' and check if their sum is 5. Then, once I find the respondent(s) that meet this condition, I need to report their Identification score.

Looking at the questions section, the 'Assessment' and 'Background (history)' are both rubric-based scores. The possible values for each are 0 to 3. So the maximum sum possible would be 6 (3+3), and the minimum 0 (0+0). We're looking for a sum of 5.

Now, let's go through each respondent one by one:

Starting with Respondent 17:
- Background (history): 3
- Assessment: 3
Sum: 3 + 3 = 6 → Not 5.

Respondent 6:
- Background (history): 3
- Assessment: 2
Sum: 3 + 2 = 5 → This matches. Their Identification is 3. But let's check others to ensure there's no other respondent.

Respondent 2:
- Background (history): 2
- Assessment: 3
Sum: 2 + 3 = 5 → Also matches. Identification is 3.

Wait, so both Respondent 6 and 2 have a sum of 5. But the question asks for the Identification of the respondent(s) with this total. However, looking at the data again:

Wait, let me double-check. 

Respondent 6's Background (history) is 3, Assessment is 2. 3+2=5. Identification is 3.

Respondent 2's Background (history) is 2, Assessment is 3. 2+3=5. Identification is 3.

So both have a sum of 5. But the question is asking for the Identification of the respondent(s) with that total. However, the answer might be expecting a single respondent. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check all respondents again to confirm.

Continuing:

Respondent 23:
- Background (history): 2
- Assessment: 3 → 2+3=5. Identification is 3. So that's another one. Wait, three respondents now?

Wait, no. Let's check all:

Respondent 23:
Background (history): 2
Assessment: 3 → 5. Identification: 3.

Respondent 3:
Background (history): 3
Assessment: 3 → 6. No.

Respondent 22:
Background (history): 3
Assessment: 2 → 5. Identification: 3. So that's another one.

Wait, this can't be right. Let me list all respondents:

1. Respondent 17: 3+3=6
2. Respondent 6: 3+2=5 → ID 3
3. Respondent 2: 2+3=5 → ID 3
4. Respondent 23: 2+3=5 → ID 3
5. Respondent 3: 3+3=6
6. Respondent 22: 3+2=5 → ID 3
7. Respondent 19: 3+2=5 → ID 3
8. Respondent 20: 2+3=5 → ID 3
9. Respondent 11: 3+3=6
10. Respondent 14: 2+3=5 → ID 3
11. Respondent 4: 3+2=5 → ID 3
12. Respondent 7: 2+2=4 → No.

Wait, this can't be. Let me check each again carefully.

Wait, the 'Background (history)' and 'Assessment' scores:

Respondent 6:
Background (history): 3
Assessment: 2 → 5. ID 3.

Respondent 2:
Background (history): 2
Assessment: 3 → 5. ID 3.

Respondent 23:
Background (history): 2
Assessment: 3 → 5. ID 3.

Respondent 22:
Background (history): 3
Assessment: 2 → 5. ID 3.

Respondent 19:
Background (history): 3
Assessment: 2 → 5. ID 3.

Respondent 20:
Background (history): 2
Assessment: 3 → 5. ID 3.

Respondent 14:
Background (history): 2
Assessment: 3 → 5. ID 3.

Respondent 4:
Background (history): 3
Assessment: 2 → 5. ID 3.

Wait, that's a lot of respondents with sum 5. But according to the data provided, let's check each:

Looking back at the data:

Respondent 6:
- Background (history): 3
- Assessment: 2 → 5.

Respondent 2:
- Background (history): 2
- Assessment: 3 → 5.

Respondent 23:
- Background (history): 2
- Assessment: 3 → 5.

Respondent 22:
- Background (history): 3
- Assessment: 2 → 5.

Respondent 19:
- Background (history): 3
- Assessment: 2 → 5.

Respondent 20:
- Background (history): 2
- Assessment: 3 → 5.

Respondent 14:
- Background (history): 2
- Assessment: 3 → 5.

Respondent 4:
- Background (history): 3
- Assessment: 2 → 5.

So that's 8 respondents with sum 5. But all of them have Identification: 3. Wait, but the question is asking for the Identification of the respondent(s) whose total is exactly 5. Since all these respondents have Identification 3, the answer would be 3. But the answer format requires the human-readable value, which in the Identification rubric is ""Introduces themselves and information is complete"". But according to the schema, the Identification rubric is:

3 = Introduces themselves and information is complete.

So the answer is 3. But wait, the question is asking for the Identification value, which is the score (3), not the text. Wait, no. Wait, the output rules say:

""For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.""

But in this case, the Identification is a rubric with numerical codes. The responses have numbers (e.g., 3). The question is asking for the Identification, which is a rubric-based score. The output rules say to output the human-readable value. So for the Identification field, the rubric is:

3 = Introduces themselves and information is complete.

So if a respondent has Identification: 3, the answer should be ""Introduces themselves and information is complete"".

But the task is: ""What is the Identification of the respondent whose total score for 'Assessment' and 'Background (history)' was exactly 5?""

So the answer is the Identification value (the text) of the respondent(s) where Assessment + Background (history) =5. 

But according to the data, multiple respondents have this sum, and all of them have Identification:3. So the answer is ""Introduces themselves and information is complete"".

But wait, let me check if any of the respondents with sum 5 have a different Identification score. Let's go through each:

Respondent 6: ID 3.

Respondent 2: ID 3.

Respondent 23: ID 3.

Respondent 22: ID 3.

Respondent 19: ID 3.

Respondent 20: ID 3.

Respondent 14: ID 3.

Respondent 4: ID 3.

All of them have Identification 3. So the answer is ""Introduces themselves and information is complete"".

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Assessment of the respondent whose score for 'Background (history)' was 2 and score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' was 2?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the Assessment score for the respondent who has a Background (history) score of 2 and a Recommendation (clear recommendation) score of 2. 

First, I need to look through each respondent's data in the provided survey responses. Let me go through each one systematically.

Starting with Respondent 7: Their Background (history) is 2, and Recommendation (clear recommendation) is 2. So this matches the criteria. Their Assessment score is 2. But I should check if there are other respondents that also meet these criteria.

Next, Respondent 22: Background (history) is 3, which doesn't match. Skip.

Respondent 11: Background (history) is 3. Doesn't match. Skip.

Respondent 8: Background (history) is 3. No match.

Respondent 9: Background (history) is 2, but their Recommendation (clear recommendation) is 3. Doesn't meet both criteria.

Respondent 13: Background (history) is 2, and Recommendation (clear recommendation) is 2. Here, their Assessment is 2. So that's another match.

Respondent 5: Background (history) is 3. Doesn't fit.

Respondent 10: Background (history) is 2, and Recommendation (clear recommendation) is 2. Their Assessment is 2. Third match.

Respondent 20: Background (history) is 2, but their Recommendation (clear recommendation) is 2. Wait, no, their Background (history) is 2, and Recommendation (clear recommendation) is 2. So Assessment here is 3. Wait, let me check again. Respondent 20's Background (history) is 2, and Recommendation (clear recommendation) is 2. Their Assessment is 3. So that's a fourth respondent. Wait, but the question is asking for the Assessment score of the respondent(s) with those two scores. So there might be multiple respondents. But the answer needs to be the Assessment score. Wait, but the question is phrased as ""the respondent"", which might imply a single answer. Wait, let me check the data again.

Wait, let's list all respondents with Background (history) 2 and Recommendation (clear recommendation) 2:

- Respondent 7: Assessment 2
- Respondent 13: Assessment 2
- Respondent 10: Assessment 2
- Respondent 20: Background (history) is 2, Recommendation (clear recommendation) is 2. Their Assessment is 3. Wait, no. Let me check Respondent 20's data again. 

Looking at Respondent 20's entry:
Background (history): 2
Recommendation (clear recommendation): 2
Assessment: 3

So that's another one, but their Assessment is 3. So if the question is asking for the Assessment score of the respondent(s) with those two scores, then there are multiple respondents. But the answer might be multiple values. However, the example given in the problem shows that when there are multiple respondents, the answer is the correct one. Wait, the example question was about a specific session on a specific date, and the answer was 2. But in this task, the question is to find the Assessment score where Background (history) is 2 and Recommendation (clear recommendation) is 2. So there could be multiple respondents. But the answer needs to be the Assessment score(s) of those respondents. 

Wait, the task says ""the respondent"", which might imply singular, but the data might have multiple. Let me check again.

Looking back:

Respondent 7: Background (history) 2, Recommendation (clear recommendation) 2 → Assessment 2

Respondent 13: Background (history) 2, Recommendation (clear recommendation) 2 → Assessment 2

Respondent 10: Background (history) 2, Recommendation (clear recommendation) 2 → Assessment 2

Respondent 20: Background (history) 2, Recommendation (clear recommendation) 2 → Assessment 3

Wait, so three respondents (7,13,10) have both scores 2 and 2, and their Assessment is 2. Respondent 20 has Background (history) 2, Recommendation (clear recommendation) 2, but Assessment 3. So the answer would be 2 for the first three, and 3 for Respondent 20. But the question is asking for the Assessment of the respondent(s) with those two scores. So if there are multiple, the answer would be a list. But the output rules say for a list, provide a comma-separated list. However, the example answer was a single number. Wait, the example had a single respondent matching, so the answer was 2. In this case, there are multiple respondents. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with Respondent 20. Let me check their data again:

Respondent 20:
  Date: 2025-05-02
  SessionName: IV (VT)
  Identification: 3
  Situation: 3
  Background (history): 2
  Background (examination): -1
  Assessment: 3
  Recommendation (clear recommendation): 2
  Recommendation (global rating scale): 3
  Comments: Good

Yes, their Background (history) is 2, Recommendation (clear recommendation) is 2. So their Assessment is 3. So that's a fourth respondent. So the respondents meeting the criteria are 7,13,10,20. Wait, no: Respondent 7: Assessment 2; 13: 2; 10:2; 20:3. So three have Assessment 2 and one has 3. But the question is asking for the Assessment of the respondent(s) with those two scores. So the answer would be 2 and 3. But the output rules say if the question asks for a list, provide a comma-separated list. However, the task is phrased as ""What is the Assessment..."", which might expect a single value. But according to the data, there are multiple respondents. So perhaps the answer is 2,3. But I need to check the output rules again.

The output rules state: ""If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., '17, 21, 23')"". But here, the question is asking for the Assessment score(s), which are numerical. The example given in the problem had a single answer (2). However, in this case, there are multiple respondents. But the question is phrased as ""the respondent"", which is singular. Wait, perhaps the question is intended to find all respondents that meet the criteria and report their Assessment scores. But the way the question is phrased is ambiguous. Let me re-read the task.

The task is: ""What is the Assessment of the respondent whose score for 'Background (history)' was 2 and score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' was 2?""

The use of ""the respondent"" suggests a singular answer, but there might be multiple. However, in the data, there are multiple respondents. So perhaps the answer is a list of their Assessment scores. But according to the output rules, if it's a count, provide the number. If it's a list, comma-separated. But the question is asking for the Assessment, which is a score. So if multiple respondents meet the criteria, their Assessment scores should be listed. 

Looking at the data:

- Respondent 7: Assessment 2
- Respondent 13: Assessment 2
- Respondent 10: Assessment 2
- Respondent 20: Assessment 3

So four respondents meet the criteria, but their Assessment scores are 2,2,2,3. So the answer would be 2,2,2,3. But the output rules say to provide the human-readable value. However, the Assessment rubric is a numerical score. The question is asking for the Assessment score, which is a number. So the answer would be the numbers corresponding to each matching respondent. But the output rules for the example show that the answer is a single number (2). So perhaps in this case, the answer is multiple numbers. But the output instructions say to provide the answer directly and concisely. 

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake. Let me check each respondent again:

Respondent 7: Background (history) 2, Recommendation (clear recommendation) 2 → Assessment 2.

Respondent 13: Background (history) 2, Recommendation (clear recommendation) 2 → Assessment 2.

Respondent 10: Background (history) 2, Recommendation (clear recommendation) 2 → Assessment 2.

Respondent 20: Background (history) 2, Recommendation (clear recommendation) 2 → Assessment 3.

So four respondents. But the answer would be 2,2,2,3. However, the output rules state that if the question asks for a list, provide a comma-separated list. But the question is phrased as ""What is the Assessment..."", which is singular. This is conflicting. Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in my analysis. Let me check again.

Wait, Respondent 20's Background (history) is 2, and Recommendation (clear recommendation) is 2. So they meet the criteria, and their Assessment is 3. So the answer includes 3. But the other three have Assessment 2. So the correct answer is 2 and 3. But how to present this? The output rules say to provide the human-readable value, which for the Assessment is the numerical score. So if there are multiple, perhaps list them all. But the example in the problem had a single answer, but that's because there was only one respondent matching the criteria. Here, there are multiple. So the answer should be a list of the Assessment scores. 

But the output instructions say: ""Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code."" So if the answer is multiple values, perhaps list them separated by commas. But the example answer was ""2"", which is a single value. However, in this case, there are multiple respondents. So the answer would be ""2, 2, 2, 3"". But I need to check if the question allows for multiple answers. The task is phrased as ""the respondent"", which is singular, but the data has multiple. This could be a trick question where only one respondent meets both criteria. Wait, let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with Respondent 20. Let me check their 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' score. The data says:

Respondent 20:
  Recommendation (clear recommendation): 2

Yes, so they do meet the criteria. So their Assessment is 3. So the answer includes 3. But the other three have Assessment 2. So the answer is multiple values. However, the output rules don't specify how to handle multiple answers unless it's a list of names or IDs. The task is asking for the Assessment, which is a numerical value. So perhaps the answer is ""2, 3"". But how many respondents have each?

Wait, three respondents have Assessment 2 and one has 3. So the answer would be 2, 2, 2, 3. But maybe the question expects all possible Assessment scores for respondents meeting the criteria. Alternatively, perhaps the question is looking for the possible values, but that's not clear. Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the data entry. For example, Respondent 20's Background (examination) is -1, which is not part of the rubric (rubric is 0-3). But that's probably a typo, but the question is about Background (history) and Recommendation (clear recommendation), so that's not relevant here.

In conclusion, the correct answer is that the Assessment scores are 2 and 3. But since the question is asking for ""the Assessment"", which could be plural, but the output format requires a concise answer. However, according to the data, there are four respondents meeting the criteria with Assessment scores 2,2,2,3. So the answer should list all of them. But the output rules say for a list, comma-separated. So the answer is ""2, 2, 2, 3"". But I need to check if the question allows for multiple answers. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in identifying the respondents. Let me check once more.

Wait, Respondent 10: Date 2025-03-14, SessionName (MI)-VT. Their Background (history) is 2, Recommendation (clear recommendation) is 2. Assessment is 2. Correct.

Respondent 20: Background (history) 2, Recommendation (clear recommendation) 2. Assessment 3. Correct.

So the answer is that there are four respondents, three with Assessment 2 and one with 3. But the question is phrased as ""the respondent"", which is singular, but the data has multiple. This might be a mistake in the question, but as per the data, the answer should include all matching Assessments. However, the example given in the problem had a single answer. Maybe the intended answer is 2, but there's a respondent with Assessment 3. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a typo. But according to the data, the answer is 2 and 3. But how to present this? The output rules don't specify, but the example used a single number. Maybe the correct answer is 2 and 3, but the user expects all possible values. Alternatively, perhaps I missed a respondent. Let me check again.

Wait, another respondent: Respondent 6. Their Background (history) is 3, so they don't meet the criteria. Respondent 5: Background (history) 3. So no. So the four respondents are 7,13,10,20. Their Assessments: 2,2,2,3. So the answer is 2,2,2,3. But the output rules say to provide the human-readable value. Since the question is asking for the Assessment, which is a numerical score, the answer should list all of them. However, the example answer was a single number. But in this case, there are multiple. So the answer is ""2, 2, 2, 3"". But I need to check if the output should aggregate or list all. The output instructions say for a list, comma-separated. So the answer is ""2, 2, 2, 3"".

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Recommendation (global rating scale) of the respondent with the highest Background (history) in the 'III - Sepsis' session?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the Recommendation (global rating scale) of the respondent with the highest Background (history) in the 'III - Sepsis' session. 

First, I need to parse the data provided. Let's start by identifying all respondents who participated in the 'III - Sepsis' session. Looking through the responses:

- Respondent 15: SessionName is 'III - Sepsis'
- Respondent 4: SessionName is 'III (Sepsis)'
- Respondent 3: SessionName is 'III-Sepsis'
- Respondent 7: SessionName is 'III-Sepsis'

Hmm, the session names have slight variations in formatting, like hyphens and parentheses, but they all refer to 'Sepsis' under session III. So, I should consider all these respondents as part of the 'III - Sepsis' session group.

Next, I need to check their Background (history) scores. Let's list them out:

- Respondent 15: Background (history) = 2
- Respondent 4: Background (history) = 3
- Respondent 3: Background (history) = 3
- Respondent 7: Background (history) = 2

So, the highest Background (history) score here is 3, achieved by both Respondent 4 and Respondent 3. Now, since the question asks for the respondent with the highest score, and there's a tie, I need to check if there's a way to determine a single highest. But the question doesn't specify handling ties, so perhaps both would be considered. However, the task is to find the Recommendation (global rating scale) for that respondent. Wait, but if there are two respondents with the same highest score, do they both have the same global rating scale?

Looking at their Recommendation (global rating scale):

- Respondent 4: 2
- Respondent 3: 3

So, Respondent 3 has a higher global rating scale. But wait, the question is asking for the global rating scale of the respondent with the highest Background (history). Since both have the highest Background (history) score of 3, but different global ratings, how to proceed? The question might be expecting the highest among them, but the way the question is phrased, it's the global rating of the respondent(s) with the highest Background. If there are multiple, perhaps we need to list all, but the output format expects a single answer. Let me check the data again.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recheck the respondents:

Respondent 3's SessionName is 'III-Sepsis' and Date is 2025-04-04. Their Background (history) is 3, and their Recommendation (global rating scale) is 3.

Respondent 4's SessionName is 'III (Sepsis)' on 2025-05-16, Background (history) 3, and global rating 2.

So both have the same Background (history) score. The question asks for the global rating of the respondent with the highest Background (history) in that session. Since there are two, but the answer might require the highest among them. But the question is phrased as ""the respondent"", which could imply that if there's a tie, perhaps the answer is the one with the higher global rating? Or maybe the question expects all possible answers. However, the output rules state to provide a simple answer. Let me check the original example given. In the example, the answer was a single number. So perhaps in this case, if there are multiple respondents with the highest Background (history), we need to check their global rating scales. But the question is asking for the global rating of the respondent with the highest Background. If there are multiple, perhaps the answer is the highest global rating among them. But that's not necessarily correct. Alternatively, maybe the answer is to list all, but the output format might not allow that. Let me re-examine the task again.

The task says: ""What is the Recommendation (global rating scale) of the respondent with the highest Background (history) in the 'III - Sepsis' session?""

So, the respondent with the highest Background (history) in that session. If multiple respondents have the same highest score, then there are multiple respondents. But the answer expects a single value. However, in the data, Respondent 3 and 4 both have Background (history) 3. But their global ratings are 3 and 2, respectively. So, the answer would be 3 and 2. But the output format requires a single answer. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the session names. Let me check again.

Wait, the session name in the task is 'III - Sepsis' (with a space and hyphen). In the data:

- Respondent 15: 'III - Sepsis' (matches exactly)
- Respondent 4: 'III (Sepsis)' (parentheses instead of hyphen)
- Respondent 3: 'III-Sepsis' (hyphen without space)
- Respondent 7: 'III-Sepsis' (same as 3)

The question is whether these variations are considered the same session. The example given in the initial data had 'II (Anaphylaxsis)' and the answer was correctly found. So, perhaps the session names are considered the same if they refer to the same session number and condition, regardless of formatting. So, all variations of 'III' and 'Sepsis' are considered the same session. Therefore, Respondents 15, 4, 3, and 7 are all part of the 'III - Sepsis' session.

But in that case, the highest Background (history) is 3 (Respondents 3 and 4). Their global ratings are 3 and 2. The question is asking for the global rating of the respondent with the highest Background (history). If there are multiple, perhaps the answer is the highest among them, but that's not what the question is asking. The question is asking for the global rating of that respondent (those respondents). So, if there are two respondents, the answer would be both 3 and 2. But the output format requires a single value. This is a problem.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the data. Let me check again:

Respondent 3's SessionName is 'III-Sepsis' and Date is 2025-04-04. Their Background (history) is 3, and global rating is 3.

Respondent 4's SessionName is 'III (Sepsis)' and Date is 2025-05-16. Background (history) 3, global rating 2.

So, both are in III-Sepsis sessions. The highest Background (history) is 3. Both have that. Therefore, the answer should include both global ratings. But the output format requires a single answer. This is conflicting. However, looking back at the example provided, the answer was a single value. So perhaps in this case, the correct approach is to take the highest Background (history) and if there are multiple, pick the one with the highest global rating. But that's an assumption. Alternatively, maybe the question expects all possible answers, but the output format doesn't allow that. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the session names. Let me check the exact session name in the task: 'III - Sepsis' (with a space and hyphen). In the data, only Respondent 15 has exactly 'III - Sepsis'. The others have variations. So maybe the task is specifically referring to the session named exactly 'III - Sepsis', not other variations. If that's the case, then only Respondent 15 is considered. But that would be a mistake because in the example, the session name was 'II (Anaphylaxsis)' and the answer was found in a respondent with 'II (Anaphylaxsis)' as the session name. So, perhaps the session name must match exactly, including formatting. Let's check:

The task's session is 'III - Sepsis' (with a space, hyphen, space). In the data:

- Respondent 15: SessionName: 'III - Sepsis' (matches exactly)
- Respondent 4: 'III (Sepsis)' (different formatting)
- Respondent 3: 'III-Sepsis' (different formatting)
- Respondent 7: 'III-Sepsis' (different formatting)

If the session name must match exactly, then only Respondent 15 is in 'III - Sepsis'. But that seems unlikely because in the example, the session name was 'II (Anaphylaxsis)' and the answer was found in a respondent with the same session name. So, perhaps the session name variations are considered the same. However, the user might have intended that. Alternatively, maybe the session names are case-sensitive, but in this case, they are all uppercase. 

Alternatively, perhaps the session name is considered the same if the session number and condition match, regardless of formatting. For example, 'III - Sepsis', 'III (Sepsis)', 'III-Sepsis' are all considered the same session. Therefore, all four respondents (15,4,3,7) are part of the same session. 

In that case, the highest Background (history) is 3 (Respondents 3 and 4). Their global ratings are 3 and 2. The question asks for the global rating of the respondent with the highest Background (history). If there are two respondents, the answer would be both 3 and 2. But the output format requires a single answer. This is a problem. However, looking at the data again, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the Background (history) scores again:

Respondent 3: Background (history) = 3
Respondent 4: Background (history) = 3
Respondent 15: 2
Respondent 7: 2

So, the highest is 3. Both 3 and 4 have that. Now, the task is to find the global rating of the respondent with the highest Background (history). If there are two, but the output requires a single value, perhaps the answer is both 3 and 2. But the output rules say to provide a simple answer. Alternatively, maybe the question expects the highest global rating among those with the highest Background. In that case, Respondent 3 has 3, which is higher than Respondent 4's 2. So the answer would be 3. But the question is not asking for the highest global rating, but the global rating of the respondent with the highest Background. So if there are two respondents, the answer should include both. However, the output format might not allow that. 

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the session names. Let me check the exact session name in the task: 'III - Sepsis' (with spaces around the hyphen). In the data, only Respondent 15 has that exact session name. The others have different formats. If the session name must match exactly, then only Respondent 15 is considered. His Background (history) is 2. Then the highest in that session would be 2. But that can't be right because other respondents in other formats have higher scores. 

This is a bit confusing. The example given in the initial problem had the session name 'II (Anaphylaxsis)' and the answer was found in a respondent with the same session name. So perhaps the session name must match exactly. Therefore, in this case, the task is asking for 'III - Sepsis' exactly. Only Respondent 15 has that. His Background (history) is 2, which is not the highest. But that contradicts the other respondents. 

Alternatively, maybe the session name variations are considered the same. For example, 'III - Sepsis', 'III (Sepsis)', 'III-Sepsis' are all considered the same session. In that case, the highest Background (history) is 3 (Respondents 3 and 4). Their global ratings are 3 and 2. So the answer would be both 3 and 2, but the output format requires a single value. This is a problem. 

Wait, perhaps the task is a trick question. Let me check the data again. The task is to find the Recommendation (global rating scale) of the respondent with the highest Background (history) in the 'III - Sepsis' session. If the session is 'III - Sepsis' exactly, then only Respondent 15 is in that session. His Background (history) is 2. Then the highest in that session is 2. But then there's no one with a higher score. But that can't be right because other respondents in other sessions have higher scores. 

Alternatively, perhaps the session name is considered to be 'III' and 'Sepsis' regardless of formatting. So all variations are included. Then the highest Background (history) is 3 (Respondents 3 and 4). Their global ratings are 3 and 2. So the answer would be 3 and 2. But the output requires a single answer. 

This is a dilemma. The answer depends on whether session name variations are considered the same. Given that in the example, the session name was 'II (Anaphylaxsis)' and the correct respondent had the same session name, perhaps the session name must match exactly. Therefore, in this case, the session 'III - Sepsis' only includes Respondent 15. His Background (history) is 2, which is the highest in that exact session. But then the answer would be 2. But that seems odd because other respondents in similar sessions have higher scores. 

Alternatively, maybe the user intended to include all variations. In that case, the answer would be 3 (from Respondent 3) and 2 (from Respondent 4). But how to present that? The output rules say to provide a simple answer, so maybe list them as comma-separated. But the example answer was a single number. 

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the data. Let me check again. 

Wait, Respondent 3's SessionName is 'III-Sepsis' and Date is 2025-04-04. The task is about the 'III - Sepsis' session. If the session name is considered the same regardless of formatting, then Respondent 3 is part of that session. But if not, then not. 

Given the ambiguity, but following the example where the session name was matched exactly, perhaps the correct approach is to consider only the exact match. Therefore, only Respondent 15 is in 'III - Sepsis' session. His Background (history) is 2. Therefore, the highest in that session is 2. But then the answer would be 2. However, the question is asking for the global rating of the respondent with the highest Background (history) in that session. If the highest is 2, then the global rating is 2. But that seems counterintuitive because other respondents in similar sessions have higher scores. 

Alternatively, perhaps the session name variations are considered the same. Then the highest Background (history) is 3, and the global ratings are 3 and 2. But the output needs a single answer. 

Wait, the task says: ""the respondent with the highest Background (history)"". If there are multiple respondents with the same highest score, then the answer would be the global ratings of all those respondents. But the output format requires a single value. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is 3, as Respondent 3 has a higher global rating than Respondent 4. But the question doesn't specify to take the highest global rating, just the global rating of the respondent with the highest Background. 

This is a bit of a problem. Given the ambiguity, but based on the example where the session name was matched exactly, perhaps the correct answer is 2, considering only Respondent 15. But that doesn't make sense because other respondents have higher scores. Alternatively, the user might have intended to include all variations, leading to the answer 3 and 2. But the output format doesn't allow that. 

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the data. Let me check again. 

Wait, Respondent 3's SessionName is 'III-Sepsis' and Date is 2025-04-04. The task is about 'III - Sepsis' session. If the session name is considered the same, then Respondent 3 is included. His Background (history) is 3, which is the highest. His global rating is 3. Therefore, the answer is 3. 

But why is Respondent 4 included? His SessionName is 'III (Sepsis)', which is a different formatting. If the session name variations are considered the same, then he's included. His Background (history) is 3, global rating 2. So the answer would be 3 and 2. But the output requires a single value. 

Given the confusion, perhaps the intended answer is 3, as Respondent 3 has the highest Background (history) and the highest global rating among those with the highest Background. But this is an assumption. 

Alternatively, the correct answer is 2, considering only Respondent 15. But that seems incorrect. 

Alternatively, the session name 'III - Sepsis' includes all variations, and the highest Background is 3 (Respondents 3 and 4). Their global ratings are 3 and 2. The answer would be both, but the output format requires a single value. 

This is a problem. However, looking back at the data, perhaps the highest Background (history) in the 'III - Sepsis' session (exact match) is 2 (Respondent 15). Therefore, the answer is 2. But that seems low. 

Alternatively, the user might have intended that the session name variations are considered the same. Therefore, the answer is 3 (Respondent 3) and 2 (Respondent 4). But how to present that. 

Given the output rules, if the question asks for a list, the answer would be ""3, 2"". But the task is asking for the Recommendation (global rating scale) of the respondent with the highest Background (history). If there are two respondents, their global ratings are 3 and 2. But the output must be a single value. 

This is a conflict. However, perhaps the correct approach is to list all possible answers. But the example answer was a single number. 

Alternatively, perhaps the highest Background (history) is 3, and among those, the highest global rating is 3. Therefore, the answer is 3. 

But the question doesn't ask for the highest global rating, just the global rating of the respondent with the highest Background. If there are multiple respondents, perhaps the answer is both. But the output format doesn't allow that. 

Given the ambiguity, but based on the data and the example, I think the intended answer is 3. Because Respondent 3 has the highest Background (history) of 3 and a global rating of 3. Even though the session",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Situation of the respondent whose score for 'Situation' was 3 and score for 'Background (examination)' was 3?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the Situation of the respondent who scored 3 in both 'Situation' and 'Background (examination)'. 

First, I need to look through each respondent's data. Let's start with Respondent 12. Their Situation is 3, and Background (examination) is also 3. That matches the criteria. The Situation question's rubric says a score of 3 means they identified and prioritized the main problems without prompting. So the answer here would be the value from the Situation field, which is 3. But according to the output rules, I need to map the numerical score to the corresponding rubric text.

Wait, the question is asking for the ""Situation"" of the respondent, which is the actual text value from the Situation field. Wait no, the Situation field in the responses is a numerical score. Wait, no, looking back at the data structure: the Questions section lists each question, and the Responses have numerical scores for each. The Situation question is question 4, which is scored 0-3. The task is asking for the ""Situation"" of the respondent, but the Situation in the responses is a numerical value. Wait, no, the Situation in the responses is the score. Wait, the question is phrased as ""What is the Situation of the respondent..."". But according to the data, the Situation is a rubric-based score. Wait, maybe the user is confused here. Let me check the original task again.

The task says: ""What is the Situation of the respondent whose score for 'Situation' was 3 and score for 'Background (examination)' was 3?"" So they want the actual Situation value (the text description) for the respondent who has a score of 3 in both 'Situation' and 'Background (examination)'. Wait, but in the data, the Situation is a numerical score. The Situation question's possible answers are the rubric: 0 = Unable to identify..., 3 = Identifies and prioritizes the main problem(s) unprompted. So the answer should be the text corresponding to the score 3 for the Situation question. So the answer is ""Identifies and prioritizes the main problem(s) unprompted"".

But first, I need to find which respondent(s) have Situation=3 and Background (examination)=3. Let's check each respondent:

Respondent 12: Situation=3, Background (examination)=3. So this one matches.

Respondent 3: Situation=2, Background (examination)=3. Doesn't match.

Respondent 8: Situation=3, Background (examination)=2. Doesn't match.

Respondent 23: Situation=3, Background (examination)=2. Doesn't match.

Respondent 10: Situation=2, Background (examination)=2. No.

Respondent 6: Situation=2, Background (examination)=3. So Situation is 2, so no.

Respondent 15: Situation=3, Background (examination)=3. Wait, here's another one. Situation=3, Background (examination)=3. So both 12 and 15 have these scores. Wait, let me check:

Respondent 15's data:

Date: 2025-05-04

SessionName: III - Sepsis

Identification: 3

Situation: 3

Background (history): 2

Background (examination): 3

Assessment: 2

Recommendation (clear recommendation): 2

Recommendation (global rating scale): 2

Comments: Detailed Response - clear communication

So yes, both Respondent 12 and 15 have Situation=3 and Background (examination)=3. Wait, but the task is to find the Situation of the respondent(s) who meet these criteria. Wait, but the answer should be the text description of the Situation score, which is the same for all who scored 3. But maybe the question is asking for the actual Situation value, which is the score. Wait, no, the question is phrased as ""What is the Situation of the respondent..."", but in the data, the Situation is a numerical score. However, according to the output rules, for MCQ fields, we need to map the code to the corresponding text from the rubric. So the Situation field is a rubric-based score, so the answer should be the text corresponding to the score 3, which is ""Identifies and prioritizes the main problem(s) unprompted"".

But wait, the task is to find the Situation of the respondent(s) who have those two scores. So if there are multiple respondents, we need to list all their Situations. But since the Situation score is 3 for both, the answer would be the same. However, looking at the data again, Respondent 12 and 15 both have Situation=3 and Background (examination)=3. Wait, no: Respondent 12's Background (examination) is 3, and their Situation is 3. Respondent 15's Background (examination) is 3, and their Situation is 3. So both meet the criteria. Therefore, the answer would be the text for Situation score 3, which is ""Identifies and prioritizes the main problem(s) unprompted"". But the question is asking for the Situation of the respondent(s) who meet the criteria. Since both have the same Situation score, the answer is the same. However, the output rules say to provide the human-readable value, not the code. So regardless of how many respondents meet the criteria, the answer is the text corresponding to the Situation score of 3. Therefore, the answer is ""Identifies and prioritizes the main problem(s) unprompted"".

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Identification of the respondent whose score for 'Background (history)' was 2 and score for 'Assessment' was 3?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the Identification score of the respondent who has a Background (history) score of 2 and an Assessment score of 3. 

First, I need to look through all the respondents in the provided data. Let me go through each one by one.

Starting with Respondent 1: Their Background (history) is 2, and Assessment is 3. But wait, their Identification is -1. Wait, the rubric for Identification goes from 0 to 3. A score of -1 might be a typo, but according to the data, it's -1. However, the question is asking for someone with Background (history) 2 and Assessment 3. So this respondent meets those criteria, but the Identification is -1. But the possible options for Identification are 0-3, so maybe this is an error. But according to the data, that's their score. Hmm.

Next, Respondent 22: Background (history) is 3, so that's not 2. Skip.

Respondent 18: Background (history) is 2, Assessment is 3. Identification here is 3. So this is a possible candidate. But wait, the question is asking for the Identification of the respondent with those scores. So this would be 3. But let's check others.

Respondent 10: Background (history) is 2, Assessment is 2. So no.

Respondent 4: Background (history) is 3. No.

Respondent 5: Background (history) is 3, so no.

Respondent 9: Background (history) is 2, Assessment is 2. No.

Respondent 19: Background (history) is 3. No.

Respondent 15: Background (history) is 2, Assessment is 2. No.

Respondent 2: Background (history) is 2, Assessment is 3. Here, Identification is 3. So this is another candidate. Wait, but the date for Respondent 2 is 2025-04-04, and the SessionName is MI. But the question doesn't specify date or session, just the scores. So both Respondent 1, 18, 2, and maybe others?

Wait, let me check again. The task is to find the Identification where Background (history) is 2 and Assessment is 3. Let's list all respondents with those two scores.

Looking again:

Respondent 1: Background (history) 2, Assessment 3. Identification -1. But the rubric for Identification is 0-3. Maybe a typo, but the data says -1. However, the answer options in the example had numbers like 2, so maybe this is possible. But the user's example answer was 2, but that's a different question. Here, the answer might be -1, but according to the schema, Identification is 0-3. So perhaps this is an error, but the data shows -1. But the question is asking for the Identification value as per the data, regardless of the rubric's validity. So if the data says -1, that's the answer. But maybe the user made a typo. Alternatively, maybe there's another respondent.

Wait, Respondent 18: Background (history) 2, Assessment 3. Identification 3.

Respondent 2: Background (history) 2, Assessment 3. Identification 3.

Wait, Respondent 2's Background (history) is 2, Assessment is 3. So their Identification is 3. But the question is asking for the Identification of the respondent with those scores. So there are two respondents: Respondent 1 (with Identification -1) and Respondent 18 (3), Respondent 2 (3). Wait, no, Respondent 1's Background (history) is 2, Assessment is 3. So that's three respondents? Let me check again.

Wait, let's list all:

- Respondent 1: Background (history) 2, Assessment 3. Identification -1.

- Respondent 18: Background (history) 2, Assessment 3. Identification 3.

- Respondent 2: Background (history) 2, Assessment 3. Identification 3.

Wait, no. Wait, Respondent 2's Background (history) is 2? Let me check:

Respondent 2's data:

Background (history): 2

Assessment: 3

Yes. So Respondent 2 has Background (history) 2 and Assessment 3. So their Identification is 3.

So there are three respondents: 1, 18, and 2. But the question is asking for the Identification of the respondent(s) with those scores. But the answer should be the value(s) of Identification for those respondents.

Wait, but the question is phrased as ""the respondent"", which might imply a single respondent, but there could be multiple. However, looking at the data:

Respondent 1: Identification -1 (but schema says 0-3, possible data entry error)

Respondent 18: Identification 3

Respondent 2: Identification 3

So the answer could be -1, 3, 3. But the question is asking for the Identification of the respondent(s) with those scores. If there are multiple, the answer would be a list. But the output rules say if it's a list, provide a comma-separated list. However, the task says ""the respondent"", which might be singular, but the data may have multiple. Let me check again.

Wait, let's recheck all respondents:

Respondent 1: Date 2025-05-02, Session V (Hypoglycemia). Background (history) 2, Assessment 3. Identification -1.

Respondent 18: Date 2025-05-04, Session IV - VT. Background (history) 2, Assessment 3. Identification 3.

Respondent 2: Date 2025-04-04, Session MI. Background (history) 2, Assessment 3. Identification 3.

So three respondents meet the criteria. But the question is asking for ""the respondent"", which might be a mistake, but the data shows three. However, the answer needs to be the Identification scores. So the answer would be -1, 3, 3. But according to the output rules, if it's a list, provide a comma-separated list. So the answer would be ""-1, 3, 3"". But the schema for Identification is 0-3, so -1 is invalid. But the data shows it. So perhaps the answer includes all three. But maybe the user intended only one. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me go through each respondent again:

Respondent 1: Background (history) 2, Assessment 3. Identification -1.

Respondent 18: Background (history) 2, Assessment 3. Identification 3.

Respondent 2: Background (history) 2, Assessment 3. Identification 3.

Respondent 12: Background (history) 3, so no.

Respondent 17: Background (history) 3, so no.

So three respondents. But the answer should list all their Identification scores. However, the output rules say if the question asks for a list, provide a comma-separated list. So the answer is ""-1, 3, 3"". But the user might expect only the valid ones. But according to the data, it's -1, 3, 3. So the answer is those three values. But the output rules state to provide the human-readable value. Wait, the Identification is a rubric score, so the answer is the numerical value. The question is asking for the Identification score, which is a number. So the answer is the numbers. So the answer would be ""-1, 3, 3"". But the example in the problem had an answer of ""2"", which was a single value. But in this case, there are three respondents. However, the user's task might have a typo, but according to the data, there are three. But let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check each respondent again:

Looking at all respondents:

- Respondent 1: Background (history) 2, Assessment 3. Identification -1.

- Respondent 18: Background (history) 2, Assessment 3. Identification 3.

- Respondent 2: Background (history) 2, Assessment 3. Identification 3.

Yes, three respondents. So the answer is their Identification scores: -1, 3, 3. But the output rules say to provide a simple comma-separated list. So the answer is ""-1, 3, 3"". However, the rubric for Identification is 0-3, so -1 is invalid, but the data shows it. So according to the data, that's the answer. But maybe the user intended to have only one, but the data has three. So the correct answer is the list of those three.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Situation of the respondent with the highest Recommendation (clear recommendation) in the 'II - Anaphylaxsis' session?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the Situation score of the respondent with the highest Recommendation (clear recommendation) in the 'II - Anaphylaxsis' session.

First, I need to filter all respondents who participated in the session named 'II - Anaphylaxsis'. Looking at the data, the SessionName can have variations like ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"", ""II-Anaphylaxsis"", and ""II - Anaphylaxsis"". So I need to check all these possibilities.

Looking through the responses:

- Respondent 9: SessionName is ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"", Date 2025-05-04
- Respondent 23: SessionName is ""II-Anaphylaxsis"", Date 2025-03-14
- Respondent 5: SessionName is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"", Date 2025-05-04

These three have session names that match variations of 'II - Anaphylaxsis'. Now, I need to look at their Recommendation (clear recommendation) scores.

Respondent 9: Recommendation (clear recommendation) is 3
Respondent 23: Recommendation (clear recommendation) is 3
Respondent 5: Recommendation (clear recommendation) is 2

So the highest score here is 3, achieved by both Respondent 9 and 23. Now, among these two, I need to check their Situation scores.

Respondent 9: Situation is 3
Respondent 23: Situation is 3

Both have the same highest Recommendation score and the same Situation score. Therefore, the answer should be the Situation score of 3, which according to the rubric corresponds to ""Identifies and prioritizes the main problem(s) unprompted"".

</output>

<task>
What is the Recommendation (global rating scale) of the respondent with the highest Recommendation (global rating scale) in the 'II (Anaphylaxsis)' session?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the Recommendation (global rating scale) of the respondent with the highest Recommendation (global rating scale) in the 'II (Anaphylaxsis)' session.

First, I need to identify all respondents who participated in the session named 'II (Anaphylaxsis)'. Let me go through each respondent in the data.

Looking at the Responses section:

- Respondent 9:
  - Date: 2025-05-04
  - SessionName: II (Anaphylaxsis)
  - Recommendation (global rating scale): 2

- Respondent 5:
  - Date: 2025-05-04
  - SessionName: II - Anaphylaxsis
  - Recommendation (global rating scale): 3

Wait, the session names are slightly different. Respondent 9's session is ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"" and Respondent 5's is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"". But the task mentions 'II (Anaphylaxsis)', so I need to check if these are considered the same session. The hyphen vs. parentheses might be a formatting difference. Since the session content is about Anaphylaxis, it's possible they are the same session but with different formatting. The date for both is 2025-05-04, which matches the example's target date. So both respondents 9 and 5 are part of the same session.

Now, looking at their global rating scale scores: Respondent 9 has 2, and Respondent 5 has 3. The highest among them is 3. 

According to the rubric for Question 9 (Recommendation (global rating scale)): 3 = Confident and required little or no questioning. 

So the answer should be the text corresponding to the score 3, which is ""Confident and required little or no questioning"".

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Situation of the respondent whose score for 'Situation' was 3 and score for 'Assessment' was 3?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the Situation of the respondent who scored 3 in both 'Situation' and 'Assessment'. 

First, I need to look through each respondent's data. Let me go through each one:

- **Respondent 6**: Situation is 2, Assessment is 2. Doesn't meet the criteria.
- **Respondent 15**: Situation 3, Assessment 2. Close, but Assessment isn't 3.
- **Respondent 18**: Situation 3, Assessment 3. This matches both scores. The Situation here is ""IV - VT"".
- **Respondent 14**: Situation 3, Assessment 3. Wait, their SessionName is ""IV-Hypoglycemia"". But let me check the other respondents to see if there are more matches.
- **Respondent 21**: Situation 2, so no.
- **Respondent 1**: Situation 2, nope.
- **Respondent 4**: Situation 3, Assessment 2. No.
- **Respondent 3**: Situation 2, so no.
- **Respondent 22**: Situation 3, Assessment 2. No.
- **Respondent 12**: Situation 3, Assessment 2. No.

Wait, so both Respondent 18 and 14 have Situation 3 and Assessment 3. Let me double-check their data. 

Looking at Respondent 18: Date 2025-05-04, SessionName IV - VT, Situation 3, Assessment 3. 

Respondent 14: Date 2025-03-14, SessionName IV-Hypoglycemia, Situation 3, Assessment 3. 

So there are two respondents with both scores as 3. But the question is asking for the ""Situation"" of the respondent. Wait, the question is phrased as ""What is the Situation of the respondent..."". Wait, the 'Situation' here refers to the value of the 'Situation' question, which is a rubric-based score. But the answer should be the actual text of the Situation field, which is the answer to the question ""Identifies the main problem(s)."" But according to the data, the 'Situation' field is a rubric score. Wait, no, looking back at the questions:

Question 4 is ""Situation: Identifies the main problem(s). [Rubric: 0 = ...]"". So the 'Situation' in the responses is a score (0-3), but the question here is asking for the actual Situation value, which is the text that corresponds to the score. Wait, no. Wait, the user's task is: ""What is the Situation of the respondent whose score for 'Situation' was 3 and score for 'Assessment' was 3?"".

Wait, the 'Situation' here refers to the value of the 'Situation' field in the responses, which is a rubric score. But the question is asking for the actual Situation, which is the answer the respondent provided. Wait, no. Wait, the 'Situation' in the data is a rubric score. The question is phrased as ""What is the Situation of the respondent..."", but in the data, the 'Situation' is a score (0-3). But the user is asking for the Situation value (the text) of the respondent who has a score of 3 in both 'Situation' and 'Assessment'. Wait, no. Wait, the 'Situation' in the data is the rubric score. The actual answer the user is looking for is the SessionName, perhaps? Wait, no. Let me re-read the task.

The task says: ""What is the Situation of the respondent whose score for 'Situation' was 3 and score for 'Assessment' was 3?""

Wait, the 'Situation' here refers to the answer to the question ""Situation: Identifies the main problem(s)."" But in the data, the 'Situation' field is a rubric score (0-3). But the actual answer the respondent gave (the main problem they identified) isn't captured in the data provided. The data only shows the rubric score for each question. So perhaps the question is a trick, or maybe there's a misunderstanding. Wait, looking back at the data structure:

In the Responses section, each respondent has fields like 'Situation: 3', which is their score. The actual content of what they identified as the main problem isn't recorded here. The data only includes the scores, not the textual answers. Therefore, the question might be a bit confusing. But according to the data provided, the 'Situation' is a rubric score. So the question is asking for the 'Situation' value (the score) of the respondent who has 3 in both 'Situation' and 'Assessment'. But that would be redundant because the user is asking for the Situation score which is already 3. That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the user is asking for the SessionName of the respondent who scored 3 in both 'Situation' and 'Assessment'? That would make more sense. But the question is phrased as ""What is the Situation of the respondent..."", which is ambiguous. 

Wait, looking at the example provided in the initial part. The example question was: ""What is the Assessment of the respondent from the 'II (Anaphylaxsis)' session on '2025-05-04'?"" The answer was 2, which refers to the Assessment score. So in that case, the answer was the rubric score. But in the current task, the question is phrased as ""What is the Situation of the respondent..."", which would be the rubric score. But the user is asking for the Situation score of someone who has Situation 3 and Assessment 3. But that's redundant. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake and meant to ask for the SessionName. But given the data, perhaps the answer is the SessionName of the respondent(s) who have Situation=3 and Assessment=3. Let me check the data again.

Looking at the respondents:

- Respondent 18: SessionName IV - VT, Situation 3, Assessment 3.
- Respondent 14: SessionName IV-Hypoglycemia, Situation 3, Assessment 3.

So there are two respondents. But the question is asking for the ""Situation"" of the respondent. If ""Situation"" here refers to the SessionName, then the answer would be ""IV - VT"" and ""IV-Hypoglycemia"". But the question's wording is confusing. Alternatively, maybe the user is asking for the actual Situation (the main problem identified), but that data isn't present. The data only has the rubric scores, not the textual answers. Therefore, perhaps the answer is that there are two respondents: 18 and 14. But the question is phrased as ""What is the Situation..."", which would be the rubric score, but they already have Situation=3. So this is confusing. 

Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the question. Alternatively, maybe the answer is the SessionName. Let me check the example again. In the example, the question was about the Assessment (rubric score) of a specific session and date. The answer was 2, which is the rubric score. So in the current task, if the user is asking for the Situation (rubric score) of a respondent who has Situation=3 and Assessment=3, but that's redundant. The answer would be 3. But that doesn't make sense. Therefore, perhaps the user intended to ask for the SessionName of the respondent(s) with Situation=3 and Assessment=3. In that case, the answer would be ""IV - VT"" and ""IV-Hypoglycemia"". But the question's wording is ""What is the Situation..."", which is ambiguous. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is asking for the value of the 'Situation' field (the rubric score) for the respondent who has both 'Situation' and 'Assessment' scores as 3. But since the 'Situation' is already 3, the answer would be 3. But that seems redundant. 

Alternatively, perhaps the user is asking for the 'Situation' field's rubric description. For example, if the 'Situation' score is 3, the rubric says ""Identifies and prioritizes the main problem(s) unprompted"". So the answer would be that description. But according to the output rules, for MCQ fields, we need to map the code to the option text. However, the 'Situation' is a rubric score, which is a numerical value (0-3). The output rules state that for MCQ fields, map any letter codes to the corresponding text. But here, the responses are numerical. The output rules don't specify how to handle numerical rubric scores. But looking at the example, the answer was ""2"", which is the numerical value. So perhaps in this case, the answer is the numerical value. But the current question is asking for the 'Situation' of the respondent who has Situation=3 and Assessment=3, which would be 3. But that's redundant. 

This is confusing. Let me re-examine the task again. The task is: ""What is the Situation of the respondent whose score for 'Situation' was 3 and score for 'Assessment' was 3?"" So the answer should be the 'Situation' value (rubric score) of the respondent(s) who have both 'Situation' and 'Assessment' scores as 3. But since the 'Situation' is already 3, the answer would be 3. But that's redundant. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to ask for the SessionName. 

Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the question. But given the data, the only possible answer is that there are two respondents (18 and 14) with Situation=3 and Assessment=3. But the question is phrased as ""What is the Situation..."", which would be the rubric score. But since both have Situation=3, the answer is 3. However, the example answer was ""2"", which was the numerical value. So perhaps the answer here is 3. But the user might have intended to ask for the SessionName. 

Alternatively, perhaps the user is asking for the 'Situation' field's textual description. For example, a score of 3 in Situation corresponds to ""Identifies and prioritizes the main problem(s) unprompted"". So the answer would be that text. But according to the output rules, for MCQ fields, we need to map the code to the option text. The 'Situation' field's rubric is a scale from 0-3, each with a description. So if the response is 3, the answer should be the corresponding text. 

In the output rules, it says: ""For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both."" But in this case, the responses are numerical (3), and the options are numerical with descriptions. So perhaps the answer should be the text corresponding to the score. 

Looking at the 'Situation' question in the schema: 

4. Situation: Identifies the main problem(s). [Rubric: 0 = Unable to identify the main problem(s), 1 = Identifies the main problem(s) after extended prompting, 2 = Identifies the main problem(s) with fewer prompts needed, 3 = Identifies and prioritizes the main problem(s) unprompted]

So a score of 3 corresponds to ""Identifies and prioritizes the main problem(s) unprompted"". Therefore, the answer for a respondent with Situation=3 would be that text. 

But the task is to find the Situation (the text) of the respondent who has both Situation=3 and Assessment=3. 

Looking at the respondents:

- Respondent 18: Situation=3, so the text is ""Identifies and prioritizes the main problem(s) unprompted"".
- Respondent 14: Situation=3, same text.

But the question is asking for the Situation of the respondent(s) meeting the criteria. So the answer would be the text corresponding to the Situation score of 3. However, since both respondents have the same Situation score, the answer is the same for both. 

But the output rules state that if the question asks for a list, provide a comma-separated list. However, the question is phrased as ""What is the Situation..."", which is singular. But there are two respondents. So perhaps the answer should list both. 

But the example answer was a single value. Let me check the example again. The example question was about a specific session and date, so only one respondent matched. In this case, there are two respondents. 

But the task is to provide the answer according to the output rules. The output rules say: ""If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list"". The question here is asking for the Situation, which is a text value. Since there are two respondents, but the answer is the same for both (since both have Situation=3), the answer is the text corresponding to 3. 

Therefore, the answer is ""Identifies and prioritizes the main problem(s) unprompted"".

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Recommendation (global rating scale) of the respondent whose total score for 'Background (examination)' and 'Assessment' was exactly 5?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the Recommendation (global rating scale) for the respondent whose total score for 'Background (examination)' and 'Assessment' adds up exactly to 5. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The questions section defines each field. The 'Background (examination)' is question 6, and 'Assessment' is question 7. Both are scored on a rubric from 0 to 3. The 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is question 9, also scored 0-3.

Now, I need to go through each respondent in the responses and calculate the sum of their 'Background (examination)' and 'Assessment' scores. Then, check if that sum is exactly 5. Once I find such a respondent, I'll note their score for question 9.

Looking at the respondents:

- Respondent 18: Background (examination) = 2, Assessment = 3. Sum is 5. So their GRS is 2. But wait, the question is asking for the GRS of this respondent. But let me check others to make sure there's no one else.

- Respondent 2: Background (examination) = 3, Assessment = 3. Sum is 6. Not 5.

- Respondent 12: Background (examination) = 3, Assessment = 2. Sum is 5. So their GRS is 3.

Wait, but the question says ""exactly 5"". So both Respondent 18 and 12 have sums of 5. Wait, no: Respondent 18's Background (examination) is 2, Assessment is 3. 2+3=5. Respondent 12's Background (examination) is 3, Assessment is 2. 3+2=5. So both have a sum of 5. But the question is asking for the GRS of the respondent(s) with that sum. However, the answer might be multiple, but the output needs to be the correct one. Wait, let me check all respondents.

Respondent 19: Background (examination) = 3, Assessment = 2. Sum 5. GRS is 3.

Respondent 23: Background (examination) = 2, Assessment =3. Sum 5. GRS is 3.

Respondent 5: Background (examination) =3, Assessment=3. Sum 6. Not.

Respondent 14: Background (examination)=2, Assessment=3. Sum 5. GRS=2.

Respondent 20: Background (examination)=-1, Assessment=3. Sum 2. No.

Respondent 1: Background (examination)=2, Assessment=3. Sum 5. GRS=2.

Wait, so let's list all respondents where sum is 5:

- Respondent 18: sum 5 (2+3), GRS 2.

- Respondent 12: sum 5 (3+2), GRS 3.

- Respondent 19: sum 5 (3+2), GRS 3.

- Respondent 23: sum 5 (2+3), GRS 3.

- Respondent 14: sum 5 (2+3), GRS 2.

- Respondent 1: sum 5 (2+3), GRS 2.

Wait, but the question is asking for the Recommendation (global rating scale) of the respondent(s) whose total for those two fields is exactly 5. So there are multiple respondents here. But the answer might require all of them. However, the example given in the problem shows that the answer is a single value. Wait, but maybe I made a mistake here. Let me recheck each respondent's data.

Looking again:

Respondent 18: Background (examination) = 2, Assessment =3 → 5. GRS=2.

Respondent 12: Background (examination)=3, Assessment=2 →5. GRS=3.

Respondent 19: Background (examination)=3, Assessment=2 →5. GRS=3.

Respondent 23: Background (examination)=2, Assessment=3 →5. GRS=3.

Respondent 14: Background (examination)=2, Assessment=3 →5. GRS=2.

Respondent 1: Background (examination)=2, Assessment=3 →5. GRS=2.

So there are multiple respondents. But the question is phrased as ""the respondent"" (singular). But maybe there's only one. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation. Let me check each again.

Wait, the task says ""the respondent whose total score... was exactly 5"". If there are multiple, the answer would be all their GRS. But the output rules say for a list, provide a comma-separated list. However, the example given in the problem (the first one) had an answer of ""2"", which is a single value. So perhaps in the data provided, there's only one respondent that meets the criteria. Let me check again.

Wait, looking at the data provided in the questionnaire:

Looking at the responses:

Respondent 18: Date 2025-05-04, Session IV - VT. Background (examination)=2, Assessment=3. Sum 5. GRS=2.

Respondent 12: Date 2025-05-02, Session II (Anaphylaxis). Background (examination)=3, Assessment=2. Sum 5. GRS=3.

Respondent 19: Date 2025-05-16, Session I - MI. Background (examination)=3, Assessment=2. Sum 5. GRS=3.

Respondent 23: Date 2025-03-14, Session II-Anaphylaxsis. Background (examination)=2, Assessment=3. Sum 5. GRS=3.

Respondent 14: Date 2025-03-14, Session IV-Hypoglycemia. Background (examination)=2, Assessment=3. Sum 5. GRS=2.

Respondent 1: Date 2025-05-02, Session V (Hypoglycemia). Background (examination)=2, Assessment=3. Sum 5. GRS=2.

So there are six respondents with sum 5. But the question is asking for the GRS of the respondent(s) with that sum. However, the answer might be multiple. But the output rules say if it's a list, provide a comma-separated list. But looking at the example, the answer was a single value, but that's because there was only one respondent matching. Here, there are multiple. So the answer would be the GRS scores for each of these respondents. But the question is phrased as ""the respondent"" (singular), which might be a mistake, but according to the data, there are multiple. However, perhaps I made a mistake in reading the data. Let me check each respondent again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the data. Let me check each respondent's Background (examination) and Assessment:

Respondent 18: Background (examination): 2, Assessment:3 →5. Correct.

Respondent 12: Background (examination):3, Assessment:2 →5. Correct.

Respondent 19: Background (examination):3, Assessment:2 →5. Correct.

Respondent 23: Background (examination):2, Assessment:3 →5. Correct.

Respondent 14: Background (examination):2, Assessment:3 →5. Correct.

Respondent 1: Background (examination):2, Assessment:3 →5. Correct.

So all these six have sum 5. Therefore, their GRS scores are 2,3,3,3,2,2. But the question is asking for the GRS of the respondent(s) with that sum. So the answer would be all these GRS values. However, the output rules state that if the question asks for a list, provide a comma-separated list. But the question is phrased as ""the respondent"" (singular), which might be a typo. But according to the data, there are multiple. However, perhaps the user intended a different approach. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps the user made a typo in the session names. Let me check the data again. The task is to find the GRS for the respondent(s) where Background (examination) + Assessment =5. So regardless of other fields, just sum those two. So the answer would be all the GRS scores for those respondents. But the output rules say if it's a list, provide a comma-separated list. So the answer would be 2,3,3,3,2,2. But looking at the data, the possible GRS values are 2,3,2,3,3,2, etc. Wait, but the example given in the problem had a single answer. However, in this case, there are multiple. But perhaps the user expects all of them. However, the output rules state to provide a simple comma-separated list. So the answer would be ""2,3,3,3,2,2"". But maybe the user expects only the unique values. Let me check the GRS values for each of the six respondents:

Respondent 18: GRS=2

Respondent 12: GRS=3

Respondent 19: GRS=3

Respondent 23: GRS=3

Respondent 14: GRS=2

Respondent 1: GRS=2

So the GRS values are 2,3,3,3,2,2. So the unique values are 2 and 3. But the question is asking for the GRS of each respondent that meets the condition. However, the output instructions say if the question asks for a list, provide a comma-separated list. So the answer would be all the GRS scores, but perhaps ordered as per the respondents. But the question doesn't specify to list the respondents' IDs, just the GRS. So the answer would be all the GRS values for those respondents. But the output should be the human-readable value. The GRS is a rubric score (0-3), so the answer would be the numbers. But according to the output rules, for MCQ fields, map codes to the corresponding text. Wait, the GRS (question 9) is a rubric with options 0-3, each corresponding to a description. The rubric for question 9 is:

9. Recommendation (global rating scale): Global Rating Scale (GRS) - How confident am I that I received an accurate picture of the patient? [Rubric: 0 = Not at all confident, 1 = Confident but required extended questioning, 2 = Confident but required some further questioning, 3 = Confident and required little or no questioning]

So each number corresponds to a text. Therefore, the answer should be the text, not the number. So for each GRS value, we need to map it to the corresponding rubric.

So for example, GRS=2 corresponds to ""Confident but required some further questioning"".

So the respondents with sum 5 are:

Respondent 18: GRS=2 → ""Confident but required some further questioning""

Respondent 12: GRS=3 → ""Confident and required little or no questioning""

Respondent 19: GRS=3 → same as above

Respondent 23: GRS=3 → same

Respondent 14: GRS=2 → same as first

Respondent 1: GRS=2 → same as first

So the answer would be a list of these text values. But the output rules state that for MCQ fields, output the corresponding text. So each GRS value is mapped to its rubric text. Therefore, the answer would be multiple entries. However, the output rules say if the question asks for a list, provide a comma-separated list. So the answer would be:

""Confident but required some further questioning, Confident and required little or no questioning, Confident and required little or no questioning, Confident and required little or no questioning, Confident but required some further questioning, Confident but required some further questioning""

But that's quite long. However, the user might have intended that there's only one respondent, but according to the data, there are multiple. But perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I misread the data. Let me check each respondent again:

Respondent 18: Background (examination) is 2, Assessment is 3. Sum 5. GRS is 2 → ""Confident but required some further questioning"".

Respondent 12: Background (examination) 3, Assessment 2. Sum 5. GRS 3 → ""Confident and required little or no questioning"".

Respondent 19: Background (examination) 3, Assessment 2. Sum 5. GRS 3 → same as above.

Respondent 23: Background (examination) 2, Assessment 3. Sum 5. GRS 3 → same.

Respondent 14: Background (examination) 2, Assessment 3. Sum 5. GRS 2 → same as first.

Respondent 1: Background (examination) 2, Assessment 3. Sum 5. GRS 2 → same.

So the answer is multiple entries. But the output rules say to provide a simple comma-separated list. So the answer would be all the GRS texts for these respondents. However, the user might have intended a different approach. Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the data. For example, perhaps the user intended that only one respondent meets the criteria. Let me check again.

Wait, looking at the data provided, perhaps there's a typo in the session names. The task is to find the GRS for the respondent whose total for Background (examination) and Assessment is exactly 5. The answer would be all such respondents. But the example given in the problem had a single answer. However, in this case, there are multiple. Therefore, the correct answer is a list of the GRS texts for each of these respondents. But the output rules state that if the question asks for a list, provide a comma-separated list. So the answer would be:

Confident but required some further questioning, Confident and required little or no questioning, Confident and required little or no questioning, Confident and required little or no questioning, Confident but required some further questioning, Confident but required some further questioning

But that's a lot. However, perhaps the user made a mistake in the data entry. Let me check again. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck each respondent:

Respondent 18: Background (examination) = 2, Assessment =3 →5. GRS=2.

Respondent 12: Background (examination)=3, Assessment=2 →5. GRS=3.

Respondent 19: Background (examination)=3, Assessment=2 →5. GRS=3.

Respondent 23: Background (examination)=2, Assessment=3 →5. GRS=3.

Respondent 14: Background (examination)=2, Assessment=3 →5. GRS=2.

Respondent 1: Background (examination)=2, Assessment=3 →5. GRS=2.

Yes, that's correct. So there are six respondents. Therefore, the answer should list all their GRS texts. But the output rules say to provide a simple comma-separated list. However, the user might have intended a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the GRS score (the number) rather than the text. But according to the output rules, for MCQ fields, we need to map to the text. So the answer must be the text.

But the example given in the problem had a numerical answer (the example answer was ""2""), but that's because the question was about the Assessment, which is a rubric score. Wait, in the example, the answer was ""2"", which corresponds to the rubric for Assessment: ""Assessment after minimal questioning"". But the example's answer was given as ""2"", which is the numerical value, but according to the output rules, for MCQ fields, we should output the text. However, the example's answer was ""2"", which is the numerical value, not the text. This is conflicting. Wait, looking back at the example:

In the example, the question was ""What is the Assessment of the respondent from the 'II (Anaphylaxsis)' session on '2025-05-04'?"" The answer given was ""2"". The Assessment rubric is [0-3], and the answer was the numerical value. But according to the output rules, for MCQ fields, we should output the text. However, the example's answer is the numerical value, which contradicts the output rules. Therefore, perhaps in this case, the answer should be the numerical value, not the text. The output rules in the example might have been overridden. Let me check the output rules again.

The output rules state:

""For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.""

But in the example, the answer was ""2"", which is the numerical code, not the text. This suggests that perhaps the output should be the numerical value. But according to the output rules, it should be the text. This is conflicting. However, in the example, the answer was ""2"", which is the code. Therefore, perhaps the user expects the numerical value. But the output rules say to output the text. This is confusing. 

Alternatively, perhaps the rubric is considered a numerical scale, not an MCQ with options. For example, the rubric for Assessment is 0-3, but each number has a description. So when the question asks for the Assessment, the answer is the numerical value. But according to the output rules, if it's an MCQ, we should output the text. However, the example's answer was the numerical value. Therefore, there's inconsistency. 

Given this confusion, perhaps the intended answer is the numerical value. But according to the output rules, it should be the text. However, the example's answer was numerical. Therefore, perhaps the user expects the numerical value. 

In this case, the answer would be the numerical values of the GRS for the respondents with sum 5. So the answer would be 2,3,3,3,2,2. But the output rules say to provide a comma-separated list. So the answer would be ""2,3,",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Recommendation (global rating scale) of the respondent from the 'II-Anaphylaxsis' session whose Recommendation (global rating scale) is higher than the average Recommendation (global rating scale) for all sessions on '2025-03-14'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the Recommendation (global rating scale) for a respondent from the 'II-Anaphylaxsis' session on 2025-03-14 whose GRS is higher than the average GRS of all sessions on that date.

First, I need to identify all respondents from 2025-03-14. Let's look through the responses:

- Respondent 23: Date 2025-03-14, SessionName II-Anaphylaxsis, GRS 3
- Respondent 7: Date 2025-03-14, SessionName III-Sepsis, GRS 2
- Respondent 14: Date 2025-03-14, SessionName IV-Hypoglycemia, GRS 2
- Respondent 10: Date 2025-03-14, SessionName (MI)-VT, GRS 2

So there are four respondents on that date. Now, calculate the average GRS. The GRS values are 3, 2, 2, 2. Sum is 3+2+2+2=9. Average is 9/4 = 2.25.

Next, look for the respondent in the 'II-Anaphylaxsis' session on that date. That's Respondent 23 with GRS 3. Since 3 is higher than 2.25, we need their GRS. According to the rubric, GRS 3 corresponds to ""Confident and required little or no questioning.""

So the answer should be the text for GRS 3 from the schema.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Background (examination) of the respondent whose score for 'Background (examination)' was 1 and score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' was 3?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the Background (examination) score of a respondent who has a Background (examination) score of 1 and a Recommendation (clear recommendation) score of 3. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question is asking for the Background (examination) of the respondent who has a Background (examination) score of 1 and a Recommendation (clear recommendation) score of 3. Wait, no, the question says: ""What is the Background (examination) of the respondent whose score for 'Background (examination)' was 1 and score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' was 3?"" So, we need to find the respondent who has both a Background (examination) score of 1 and a Recommendation (clear recommendation) score of 3. Then, the answer would be the value of their Background (examination) field. But wait, the Background (examination) is a rubric-based score. Wait, looking at the data structure, the Background (examination) is a rubric score (0-3), and the question is asking for the actual value of that field, which is the numerical score. Wait, no. Wait, the question is phrased as ""What is the Background (examination) of the respondent..."". But in the data, the Background (examination) is a numerical score. Wait, but the output rules say that for MCQ fields, we need to map the code to the option text. Wait, but Background (examination) is a rubric-based score, which is a numerical value (0,1,2,3). The question's schema for Background (examination) is a rubric with 0-3, each corresponding to a description. So, the answer should be the textual description corresponding to the score of 1.

Wait, the user's task is to find the respondent who has a Background (examination) score of 1 and a Recommendation (clear recommendation) score of 3, and then report the Background (examination) value. But since the Background (examination) is a rubric, the answer should be the textual description for the score 1. Let me check the schema.

Looking at the Questions section:

6. Background (examination): Gives appropriate examination/observations. [Rubric: 0 = Observations are omitted or irrelevant, 1 = Observations reported but frequent clarification needed, 2 = Observations reported with few further questions needed, 3 = Comprehensive focused examination/observations]

So, the rubric for Background (examination) is:

0: Observations are omitted or irrelevant

1: Observations reported but frequent clarification needed

2: Observations reported with few further questions needed

3: Comprehensive focused examination/observations

So, if a respondent has a Background (examination) score of 1, the corresponding text is ""Observations reported but frequent clarification needed"".

Now, the task is to find which respondent has both Background (examination) = 1 and Recommendation (clear recommendation) = 3. Then, output the Background (examination) text for that respondent.

Looking through the responses:

Let's go through each respondent:

Respondent 8:

Background (examination): 2

Recommendation (clear recommendation): 2 → Doesn't match.

Respondent 6:

Background (examination): 3

Recommendation (clear recommendation): 2 → No.

Respondent 22:

Background (examination): 3

Recommendation (clear recommendation): 2 → No.

Respondent 14:

Background (examination): 2

Recommendation (clear recommendation): 1 → No.

Respondent 1:

Background (examination): 2

Recommendation (clear recommendation): 2 → No.

Respondent 21:

Background (examination): 1

Recommendation (clear recommendation): 3 → Yes! Here we go. So, this respondent has Background (examination) score 1 and Recommendation (clear recommendation) 3. Therefore, the Background (examination) text is ""Observations reported but frequent clarification needed"".

Wait, let me confirm:

Respondent 21's data:

Background (examination): 1

Recommendation (clear recommendation): 3

Yes. So the answer is the rubric text for Background (examination) score 1, which is ""Observations reported but frequent clarification needed"".

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Recommendation (global rating scale) of the respondent with the highest Identification in the 'I-VF' session?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the Recommendation (global rating scale) of the respondent with the highest Identification score in the 'I-VF' session.

First, I need to understand the data provided. The questions section defines each field, including the rubric for the Global Rating Scale (GRS) under question 9. The responses are from various respondents, each with their data entries.

The key points here are:
1. Identify the session named 'I-VF'.
2. Among respondents in that session, find the one with the highest Identification score.
3. For that respondent, report their Recommendation (global rating scale) value.

Looking at the responses, I need to filter for SessionName 'I-VF'. Scanning through the list, Respondent 13 has SessionName 'I-VF'. Let's check their details:

Respondent 13:
- SessionName: I-VF
- Identification: 3
- Recommendation (global rating scale): 2

Now, check if there are other respondents in the 'I-VF' session. From the data, only Respondent 13 has SessionName 'I-VF'. Their Identification score is 3, which is the highest possible (since the rubric for Identification goes up to 3). Since there's only one respondent in that session, they automatically have the highest Identification score.

Next, look at their Recommendation (global rating scale) value, which is 2. According to the rubric for question 9, a score of 2 corresponds to ""Confident but required some further questioning"".

So the answer should be the text corresponding to 2 in the GRS rubric, which is ""Confident but required some further questioning"".

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the Background (history) of the respondent whose score for 'Background (history)' was 2 and score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' was 2?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the Background (history) of the respondent who scored 2 in 'Background (history)' and 2 in 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)'. 

First, I need to look through each respondent's data to see which ones have both these scores. Let's go through each respondent one by one.

Starting with Respondent 12: Their Background (history) is 3 and Recommendation (clear recommendation) is 3. Doesn't match.

Respondent 10: Background (history) is 2 and Recommendation (clear recommendation) is 2. That's a match. But wait, the question is asking for the Background (history) value, which in this case is 2. But according to the data, the answer should be the actual text from the schema. Wait, no, the Background (history) is a rubric score, so the answer is the value, but the question is phrased as ""What is the Background (history) of the respondent..."". Wait, the Background (history) is a rubric score, so the answer is the score, but the user is asking for the value, which in the data is the numerical score. Wait, no, the question is asking for the Background (history) of the respondent. Wait, the 'Background (history)' field in the responses is a numerical score based on the rubric. The question is asking for the value of Background (history) for the respondent who has both scores as 2. Wait, no, the question is phrased as ""What is the Background (history) of the respondent..."", but the Background (history) in the data is a numerical score. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me re-read the task.

Wait, the task says: ""What is the Background (history) of the respondent whose score for 'Background (history)' was 2 and score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' was 2?"" So the answer is the value of Background (history) for that respondent. But since the respondent in question has a score of 2 in both, the Background (history) is 2. But according to the output rules, for MCQ fields, we need to map the code to the corresponding option text. Wait, but the Background (history) is a rubric with scores 0-3. The schema for Background (history) is a rubric with 0 to 3, each with a description. So the answer should be the text corresponding to the score 2. Let me check the schema.

Looking at the schema for question 5: Background (history): Gives appropriate history. [Rubric: 0 = History is unstructured or non-relevant, 1 = Relevant history but frequent clarification needed, 2 = Relevant history with few further questions needed, 3 = Comprehensive focused history]

So a score of 2 corresponds to ""Relevant history with few further questions needed"". Therefore, the answer should be that text. But the task is to find the respondent's Background (history) value, which is the text description of the score 2. So first, identify which respondents have both Background (history) = 2 and Recommendation (clear recommendation) = 2. Then, for those respondents, output the text corresponding to their Background (history) score.

Looking at the respondents:

Respondent 10: Background (history) 2, Recommendation (clear recommendation) 2. So this is a match. The Background (history) score is 2, which maps to ""Relevant history with few further questions needed"".

Respondent 7: Background (history) 2, Recommendation (clear recommendation) 2. Another match. So same mapping applies.

Respondent 13: Background (history) 2, but Recommendation (clear recommendation) is 2. Wait, no, Respondent 13's Background (history) is 2, and Recommendation (clear recommendation) is 2. So that's another match. Wait, let me check:

Looking at the data:

Respondent 10: Both scores 2 and 2.

Respondent 7: Background (history) 2, Recommendation (clear recommendation) 2.

Respondent 13: Background (history) 2, Recommendation (clear recommendation) 2.

Wait, no. Let me check each:

Respondent 10: Yes, both 2.

Respondent 7: Background (history) is 2, Recommendation (clear recommendation) is 2. So yes.

Respondent 13: Background (history) is 2, Recommendation (clear recommendation) is 2. So that's three respondents? Wait, let me check again.

Looking at the data:

Respondent 10:

Background (history): 2

Recommendation (clear recommendation): 2

Respondent 7:

Background (history): 2

Recommendation (clear recommendation): 2

Respondent 13:

Background (history): 2

Recommendation (clear recommendation): 2

Yes, all three have both scores as 2. So the answer would be the Background (history) text for each of them. But the question is asking for ""the respondent"", which might imply a single answer. Wait, but maybe there are multiple respondents. Let me check the data again.

Looking at the responses:

Respondent 10: Date 2025-03-14, Session (MI)-VT.

Background (history): 2

Recommendation (clear recommendation): 2

Respondent 7: Date 2025-03-14, Session III-Sepsis.

Background (history): 2

Recommendation (clear recommendation): 2

Respondent 13: Date 2025-03-14, Session I-VF.

Background (history): 2

Recommendation (clear recommendation): 2

So three respondents meet the criteria. But the question is phrased as ""the respondent"", which might be singular. However, the data shows three. But perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check again.

Wait, looking at the data:

Respondent 1: Background (history) 2, but Recommendation (clear recommendation) is 2. Wait, no, Respondent 1's Background (history) is 2, and Recommendation (clear recommendation) is 2. Wait, no, Respondent 1's data:

Respondent 1:

Background (history): 2

Recommendation (clear recommendation): 2

Yes, so that's another one. Wait, no, looking back:

Wait, Respondent 1's data:

Background (history): 2

Recommendation (clear recommendation): 2

Yes. So that's four respondents. Wait, no, let me check each:

Looking through all respondents:

Respondent 10: 2 and 2.

Respondent 7: 2 and 2.

Respondent 13: 2 and 2.

Respondent 1: Background (history) 2, Recommendation (clear recommendation) 2.

Wait, yes. So four respondents. But according to the data provided in the questionnaire section:

Wait, in the given data, let's list all:

Respondent 12: Bg hist 3, rec 3.

Respondent 10: Bg hist 2, rec 2.

Respondent 8: Bg hist 3, rec 2.

Respondent 21: Bg hist 3, rec 3.

Respondent 1: Bg hist 2, rec 2.

Respondent 7: Bg hist 2, rec 2.

Respondent 13: Bg hist 2, rec 2.

Respondent 11: Bg hist 3, rec 3.

Respondent 5: Bg hist 3, rec 2.

Respondent 14: Bg hist 2, rec 1.

Respondent 2: Bg hist 2, rec 2.

Wait, Respondent 2: Background (history) is 2, Recommendation (clear recommendation) is 2. So that's another one. So actually, the respondents with both scores 2 are:

Respondent 10, 7, 13, 1, 2. Wait, let me check each:

Respondent 10: Bg hist 2, rec 2. Yes.

Respondent 7: Bg hist 2, rec 2. Yes.

Respondent 13: Bg hist 2, rec 2. Yes.

Respondent 1: Bg hist 2, rec 2. Yes.

Respondent 2: Bg hist 2, rec 2. Yes.

Wait, but looking at the data:

Respondent 1's data:

Background (history): 2

Recommendation (clear recommendation): 2

Yes.

Respondent 2's data:

Background (history): 2

Recommendation (clear recommendation): 2

Yes.

So that's five respondents. But according to the data provided in the questionnaire, let's check:

Looking at the data again:

Respondent 1:

Background (history): 2

Recommendation (clear recommendation): 2

Yes.

Respondent 2:

Background (history): 2

Recommendation (clear recommendation): 2

Yes.

So total of five respondents meet the criteria. But the question is asking for the Background (history) of the respondent(s) with those scores. Since the answer requires the text corresponding to the score 2, which is ""Relevant history with few further questions needed"", and there are multiple respondents, the answer would be that text. However, the question is phrased as ""the respondent"", which might be singular, but according to the data, there are multiple. But perhaps the data in the example had a different answer. Wait, in the example given, the answer was ""2"", but that's because the question was about the Assessment score. But in this case, the answer is the text for the Background (history) score 2. So regardless of how many respondents meet the criteria, the answer is the text corresponding to the score 2. But the task is to find the Background (history) of the respondent(s) who have those two scores. So the answer is the text for the score 2, which is ""Relevant history with few further questions needed"". But the user might be expecting to list the actual respondents, but the question is phrased as ""What is the Background (history) of the respondent..."", which is the value of that field for the matching respondents. Since the field is a rubric score, the answer is the text description of the score 2. So even if multiple respondents have that score, the answer is the same for all. Therefore, the answer is ""Relevant history with few further questions needed"".

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the Recommendation (clear recommendation) of the respondent whose total score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and 'Situation' was exactly 4?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the Recommendation (clear recommendation) of the respondent whose total score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and 'Situation' adds up exactly to 4. 

First, I need to look through each respondent's data and check their scores for these two fields. The 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and 'Situation' scores need to sum to 4. Let me go through each respondent one by one.

Starting with Respondent 12: Their 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' is 3, and 'Situation' is 3. 3 + 3 = 6, which is more than 4. So not this one.

Respondent 21: 'Recommendation' is 3, 'Situation' is 2. 3 + 2 = 5. Still not 4.

Respondent 17: 'Recommendation' is 3, 'Situation' is 3. Sum is 6 again. Nope.

Respondent 13: 'Recommendation' is 2, 'Situation' is 3. 2 + 3 = 5. Not matching.

Respondent 18: 'Recommendation' is 2, 'Situation' is 3. 2 + 3 = 5. Still no.

Respondent 11: 'Recommendation' is 3, 'Situation' is 3. Sum is 6. Not the one.

Respondent 1: 'Recommendation' is 2, 'Situation' is 2. 2 + 2 = 4. Oh, this adds up to exactly 4. Wait, let me check again. The 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' here is 2, and 'Situation' is 2. Yes, 2 + 2 = 4. So this respondent meets the criteria. But wait, the question is asking for the 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' of that respondent. So for Respondent 1, the 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' is 2. But according to the rubric for that question, the options are 0-3. The question's output rules say to map the code to the corresponding text. Let me check the schema for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)': [Rubric: 0 = No recommendation, 1 = Clear recommendation only after extended questioning, 2 = Clear recommendation after minimal questioning, 3 = Clear comprehensive recommendation without questioning]. So a score of 2 corresponds to ""Clear recommendation after minimal questioning"". Therefore, the answer should be that text. 

Wait, but I need to make sure there are no other respondents with a sum of 4. Let me check the remaining ones. 

Respondent 4: 'Recommendation' is 2, 'Situation' is 3. 2 + 3 = 5. No.

Respondent 15: 'Recommendation' is 2, 'Situation' is 3. 5 again.

Respondent 5: 'Recommendation' is 2, 'Situation' is 3. 2 + 3 = 5. 

So the only respondent with a total of 4 is Respondent 1. Therefore, their 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' is 2, which maps to ""Clear recommendation after minimal questioning"".

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Background (examination) of the respondent whose score for 'Identification' was 3 and score for 'Background (history)' was 3?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the Background (examination) score for the respondent who has a score of 3 in both Identification and Background (history). 

First, I need to go through each respondent in the data and check their scores for Identification and Background (history). The questions section tells me that Identification is question 3 and Background (history) is question 5. Both are scored on a rubric from 0 to 3.

Looking at the responses:

- Respondent 4: Identification is 3, Background (history) is 3. Background (examination) is 2.
- Respondent 13: Identification 3, Background (history) 2. Doesn't meet both criteria.
- Respondent 19: Identification 3, Background (history) 3. Background (examination) is 3.
- Respondent 7: Identification 3, Background (history) 2. Doesn't meet.
- Respondent 9: Identification 3, Background (history) 2. No.
- Respondent 2: Identification 3, Background (history) 2. No.
- Respondent 14: Identification 3, Background (history) 2. No.
- Respondent 1: Identification -1, so no.
- Respondent 21: Identification 3, Background (history) 3. Background (examination) is 1.
- Respondent 22: Identification 3, Background (history) 3. Background (examination) 3.
- Respondent 15: Identification 3, Background (history) 2. No.
- Respondent 11: Identification 3, Background (history) 3. Background (examination) 3.

Wait, so multiple respondents have Identification 3 and Background (history) 3. Let's list them:

- Respondent 4: Exam score 2
- Respondent 19: Exam 3
- Respondent 21: Exam 1
- Respondent 22: Exam 3
- Respondent 11: Exam 3

But the question is asking for the Background (examination) of the respondent(s) with both scores 3. So there are multiple respondents here. However, the answer needs to be the value of Background (examination) for each such respondent. But the question is phrased as ""the respondent"", which might imply a single answer. Wait, maybe there's only one? Let me check again.

Wait, looking back:

Respondent 4: Identification 3, History 3, Exam 2.

Respondent 19: Identification 3, History 3, Exam 3.

Respondent 21: Identification 3, History 3, Exam 1.

Respondent 22: Identification 3, History 3, Exam 3.

Respondent 11: Identification 3, History 3, Exam 3.

So there are multiple respondents. But the question is asking for ""the respondent"", which might be a mistake, or perhaps there's only one. Wait, no, the data shows multiple. But the answer might need to list all of them. However, the output rules say if it's a list, provide a comma-separated list. But the question is phrased as ""the respondent"", which is singular. Hmm. Wait, let me check the exact question again.

The task is: ""What is the Background (examination) of the respondent whose score for 'Identification' was 3 and score for 'Background (history)' was 3?""

So ""the respondent"" implies singular, but there are multiple. However, in the data, there are multiple respondents meeting the criteria. So perhaps the answer is all their Background (examination) scores. But the output rules say if it's a list, provide a comma-separated list. Let me check the output rules again.

The output rules state: ""If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., '17, 21, 23')"". But here, the question is asking for the Background (examination) scores of those respondents. So if there are multiple, we need to list all their scores. But the example given in the output rules for a count is a number, and for a list, it's names or IDs. But here, the answer is the Background (examination) scores. So perhaps each of those respondents' scores. But the question is phrased as ""the respondent"", which is singular. Maybe there's a mistake in the data or the question. Let me check again.

Looking at the data:

Respondent 4: Identification 3, History 3, Exam 2.

Respondent 19: 3,3,3.

Respondent 21: 3,3,1.

Respondent 22: 3,3,3.

Respondent 11: 3,3,3.

So four respondents meet the criteria: 4,19,22,11 (but wait, Respondent 4's Background (history) is 3, yes. So their exam scores are 2,3,3,3,3. Wait, no:

Wait, Respondent 4: Background (history) is 3, yes. So their exam is 2.

Respondent 19: History 3, exam 3.

Respondent 21: History 3, exam 1.

Respondent 22: History 3, exam 3.

Respondent 11: History 3, exam 3.

So the Background (examination) scores are 2,3,1,3,3. Wait, but the question is asking for the Background (examination) of the respondent(s) with both scores 3. So all of them. But the answer would be multiple values. However, the output rules don't specify how to handle multiple answers unless it's a list. The example given in the output for a list is names or IDs. But here, the answer is the scores. So perhaps the answer is a list of the scores. But the output rules don't cover that. Alternatively, maybe the question expects all the scores, but the user might have intended a single answer. Let me check the data again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recheck each respondent:

Respondent 4: Identification 3, Background (history) 3. Background (examination) 2.

Respondent 19: Identification 3, Background (history) 3. Exam 3.

Respondent 21: Identification 3, Background (history) 3. Exam 1.

Respondent 22: Identification 3, Background (history) 3. Exam 3.

Respondent 11: Identification 3, Background (history) 3. Exam 3.

So the Background (examination) scores are 2,3,1,3,3. But the question is asking for ""the respondent"", which is singular. But there are multiple. However, perhaps the data has a typo, or maybe I'm missing something. Wait, maybe the question is looking for all respondents who meet the criteria and their exam scores. But the answer should be all the exam scores. However, the output rules don't specify. But the example given in the output for a list is for names or IDs. The question is about the Background (examination) score. So perhaps the answer is a list of the scores. But the output example for a count is a number, and for a list, it's names. But here, the answer is multiple numbers. How to present that?

Alternatively, maybe the question is intended to have a single answer, and perhaps there's only one respondent. But according to the data, there are multiple. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me list all respondents with Identification 3 and Background (history) 3:

- Respondent 4: Yes. Exam 2.

- Respondent 19: Yes. Exam 3.

- Respondent 21: Yes. Exam 1.

- Respondent 22: Yes. Exam 3.

- Respondent 11: Yes. Exam 3.

So five respondents. But the question is phrased as ""the respondent"", which is singular. This is conflicting. However, the data shows multiple. Therefore, the answer should list all their Background (examination) scores. But according to the output rules, if it's a list, provide a comma-separated list. But the example given is for names or IDs. The scores are numbers, so perhaps list them as 2,3,1,3,3. But the output rules don't specify. Alternatively, maybe the question expects all the scores, but the user might have intended a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in reading the data.

Wait, let me check each respondent again:

Respondent 4: Session III (Sepsis), Date 2025-05-16. Identification 3, Background (history) 3. Exam 2.

Respondent 19: Session I - MI, Date 2025-05-16. Identification 3, History 3, Exam 3.

Respondent 21: Session I (Myocardial infarction), Date 2025-05-16. Identification 3, History 3, Exam 1.

Respondent 22: Session IV (VT), Date 2025-05-16. Identification 3, History 3, Exam 3.

Respondent 11: Session IV (AF), Date 2025-04-04. Identification 3, History 3, Exam 3.

Yes, all these have Identification 3 and Background (history) 3. So their exam scores are 2,3,1,3,3. Therefore, the answer should be all these values. But the output rules don't specify how to handle multiple answers. However, the example given in the problem had a single answer (Answer: 2). So perhaps in this case, the answer is multiple values. But the user might expect all of them. However, the output format says to provide the human-readable value. If the question is asking for the Background (examination) of the respondents (plural?), but the task says ""the respondent"" (singular), which is conflicting. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question has a typo and should be plural. But given the data, there are multiple respondents. Therefore, the correct answer would be the list of their Background (examination) scores. But how to present that? The output rules say for a list, use comma-separated. So the answer would be ""2,3,1,3,3"". But the example in the problem had a single answer. Alternatively, maybe the user expects only the first one, but that's not logical. 

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check again. Wait, the question is asking for the Background (examination) of the respondent(s) with Identification 3 and Background (history) 3. So the answer is all the exam scores of those respondents. Therefore, the answer is 2,3,1,3,3. But the output example in the problem was a single number. However, the output rules state that if the question asks for a list, provide a comma-separated list. Since the question uses ""the respondent"" but there are multiple, perhaps the answer is all of them. Therefore, the answer is 2,3,1,3,3. But I need to check the data again to ensure I didn't miss any respondents.

Wait, Respondent 11: Background (history) is 3, Identification 3. Exam 3. Correct.

So the answer is the Background (examination) scores for these five respondents: 2,3,1,3,3. But the output rules don't specify how to handle multiple answers. However, the example in the problem had a single answer. Maybe the user intended for a single answer, but the data shows multiple. Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the data. But according to the given data, the answer should be all the exam scores. Therefore, the answer is 2,3,1,3,3. But I need to present them as per the output rules. Since the output rules for a list say to use a comma-separated list, the answer would be ""2, 3, 1, 3, 3"". However, the user might expect a different approach. Alternatively, maybe the question is intended to have a single answer, and perhaps I made a mistake in reading the data. Let me check once more.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the Background (examination) of the respondent (singular) who has both Identification 3 and Background (history) 3. But there are multiple. So the answer would be all of them. Therefore, the answer is 2,3,1,3,3. But the output example in the problem was a single number, but that's because in the example, there was only one respondent matching the criteria. In this case, there are multiple. So the answer should list all their exam scores. Therefore, the answer is 2,3,1,3,3.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Situation of the respondent whose score for 'Situation' was 3 and score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' was 3?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the Situation of the respondent who scored 3 in both 'Situation' and 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)'. 

First, I need to look through each respondent's data. Let me go through each one:

Starting with Respondent 12: Their Situation is 3, and Recommendation (clear recommendation) is 3. That matches both criteria. The Situation here is ""Identifies and prioritizes the main problem(s) unprompted"" according to the rubric. But the question is asking for the actual Situation value, which is an open-ended field. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the 'Situation' in the data is a rubric score, but the question is phrased as ""What is the Situation of the respondent..."". Wait, no, looking back at the data structure, the 'Situation' is a rubric-scored question. The actual question for 'Situation' is ""Identifies the main problem(s)."" The possible answers are 0 to 3 based on the rubric. But the user is asking for the 'Situation' of the respondent, which in the data is the value under the 'Situation' field. Wait, no, the 'Situation' in the responses is a numerical score. Wait, the question in the survey for 'Situation' is ""Identifies the main problem(s)."" The responses are numerical (0-3). But the task is to find the 'Situation' of the respondent. Wait, no, the user is asking for the 'Situation' value, which in the data is the numerical score. Wait, no, the question is phrased as ""What is the Situation of the respondent..."". Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me check the original task again.

The task says: ""What is the Situation of the respondent whose score for 'Situation' was 3 and score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' was 3?"" So, the user is looking for the 'Situation' value of the respondent(s) who have a score of 3 in both 'Situation' and 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)'. But in the data, the 'Situation' is a rubric score (0-3). Wait, but the 'Situation' field in the responses is a numerical value (like 3), which corresponds to the rubric. So the answer would be the rubric description for a score of 3 in the Situation question. But according to the output rules, for MCQ fields, we need to map the code to the option text. However, the Situation is a rubric-based score, not an MCQ with options A, B, C. Let me check the questions section again.

Looking at the Questions section:

3. Identification: [Rubric: 0 = ...]
4. Situation: [Rubric: 0 = ..., 3 = ...]
So each of these is a rubric with numerical scores. The output rules mention that for MCQ fields, map letter codes to option texts. But here, the responses are numerical, not letters. The output rules also state that for open-ended fields, output the exact text. However, the Situation in the responses is a numerical score (3), which corresponds to the rubric. But the user is asking for the 'Situation' of the respondent. Wait, perhaps the user is confused, but according to the data, the 'Situation' is a numerical score. But the actual answer should be the rubric description for that score. Wait, but the output rules say for MCQ fields, map codes to option texts. But in this case, the Situation is a rubric with numerical scores, not letters. So perhaps the answer is the text corresponding to the score 3 in the Situation rubric. Let me check the rubric for Situation:

Question 4. Situation: Identifies the main problem(s). [Rubric: 0 = Unable to identify the main problem(s), 1 = Identifies the main problem(s) after extended prompting, 2 = Identifies the main problem(s) with fewer prompts needed, 3 = Identifies and prioritizes the main problem(s) unprompted]

So a score of 3 in Situation corresponds to ""Identifies and prioritizes the main problem(s) unprompted"". But the user is asking for the 'Situation' of the respondent. Wait, but the 'Situation' field in the responses is the numerical score. However, the question is phrased as ""What is the Situation..."", which in the data is the numerical value. But the user might be expecting the textual description of the score. But according to the output rules, for MCQ fields, we need to map the code to the option text. But the Situation is a rubric with numerical codes, not letters. The output rules mention that for MCQ fields, map letter codes. But here, the codes are numerical. So perhaps the answer is the textual description of the score 3 for Situation. But the output rules state that for MCQ fields, map any letter codes. Since this is a numerical code, maybe it's not considered an MCQ. Alternatively, perhaps the user wants the actual numerical value, but the question is asking for the 'Situation' of the respondent. Wait, the question is phrased as ""What is the Situation of the respondent..."", which in the data is the numerical score. But the user might be confused. Wait, looking at the example provided in the initial example, the question was about the Assessment score for a specific session and date, and the answer was the numerical value (2). So in that case, the answer was the numerical score. So perhaps here, the answer is the numerical score. But the user is asking for the 'Situation' of the respondent, which in the data is the numerical value. But the example answer was ""2"", which is the numerical value. Wait, but in the example, the answer was the Assessment score (2) for the session on 2025-05-04. So in that case, the answer was the numerical value. So perhaps here, the answer is the numerical value of the Situation for the respondent(s) who have 3 in both Situation and Recommendation (clear recommendation). Wait, but the task is to find the Situation of the respondent(s) who have 3 in both. So first, find all respondents where Situation=3 and Recommendation (clear recommendation)=3. Then, for those respondents, what is their Situation value? But that's redundant because we already know their Situation is 3. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the question. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the actual content of the 'Situation' field, which in the data is a numerical score. But the example shows that when the question was about the Assessment, the answer was the numerical value (2). So following that, the answer here would be 3, but that's the same as the criteria. That can't be right. Wait, perhaps the user is asking for the 'Situation' field's value, which is 3, but that's the same as the condition. That seems redundant. Maybe the user intended to ask for the Comments or another field. Alternatively, perhaps there's a misunderstanding. Let me re-examine the task.

The task is: ""What is the Situation of the respondent whose score for 'Situation' was 3 and score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' was 3?""

Wait, perhaps the user is asking for the actual situation that the respondent identified, which would be an open-ended response. But looking at the data, the 'Situation' field is a rubric score, not an open-ended answer. The open-ended questions are Date, SessionName, and Comments. The other questions (3-9) are scored on rubrics. So the 'Situation' here is the numerical score. Therefore, the answer would be the rubric description corresponding to the score 3. But according to the output rules, for MCQ fields, map the code to the option text. However, the Situation is a rubric with numerical codes, not letters. The output rules mention letter codes, but here the codes are numerical. So perhaps the answer is the textual description of the rubric for score 3. But the example given in the initial example had the answer as ""2"", which is the numerical value. So perhaps the answer here is 3, but that's the same as the condition. That seems odd. Alternatively, maybe the user is asking for the SessionName or Date of the respondent, but the question is phrased as ""What is the Situation..."". Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the question. But given the data, the only possible answer is that the Situation is 3. But that's the same as the condition. Alternatively, maybe the user is asking for the Comments, but the question says 'Situation'. 

Wait, perhaps the user is confused between the rubric score and the actual problem identified. But in the data, the 'Situation' is a rubric score, not the actual problem. The actual problem would be part of the session's content, which isn't recorded in the data. The data only includes the scores for each category. Therefore, the answer is the rubric description for the Situation score of 3. But according to the output rules, for MCQ fields, we need to map the code to the option text. Since the Situation is a rubric with numerical codes, perhaps the answer is the text corresponding to 3. Let me check the output rules again. The output rules state: ""For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both."" But in this case, the codes are numerical, not letters. So perhaps the answer is the numerical value. But the example in the initial question had the answer as ""2"", which is the numerical value. So following that, the answer here would be 3. But that's the same as the condition. That seems redundant. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to ask for the SessionName or Date of the respondent, but the question is about the Situation. 

Wait, let's look at the data again. Which respondents have Situation=3 and Recommendation (clear recommendation)=3?

Looking through the responses:

Respondent 12: Situation=3, Recommendation (clear recommendation)=3. So this is one.

Respondent 11: Situation=3, Recommendation (clear recommendation)=3. Another one.

Respondent 17: Situation=3, Recommendation (clear recommendation)=3. Wait, no: Respondent 17's Recommendation (clear recommendation) is 3. Yes. So Respondent 17: Situation=3, Recommendation=3.

Respondent 19: Situation=3, Recommendation=3. Yes.

Wait, let's check each respondent:

Respondent 12: Situation 3, Rec 3. Yes.

Respondent 14: Situation 3, Rec 1. No.

Respondent 3: Situation 2, Rec 3. No.

Respondent 11: Situation 3, Rec 3. Yes.

Respondent 20: Situation 3, Rec 2. No.

Respondent 4: Situation 3, Rec 2. No.

Respondent 10: Situation 2, Rec 2. No.

Respondent 17: Situation 3, Rec 3. Yes.

Respondent 19: Situation 3, Rec 3. Yes.

Wait, no. Let me check each:

Respondent 12: SessionName II (Anaphylaxis), Date 2025-05-02. Situation=3, Rec (clear recommendation)=3.

Respondent 11: SessionName IV (AF), Date 2025-04-04. Situation=3, Rec=3.

Respondent 17: SessionName V (Hypoglycemia), Date 2025-05-04. Situation=3, Rec=3.

Respondent 19: SessionName I - MI, Date 2025-05-16. Situation=3, Rec=3.

So there are four respondents who meet the criteria. The question is asking for the 'Situation' of these respondents. But the 'Situation' in the data is the numerical score (3). However, the answer should be the textual description of the rubric for score 3. But according to the output rules, if it's an MCQ with letter codes, we map to text. But here, it's numerical. The example in the initial question had the answer as the numerical value (2). So perhaps the answer here is 3. But that's the same as the condition. That seems odd. Alternatively, maybe the user is asking for the SessionName or Date, but the question is about 'Situation'. 

Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the question. Alternatively, maybe the 'Situation' here refers to the actual problem identified, which isn't recorded in the data. The data only has the rubric scores. Therefore, the answer is the rubric description for Situation score 3. But according to the output rules, how should that be presented? The output rules say for MCQ fields, map letter codes to text. But this is a numerical code. The example answer was a numerical value. So perhaps the answer is 3. But that's the same as the condition. That can't be right. Alternatively, maybe the user is asking for the number of respondents, but the question is phrased as ""What is the Situation..."". 

Alternatively, perhaps the user is asking for the Comments of the respondents who meet the criteria. But the question specifically says 'Situation'. 

Given the confusion, perhaps the correct answer is the rubric description for Situation score 3. But according to the output rules, since it's not an MCQ with letters, but a numerical rubric, perhaps the answer is the numerical value. But in the example, the answer was the numerical value. So in this case, the answer would be 3. However, the respondents who meet the criteria have Situation=3, so the answer is 3. But that's the same as the condition. That seems redundant. 

Wait, perhaps the user intended to ask for the SessionName or Date of the respondent(s) with those scores, but the question is phrased as 'Situation'. Alternatively, maybe the user is asking for the number of such respondents. Let me check the task again: ""What is the Situation of the respondent whose score for 'Situation' was 3 and score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' was 3?"" So the answer should be the Situation value(s) of those respondents. But their Situation is 3. So the answer is 3. But that's the same as the condition. That seems odd. Alternatively, perhaps the user is asking for the textual description of the Situation score 3. 

Given the example in the initial question, when asked about the Assessment, the answer was the numerical value (2). So following that, the answer here would be 3. But that's the same as the condition. That can't be right. Therefore, perhaps the user made a mistake in the question. Alternatively, maybe the answer is the list of respondents' IDs. But the question asks for the Situation, not the IDs. 

Alternatively, perhaps the user is asking for the Comments of those respondents. But the question says 'Situation'. 

Given the data and the example, the answer is 3. But that's the same as the condition. However, in the example, the answer was 2, which was the Assessment score. So following that, the answer here is 3. But that's the same as the condition. Therefore, the answer is 3. But that seems redundant. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to ask for the number of respondents, which would be 4 (Respondents 12, 11, 17, 19). But the question is phrased as ""What is the Situation..."", not ""How many..."". 

Given the ambiguity, but following the example's structure, the answer is the numerical value of the Situation, which is 3. But since the question is asking for the Situation of the respondents who have 3 in both, the answer is 3. However, that's the same as the condition. Therefore, perhaps the user made a mistake in the question. Alternatively, maybe the answer is the SessionName or Date. But the question is about Situation. 

Alternatively, perhaps the user is asking for the Comments, but the question says 'Situation'. 

Given the data and the example, the answer is 3. But that's the same as the condition. Therefore, I think the answer is 3. However, in the example, the answer was 2, which was the Assessment score. So following that, the answer here is 3. But that's the same as the condition. Therefore, the answer is 3.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Recommendation (global rating scale) of the respondent from the 'II - Anaphylaxsis' session whose Background (history) is higher than the average Background (history) for all sessions on '2025-05-04'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the Recommendation (global rating scale) for a specific respondent. The criteria are: the session name is 'II - Anaphylaxsis', the date is '2025-05-04', and the respondent's Background (history) score is higher than the average Background (history) for all sessions on that date.

First, I need to identify all respondents from 2025-05-04. Let's look through the data:

- Respondent 18: Date 2025-05-04, SessionName IV - VT
- Respondent 5: Date 2025-05-04, SessionName II - Anaphylaxsis
- Any others? Checking the list, the other respondents have dates in March, April, or May 16th. So only these two on May 4th.

Next, calculate the average Background (history) score for all sessions on 2025-05-04. The two respondents on that date are Respondent 18 and Respondent 5.

Respondent 18's Background (history) is 2.
Respondent 5's Background (history) is 3.

Average = (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5.

Now, the question asks for the respondent in the 'II - Anaphylaxsis' session on that date whose Background (history) is higher than the average (2.5). 

Looking at Respondent 5: their Background (history) is 3, which is higher than 2.5. So this is the correct respondent.

Now, check their Recommendation (global rating scale). Respondent 5's GRS is 3. According to the rubric for Question 9, 3 means ""Confident and required little or no questioning"".

So the answer should be the value corresponding to 3 in the GRS rubric, which is ""Confident and required little or no questioning"".

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Recommendation (clear recommendation) of the respondent from the 'IV (VT)' session whose Situation is higher than the average Situation for all sessions on '2025-05-02'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the Recommendation (clear recommendation) for a specific respondent. The criteria are: the session name is 'IV (VT)', the date is '2025-05-02', and their Situation score is higher than the average Situation score of all sessions on that date.

First, I need to identify all respondents from 2025-05-02. Let's look through the responses. 

Looking at the data:

- Respondent 1: Date 2025-05-02, SessionName V (Hypoglycemia), Situation 2
- Respondent 20: Date 2025-05-02, SessionName IV (VT), Situation 3
- Respondent 16: Date 2025-05-02, SessionName I - MI, Situation 3

So there are three respondents on that date. Now, calculate the average Situation score. The scores are 2, 3, and 3. Adding them: 2 + 3 + 3 = 8. Divided by 3, the average is 8/3 ≈ 2.67.

Next, find the respondent in 'IV (VT)' on 2025-05-02. That's Respondent 20. Their Situation score is 3, which is higher than 2.67. 

Now, check their Recommendation (clear recommendation). Respondent 20 has a score of 2. According to the questions schema, the rubric for Recommendation (clear recommendation) is:
0 = No recommendation
1 = Clear recommendation only after extended questioning
2 = Clear recommendation after minimal questioning
3 = Clear comprehensive recommendation without questioning

So a score of 2 maps to ""Clear recommendation after minimal questioning"". That's the answer.
</think>

Clear recommendation after minimal questioning",True
