</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Identification of the respondent from the 'III-Sepsis' session on '2025-03-14'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the Identification score of the respondent who attended the 'III-Sepsis' session on '2025-03-14'. 

First, I need to look through the responses section to find the respondent with the matching SessionName and Date. The SessionName is 'III-Sepsis' and the Date is '2025-03-14'. 

Looking at the list of respondents:

- Respondent19: Date is 2025-05-16, SessionName is ""I - MI"" – not a match.
- Respondent14: Date 2025-03-14, SessionName ""IV-Hypoglycemia"" – date matches, but session name doesn't.
- Respondent2: Date 2025-04-04, SessionName ""MI"" – nope.
- Respondent1: Date 2025-05-02, SessionName ""V (Hypoglycemia)"" – not matching.
- Respondent3: Date 2025-04-04, SessionName ""III-Sepsis"" – session matches, but date is April 4th, not March 14th.
- Respondent7: Date 2025-03-14, SessionName ""III-Sepsis"" – both date and session name match. 

So Respondent7 is the one we need. Now, check their Identification score. In the data, Respondent7 has pred:Identification ""3"". 

The question is about the Identification, which according to the questions schema is a rubric where 3 means ""Introduces themselves and information is complete"". 

So the answer should be the value corresponding to 3, which is the text from the rubric. The output should be the human-readable text, not the number. Therefore, the answer is ""Introduces themselves and information is complete"".

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Background (history) of respondent '14'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question. The task is to find the Background (history) of respondent 14. First, I need to look at the data provided.

Looking at the responses section, I need to find the entry for :Respondent14. Let me scan through each respondent. Here's :Respondent17, 20, 1, 18, 7, 22, 14... there we go. 

For :Respondent14, the predicate for background history is pred:Background_history ""2"". Now, I need to check the questions schema to understand what ""2"" means for the Background_history question. 

The question QBackground_history has the rubric: 0 = History is unstructured or non-relevant, 1 = Relevant history but frequent clarification needed, 2 = Relevant history with few further questions needed, 3 = Comprehensive focused history. 

So, a score of 2 corresponds to ""Relevant history with few further questions needed"". The answer should be this exact text from the rubric. I need to make sure not to include any codes or numbers, just the text as per the output rules. 

Double-checking that there's no confusion with other respondents or fields. Respondent14's Background_history is definitely ""2"", which maps to the correct rubric description. No other possible interpretations here. The answer is straightforward once the schema is correctly referenced.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Background (history) of the respondent from the 'I - MI' session on '2025-05-16'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the Background (history) of the respondent from the 'I - MI' session on '2025-05-16'. 

First, I need to look at the data provided. The data is in RDF format with prefixes and predicates. The responses are listed under different respondents like :Respondent19, :Respondent9, etc. Each respondent has various predicates such as pred:Date, pred:SessionName, and others.

The question is asking for the Background_history, which corresponds to the pred:Background_history predicate in the data. The value here is a rubric score. According to the questions section, the rubric for QBackground_history is: 
""Gives appropriate history. [Rubric: 0 = History is unstructured or non-relevant, 1 = Relevant history but frequent clarification needed, 2 = Relevant history with few further questions needed, 3 = Comprehensive focused history]"".

So, I need to find the respondent who has pred:Date ""2025-05-16"" and pred:SessionName ""I - MI"". 

Looking through the responses, :Respondent19 has pred:Date ""2025-05-16"" and pred:SessionName ""I - MI"". The pred:Background_history for this respondent is ""3"". 

According to the rubric, a score of 3 means ""Comprehensive focused history"". Therefore, the answer should be ""Comprehensive focused history"".

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Situation of respondent '11'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the ""Situation"" of respondent 11. First, I need to understand what ""Situation"" refers to in the data provided.

Looking at the questions section, there's a predicate called :QSituation with the text ""Identifies the main problem(s). [Rubric: 0 = Unable to identify the main problem(s), 1 = Identifies the main problem(s) after extended prompting, 2 = Identifies the main problem(s) with fewer prompts needed, 3 = Identifies and prioritizes the main problem(s) unprompted]"". So, the Situation score is a rubric-based assessment where each number corresponds to a specific level of performance.

Now, I need to find the response data for respondent 11. Scrolling through the responses, I see :Respondent11. Let's check their pred:Situation value. The entry shows ""pred:Situation ""3"""". 

According to the rubric, a score of 3 means ""Identifies and prioritizes the main problem(s) unprompted"". The output rules specify that for MCQ fields, I should map the code to the corresponding text from the schema and output only that text. So, the answer should be the text associated with 3 in the Situation rubric.

I should double-check to make sure there's no confusion with other respondents or data points. Respondent11's entry is correct, and the Situation is indeed 3. There's no ambiguity here. The answer is straightforward based on the provided data.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Background (examination) of respondent '13'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the Background (examination) of respondent 13. 

First, I need to look at the data provided. The user mentioned that there's a 'questions' section and a 'responses' section. The 'questions' define what each field means, and the 'responses' have the actual data for each respondent.

Looking at the 'questions' section, I see that :QBackground_examination is defined as ""Gives appropriate examination/observations. [Rubric: 0 = Observations are omitted or irrelevant, 1 = Observations reported but frequent clarification needed, 2 = Observations reported with few further questions needed, 3 = Comprehensive focused examination/observations]"". So, the possible values are 0, 1, 2, or 3, each corresponding to a specific description.

Now, I need to find respondent 13 in the 'responses' section. Scrolling through the responses, I see :Respondent13. Let's check their details. 

For :Respondent13, the pred:Background_examination is ""1"". According to the rubric in the question schema, a value of 1 means ""Observations reported but frequent clarification needed"". 

So, the answer should be the text corresponding to the value 1 for the Background_examination question. The output should be the description, not the number. Therefore, the answer is ""Observations reported but frequent clarification needed"".

<task>
What is the Assessment of respondent '23'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the Assessment of respondent '23' based on the provided data. 

First, I need to locate respondent 23 in the responses section. Looking through the data, I see there's a :Respondent23 entry. Let me check the details there.

Under :Respondent23, the pred:Assessment is listed as ""3"". Now, I need to refer back to the questions schema to understand what this value corresponds to. 

The question QAssessment has the rubric: ""Makes logical assessment (correlates problem, history, exam, context). [Rubric: 0 = No logical assessment, 1 = Assessment only after extended questioning, 2 = Assessment after minimal questioning, 3 = Comprehensive logical assessment without questioning]"".

Since the response is ""3"", the corresponding assessment should be ""Comprehensive logical assessment without questioning"". 

I should verify that there are no other entries for respondent 23 that might have different values, but looking at the data, it's clear that :Respondent23's Assessment is indeed ""3"". 

Therefore, the answer should be the text associated with the rubric score 3 for QAssessment.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Recommendation (global rating scale) of the respondent from the 'MI' session on '2025-04-04'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the Recommendation (global rating scale) for the respondent from the 'MI' session on '2025-04-04'. 

First, I need to look at the data provided. The dataset has a list of respondents with various details. Each respondent has a Date, SessionName, and several other attributes. The question is about the 'Recommendation_global_rating_scale' for a specific session.

Looking at the 'Questions' section, the 'QRecommendation_global_rating_scale' is defined with a rubric from 0 to 3. The output should be the text corresponding to the numerical value in the response. The user mentioned that for MCQ fields, we need to map the code to the option text. However, in this case, the responses are numerical, so each number corresponds to a specific rubric level.

Now, I need to find the respondent who has the SessionName 'MI' and Date '2025-04-04'. Scanning through the responses:

- :Respondent2 has pred:Date ""2025-04-04"" and pred:SessionName ""MI"". Checking their pred:Recommendation_global_rating_scale, it's ""1"". 

According to the rubric for QRecommendation_global_rating_scale, 1 corresponds to ""Confident but required extended questioning"". The output should be this exact text, not the number. 

I need to make sure there are no other respondents with the same date and session name. Checking all other entries, the other respondents have different SessionNames or dates. So Respondent2 is the correct one. The answer is the text associated with the value ""1"" from the rubric.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Recommendation (global rating scale) of respondent '9'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the Recommendation (global rating scale) of respondent 9. 

First, I need to look at the data provided. The dataset has a 'questions' section and a 'responses' section. The questions define what each predicate means, and the responses have the actual data for each respondent.

Looking at the 'Recommendation_global_rating_scale' in the questions, the rubric is: 0 = Not at all confident, 1 = Confident but required extended questioning, 2 = Confident but required some further questioning, 3 = Confident and required little or no questioning. So each number corresponds to a specific text.

Now, I need to find respondent 9 in the responses. Scrolling through the responses, I see :Respondent9 with pred:Recommendation_global_rating_scale ""2"". 

According to the rubric, ""2"" maps to ""Confident but required some further questioning"". The output should be the text, not the number. So the answer is ""Confident but required some further questioning"".

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Background (examination) of the respondent from the 'II - Anaphylaxsis' session on '2025-05-04'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the Background (examination) of the respondent from the 'II - Anaphylaxsis' session on '2025-05-04'. 

First, I need to look at the data provided. The data is in RDF format, with prefixes and a list of respondents. Each respondent has various predicates like pred:Date, pred:SessionName, and others.

The key here is to filter the respondents based on two criteria: the date and the session name. The date we're looking for is '2025-05-04', and the session name is 'II - Anaphylaxsis'. Wait, looking at the responses, I notice that session names might have variations. For example, in the data, there's a Respondent5 with SessionName ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" and Respondent9 with ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"". The hyphen versus parentheses might be a typo, but the user specified 'II - Anaphylaxsis' with a hyphen, so I should look for that exact string.

Looking through the respondents:

- Respondent5 has pred:Date ""2025-05-04"" and pred:SessionName ""II - Anaphylaxsis"".
- Respondent9 has the same date but the session name is ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"".

So Respondent5 is the one matching the exact session name as per the task. Now, the question is about the Background_examination. The predicate for that is pred:Background_examination. 

Checking Respondent5's data: pred:Background_examination ""3"". 

Now, referring back to the questions section, the QBackground_examination has the rubric. The rubric states that a score of 3 means ""Comprehensive focused examination/observations"". 

So the answer should be the text corresponding to the score 3 for Background_examination, which is ""Comprehensive focused examination/observations"".

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Assessment of the respondent from the 'IV (AF)' session on '2025-04-04'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the Assessment of the respondent from the 'IV (AF)' session on '2025-04-04'. 

First, I need to look through the responses section to find the respondent who has the Date ""2025-04-04"" and SessionName ""IV (AF)"". 

Looking at the data, there's a :Respondent11 with pred:Date ""2025-04-04"" and pred:SessionName ""IV (AF)"". That matches the date and session name specified. 

Next, I need to check the Assessment value for this respondent. The Assessment is under the predicate pred:Assessment. For :Respondent11, the value is ""3"". 

Now, referring back to the questions section, the QAssessment question has a rubric where 3 means ""Comprehensive logical assessment without questioning"". 

So, the answer should be the text corresponding to the rubric score 3 for the Assessment question.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Assessment of the respondent from the 'I (Myocardial infarction)' session on '2025-05-16'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the Assessment of the respondent from the 'I (Myocardial infarction)' session on '2025-05-16'. 

First, I need to look through the responses provided. The data is in RDF format, with each respondent as a :Person and various predicates indicating their answers. 

I'll start by filtering the respondents based on the date and session name. The date given is '2025-05-16', and the session name is 'I (Myocardial infarction)'. 

Looking at the responses, I see that :Respondent21 has pred:Date ""2025-05-16"" and pred:SessionName ""I (Myocardial infarction)"". That's the one we need. 

Next, I need to find the Assessment value for this respondent. The Assessment corresponds to the predicate pred:Assessment. Checking :Respondent21's data, the pred:Assessment is ""2"". 

Now, referring back to the questions section, the QAssessment question's rubric explains the scoring. A score of 2 means ""Assessment after minimal questioning"". 

So, the answer should be the text corresponding to the rubric value 2 for the Assessment question.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Identification of respondent '15'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the Identification of respondent 15. 

First, I need to look at the data provided. The responses are listed with each respondent having various predicates. The Identification is one of those predicates.

Looking through the respondents, I need to find the one with the identifier :Respondent15. Let me check each entry. 

Here's :Respondent15's data:

:Respondent15 a :Person ;
    pred:Date ""2025-05-04"" ;
    pred:SessionName ""III - Sepsis"" ;
    pred:Identification ""3"" ;
    pred:Situation ""3"" ;
    pred:Background_history ""2"" ;
    pred:Background_examination ""3"" ;
    pred:Assessment ""2"" ;
    pred:Recommendation_clear_recommendation ""2"" ;
    pred:Recommendation_global_rating_scale ""2"" ;
    pred:Comments ""Detailed Response - clear communication"" .

So, the pred:Identification for Respondent15 is ""3"". 

Now, checking the question schema for the Identification question. The question is:

:QIdentification pred:Text ""Identification of self, role, and patient. [Rubric: 0 = Requires direct prompting, 1 = Introduces themselves but only after a hint, 2 = Introduces themselves but information is incomplete, 3 = Introduces themselves and information is complete]"" .

The rubric says that a score of 3 corresponds to ""Introduces themselves and information is complete"". 

Therefore, the answer should be the text corresponding to the value ""3"" from the rubric, which is ""Introduces themselves and information is complete"".
</think>

Introduces themselves and information is complete",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Background (history) of the respondent from the '(MI)-VT' session on '2025-03-14'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the Background (history) of the respondent from the '(MI)-VT' session on '2025-03-14'. 

First, I need to understand the structure of the data provided. The data includes a list of respondents with various properties like Date, SessionName, and several assessment scores. The question is asking specifically about the ""Background (history)"", which corresponds to the QBackground_history predicate in the questions section. The rubric for this question is a scale from 0 to 3, with descriptions for each score.

Looking at the responses, I need to find the respondent who has the SessionName ""(MI)-VT"" and the Date ""2025-03-14"". Let me scan through each respondent entry.

Starting with :Respondent10, the data shows:
- pred:Date ""2025-03-14""
- pred:SessionName ""(MI)-VT""
- pred:Background_history ""2""

That's the one we need. The Background_history here is ""2"". According to the QBackground_history question's rubric, a score of 2 means ""Relevant history with few further questions needed"". 

I should verify that there are no other respondents with the same SessionName and Date. Checking others, like Respondent23 and Respondent7, their SessionNames are different. Respondent10 is the only one matching both criteria. 

So the answer should be the text corresponding to the score 2 in the rubric for QBackground_history, which is ""Relevant history with few further questions needed"".

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the Situation of the respondent from the 'IV (VT)' session on '2025-05-02'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the ""Situation"" of the respondent from the 'IV (VT)' session on '2025-05-02'. 

First, I need to look at the data provided. The data includes several respondents with various dates and session names. The key here is to filter the responses based on the given date and session name.

Looking at the date first: '2025-05-02'. I'll scan through each respondent's data to see who has this date. The respondents with this date are Respondent1, Respondent20, and Respondent16. 

Next, the session name is 'IV (VT)'. Let's check each of the respondents from 2025-05-02. 

Respondent1's session is ""V (Hypoglycemia)"", so that's not a match. Respondent20's session is ""IV (VT)"", which matches exactly. Respondent16's session is ""I - MI"", so that's not relevant here. 

Now, focusing on Respondent20, I need to find the ""Situation"" score. The Situation question's rubric is about identifying the main problem(s), and the possible scores are 0 to 3. 

Looking at Respondent20's data, the pred:Situation is ""3"". According to the schema, a score of 3 means ""Identifies and prioritizes the main problem(s) unprompted"". 

So the answer should be the text corresponding to the score 3 for the Situation question. The output should be the text, not the number. Therefore, the answer is ""Identifies and prioritizes the main problem(s) unprompted"".

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Identification of respondent '18'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the Identification of respondent 18. 

First, I need to look at the data provided. The responses are listed with different respondents, each identified by a number like :Respondent18. I need to locate :Respondent18 in the data.

Looking through the responses, I see :Respondent18 has several predicates. The relevant one here is pred:Identification. The value for that is ""3"". 

Now, I need to refer back to the questions section to understand what ""3"" means for the Identification question. The question :QIdentification has the rubric where 3 corresponds to ""Introduces themselves and information is complete"". 

So, the answer should be the text associated with the score 3, which is the complete introduction. I need to make sure there's no confusion with other respondents or different scores. Since the output rules specify to provide the human-readable value, I just state that text without the code.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Recommendation (global rating scale) of the respondent from the 'IV (VT)' session on '2025-05-02'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the Recommendation (global rating scale) for the respondent from the 'IV (VT)' session on '2025-05-02'. 

First, I need to look at the data provided. The responses are listed with various respondents, each having different dates, session names, and scores. The key here is to filter the correct respondent based on the date and session name.

Looking at the date first: the question specifies '2025-05-02'. Scanning through the responses, I see that Respondent20 has a date of ""2025-05-02"". Now, check the session name for Respondent20. The session name is ""IV (VT)"", which matches the question's 'IV (VT)' exactly. 

Next, I need to find the Recommendation (global rating scale). The corresponding predicate for the global rating scale is pred:Recommendation_global_rating_scale. Checking Respondent20's data, the value for this predicate is ""3"". 

Now, referring back to the questions schema for QRecommendation_global_rating_scale, the rubric states that 3 corresponds to ""Confident and required little or no questioning"". Since the output should be the human-readable text and not the code, the answer is this text.
</think>

Answer: Confident and required little or no questioning",True

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Background (history) of respondent '8'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the Background (history) of respondent 8. 

First, I need to look at the data provided. The user mentioned the 'questions' and 'responses' sections. The 'questions' define what each field means, and the 'responses' have the actual data for each respondent.

Looking at the questions, there's a :QBackground_history with the text ""Gives appropriate history. [Rubric: 0 = ... 3 = Comprehensive focused history]"". So the Background_history is a rubric-based score from 0 to 3. 

Now, checking the responses for respondent8. The data for :Respondent8 shows pred:Background_history ""2"". According to the rubric for QBackground_history, a score of 2 means ""Relevant history with few further questions needed"". 

I need to make sure there's no confusion with other respondents. Let me double-check that I'm looking at the right respondent. Yes, :Respondent8 has pred:Background_history ""2"". 

The output rules state that for MCQ fields, I should map the code to the corresponding text from the schema. So ""2"" here translates to ""Relevant history with few further questions needed"". 

No other processing is needed. The answer is straightforward once the correct respondent and the corresponding rubric are identified.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Recommendation (clear recommendation) of respondent '5'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question. The task is to find the ""Recommendation (clear recommendation)"" for respondent 5. 

First, I need to look at the data provided. The user mentioned that the data includes both questions and responses. The questions define the schema, and the responses are the actual data entries for each respondent.

Looking at the responses section, I need to find the entry for Respondent5. Let me scan through the list. Here's Respondent5:

:Respondent5 a :Person ;
    pred:Date ""2025-05-04"" ;
    pred:SessionName ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" ;
    pred:Identification ""3"" ;
    pred:Situation ""3"" ;
    pred:Background_history ""3"" ;
    pred:Background_examination ""3"" ;
    pred:Assessment ""3"" ;
    pred:Recommendation_clear_recommendation ""2"" ;
    pred:Recommendation_global_rating_scale ""3"" ;
    pred:Comments ""Good clear and precise clinical handover
Good""  .

So, the pred:Recommendation_clear_recommendation is ""2"". 

Now, I need to refer back to the questions schema to understand what ""2"" means for this specific question. The question for Recommendation_clear_recommendation is:

:QRecommendation_clear_recommendation pred:Text ""Makes a clear recommendation. [Rubric: 0 = No recommendation, 1 = Clear recommendation only after extended questioning, 2 = Clear recommendation after minimal questioning, 3 = Clear comprehensive recommendation without questioning]"" .

According to the rubric, a score of 2 corresponds to ""Clear recommendation after minimal questioning"". 

The output rules state that for MCQ fields, I should map the code to the corresponding text from the schema and output only the text. So, the answer should be ""Clear recommendation after minimal questioning"".

I should double-check that there's no other respondent with the same ID or date that might be conflicting, but in this case, Respondent5 is clearly listed once with the correct data. The session name is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"", but the task is about the recommendation, which is correctly captured here. No other fields seem relevant here. The answer is definitely the text corresponding to ""2"" in the rubric.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Background (examination) of the respondent from the 'IV (AF)' session on '2025-04-04'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the Background (examination) of the respondent from the 'IV (AF)' session on '2025-04-04'. 

First, I need to look at the data provided. The data is in RDF format, with prefixes and predicates. The responses are listed under different respondents, each with a set of predicates like pred:Date, pred:SessionName, and various scores.

The question is asking for the Background_examination value. From the questions section, I see that :QBackground_examination has a rubric, but the answer needs to be the actual value from the response, which is a numerical score. However, according to the output rules, for MCQ fields, I need to map the code to the corresponding option text. Wait, but the Background_examination is a rubric-based score. Let me check the schema again.

Looking at the schema for :QBackground_examination, the rubric is:
0 = Observations are omitted or irrelevant
1 = Observations reported but frequent clarification needed
2 = Observations reported with few further questions needed
3 = Comprehensive focused examination/observations

So each numerical value corresponds to a textual description. The output rules state that for MCQ fields, map the code to the option text. Even though the response uses numbers, the schema defines them as rubric codes. Therefore, the answer should be the textual description corresponding to the numerical value in the response.

Now, I need to find the respondent who has pred:Date ""2025-04-04"" and pred:SessionName ""IV (AF)"". Let's check each respondent:

- Respondent2: Date 2025-04-04, SessionName ""MI"" → Not the one.
- Respondent13: Date 2025-03-14 → Wrong date.
- Respondent11: Date 2025-04-04, SessionName ""IV (AF)"" → This matches.
- Respondent4: Date 2025-05-16 → Wrong date.
- Respondent8: Date 2025-05-02 → Wrong date.
- Respondent7: Date 2025-03-14 → Wrong date.

So Respondent11 is the correct one. Now, check their pred:Background_examination. The value is ""3"". According to the rubric, 3 corresponds to ""Comprehensive focused examination/observations"".

Therefore, the answer should be ""Comprehensive focused examination/observations"".

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the Assessment of the respondent with the highest Recommendation (global rating scale) in the 'IV-Hypoglycemia' session?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the Assessment of the respondent with the highest Recommendation (global rating scale) in the 'IV-Hypoglycemia' session. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The data has a list of respondents, each with various attributes like Date, SessionName, Identification, Situation, Background_history, Assessment, Recommendation_global_rating_scale, etc. 

The question is specifically about the 'IV-Hypoglycemia' session. So I need to filter all respondents where the SessionName is 'IV-Hypoglycemia'. Looking at the responses, I see that Respondent14 has SessionName ""IV-Hypoglycemia"". The other respondents have different session names like ""IV - VT"", ""III - Sepsis"", etc. So Respondent14 is the only one in the IV-Hypoglycemia session.

Next, I need to check the Recommendation_global_rating_scale for this respondent. The value here is ""2"". But the question asks for the highest Recommendation (global rating scale) in that session. Since there's only one respondent in that session, the highest is 2. However, the question is about the Assessment of that respondent. 

Looking at Respondent14's data, the Assessment is ""3"". According to the questions schema, the Assessment question's rubric is: 0 = No logical assessment, 1 = Assessment only after extended questioning, 2 = Assessment after minimal questioning, 3 = Comprehensive logical assessment without questioning. So a value of 3 corresponds to ""Comprehensive logical assessment without questioning"".

Therefore, the answer should be ""Comprehensive logical assessment without questioning"".

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Background (history) of the respondent whose total score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and 'Assessment' was exactly 4?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the Background (history) of the respondent whose total score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and 'Assessment' is exactly 4. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The responses are given for various respondents, each with different dates, session names, and scores across multiple categories. The questions section defines each category, including 'QBackground_history' which corresponds to the ""Gives appropriate history"" rubric. The 'Recommendation_clear_recommendation' and 'Assessment' are the two scores we need to sum to 4.

Looking at each respondent:

- **Respondent8**: 
  - Assessment is 2, Recommendation_clear_recommendation is 2. Sum is 4. 
  - Background_history is 3. But according to the rubric for QBackground_history, a 3 means ""Comprehensive focused history"". So if this is the correct respondent, the answer would be ""Comprehensive focused history"".

- **Respondent6**: 
  - Assessment is 2, Recommendation_clear_recommendation is 2. Sum is 4. 
  - Background_history is 3. Same as above. But wait, the session name here is ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"". The question isn't about the session name, just the sum of the two scores. So this respondent also has a sum of 4. But the task is to find the one with the sum exactly 4. Wait, both Respondent8 and Respondent6 have sum 4. But the question is asking for the Background history of the respondent where the sum is exactly 4. So there might be multiple respondents. Let me check others.

- **Respondent14**: 
  - Assessment is 3, Recommendation_clear_recommendation is 1. Sum is 4. 
  - Background_history is 2. So sum is 4 here as well. So this is another respondent. Background history here is 2, which translates to ""Relevant history with few further questions needed"".

- **Respondent16**: 
  - Assessment is 3, Recommendation_clear_recommendation is 2. Sum is 5. So not 4.

- **Respondent20**: 
  - Assessment is 3, Recommendation_clear_recommendation is 2. Sum is 5. Not 4.

- **Respondent7**: 
  - Assessment is 2, Recommendation_clear_recommendation is 2. Sum is 4. 
  - Background_history is 2. So this is another one. 

Wait, so actually, there are three respondents with sum 4: Respondent8, Respondent6, Respondent14, and Respondent7. Wait, let me recount:

- Respondent8: 2 + 2 =4
- Respondent6: 2 +2=4
- Respondent14:3 +1=4
- Respondent7:2 +2=4

So four respondents? Wait, no. Let me check each:

Respondent8: Assessment=2, Recommendation_clear_recommendation=2 → 4. Yes.

Respondent6: same as above. 2+2=4.

Respondent14: 3+1=4.

Respondent7: 2+2=4.

So four respondents have a total of 4. But the question is asking for the Background history of the respondent(s) where the sum is exactly 4. So each of these respondents would have their Background history. But the question is phrased as ""the respondent"", which might imply a single one. But maybe there are multiple. However, the answer needs to be the Background history value for each of them. But let's check the data again.

Wait, the task says: ""the respondent whose total score..."". The use of ""the"" might suggest there's only one, but according to the data, there are multiple. Let me check again.

Looking at the data:

Respondent8: sum 4, Background_history=3 → ""Comprehensive focused history""

Respondent6: sum 4, Background_history=3 → same as above.

Respondent14: sum 4, Background_history=2 → ""Relevant history with few further questions needed""

Respondent7: sum 4, Background_history=2 → same as Respondent14.

So there are four respondents with sum 4. But the question is asking for ""the respondent"", which might be a mistake, or perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, maybe I miscalculated. Let me check each again.

Wait, Respondent6: Assessment=2, Recommendation_clear_recommendation=2 → 4. Correct.

Respondent8: same.

Respondent14: 3+1=4.

Respondent7: 2+2=4.

So four respondents. But the question is asking for the Background history of the respondent(s) with that sum. The answer would need to list all of them. However, the output rules state that if the question asks for a list, provide a comma-separated list. But the question is phrased as ""What is the Background..."", which might expect a single answer. But according to the data, there are multiple. 

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check each respondent again.

Wait, the task says ""the respondent whose total score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and 'Assessment' was exactly 4"". So all respondents with that sum. So the answer would be the Background history for each of them. But the output rules say, for example, if the question asks for a list, provide a comma-separated list. But the question is asking for the Background (history) of the respondents. So if there are multiple, we need to list all their Background history values.

But looking at the data:

- Respondent6: Background_history=3 → ""Comprehensive focused history""

- Respondent8: Background_history=3 → same.

- Respondent14: Background_history=2 → ""Relevant history with few further questions needed""

- Respondent7: Background_history=2 → same.

So the possible answers are ""Comprehensive focused history"" and ""Relevant history with few further questions needed"". But the output should be the exact values. However, the question might have intended a single answer, but according to the data, there are multiple. 

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check each respondent again.

Looking at the data:

Respondent6: pred:Assessment ""2"" ; pred:Recommendation_clear_recommendation ""2"" → sum 4.

Respondent8: same.

Respondent14: pred:Assessment ""3"" ; pred:Recommendation_clear_recommendation ""1"" → sum 4.

Respondent7: pred:Assessment ""2"" ; pred:Recommendation_clear_recommendation ""2"" → sum 4.

So four respondents. Therefore, the Background history for each would be:

Respondent6: 3 → ""Comprehensive focused history""

Respondent8: 3 → same.

Respondent14: 2 → ""Relevant history with few further questions needed""

Respondent7: 2 → same.

But the output rules state that if the question asks for a list, provide a comma-separated list. However, the question is phrased as ""What is the Background..."", which might expect multiple answers. But the output should be the human-readable value. So if there are multiple respondents, the answer would be a list of their Background history values. However, the example given in the output rules for a list is ""17, 21, 23"", which is a list of IDs. But here, the answer is text. So perhaps the answer should list all the distinct Background history values. But in the data, there are two different values: 3 and 2. So the answer would be ""Comprehensive focused history, Relevant history with few further questions needed"".

But wait, the output rules say: ""If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list"". The current question is asking for the Background (history) value(s), which are text. So perhaps each matching respondent's Background history should be listed. But the output must be the human-readable value. So if there are multiple, they should be listed. However, the example in the problem had a single answer (Answer: 2), but that was a different question. 

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake and there's only one respondent. Let me check again. Wait, perhaps the session name is a factor. Wait, the original question in the example was about the 'II (Anaphylaxsis)' session on '2025-05-04', but the current task doesn't mention session name or date. The current task is to find any respondent (regardless of session or date) where the sum of 'Recommendation_clear_recommendation' and 'Assessment' is exactly 4. So all respondents with that sum. 

Therefore, the answer should include all Background history values for those respondents. But how to present them? The output rules say to provide the human-readable value. If there are multiple, perhaps list them separated by commas. But the example in the output rules shows for a list of IDs, it's a comma-separated list. For text answers, perhaps each value is listed. 

But looking at the data, the possible Background_history values are 3 and 2. So the answer would be ""Comprehensive focused history, Relevant history with few further questions needed"". However, the problem is that each respondent's Background history is either 3 or 2, so the answer would include both. But the question is phrased as ""the respondent"", which is singular. This might be a mistake in the question, but according to the data, there are multiple respondents. 

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation. Let me check again:

- Respondent6: 2 (Assessment) + 2 (Recommendation) =4. Correct.

- Respondent8: 2+2=4. Correct.

- Respondent14:3+1=4. Correct.

- Respondent7:2+2=4. Correct.

So four respondents. Therefore, the answer should list all their Background history values. But according to the output rules, if the question asks for a list, provide a comma-separated list. However, the question is not explicitly asking for a list, but the answer may require multiple values. 

But the output rules also state: ""For open-ended fields, output the exact text value."" But in this case, the Background_history is a rubric-based score, so the answer is the text corresponding to the score. So for each respondent with sum 4, their Background_history is either 3 or 2. Therefore, the answer would be the text values for those scores. 

Looking at the QBackground_history question: 

""Gives appropriate history. [Rubric: 0 = History is unstructured or non-relevant, 1 = Relevant history but frequent clarification needed, 2 = Relevant history with few further questions needed, 3 = Comprehensive focused history]""

So:

- 3 → ""Comprehensive focused history""

- 2 → ""Relevant history with few further questions needed""

Therefore, the respondents with sum 4 have Background_history of 3 or 2. So the answer would be both of these texts. But how to present them? The output rules don't specify handling multiple answers unless it's a list. Since the question uses ""the respondent"" (singular), but there are multiple, perhaps the answer should list all applicable values. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the data. Let me check again. Wait, Respondent6's Background_history is 3, sum 4. Respondent8's is 3, sum 4. Respondent14's is 2, sum 4. Respondent7's is 2, sum 4. So four respondents, two with 3 and two with 2. Therefore, the answer would be both ""Comprehensive focused history"" and ""Relevant history with few further questions needed"". 

But the output rules say to provide the human-readable value. If there are multiple, perhaps list them separated by commas. So the answer would be ""Comprehensive focused history, Relevant history with few further questions needed"".

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Identification of the respondent whose score for 'Situation' was 3 and score for 'Assessment' was 3?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the Identification score of the respondent who has a Situation score of 3 and an Assessment score of 3. 

First, I need to look through all the respondents in the data provided. Each respondent has various scores for different categories. The key here is to filter out the respondents who have both Situation and Assessment scores equal to 3.

Starting with Respondent5: Their Situation is 3 and Assessment is 3. That's a match. Their Identification score is 3. But I should check others to make sure there aren't multiple respondents meeting the criteria.

Next, Respondent7: Situation is 3, but Assessment is 2. Doesn't fit.

Respondent10: Situation is 2, so skip.

Respondent22: Situation 3, Assessment 2. No.

Respondent2: Situation 3, Assessment 3. Another match. Their Identification is 3. Wait, so there are two respondents here? Let me check again.

Wait, the data for Respondent2 shows pred:Situation ""3"" and pred:Assessment ""3"". So they also meet the criteria. But the answer in the example was 2, but that was for a different question. Wait, no, the example was a different question. Let me focus on the current task.

Wait, the current task is to find the Identification score where Situation is 3 and Assessment is 3. So both Respondent5 and Respondent2 have Situation 3 and Assessment 3. But looking at their Identification scores: both have 3. Wait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me check all respondents again.

Respondent18: Situation 3, Assessment 3. Their Identification is 3. So that's a third one. Wait, no, Respondent18's Assessment is 3? Let me check. Yes, pred:Assessment ""3"". So that's another match. So three respondents: 5, 2, 18. All have Identification 3. But the answer would be 3. But wait, the example answer was 2, but that was for a different question. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, let me list all respondents with Situation=3 and Assessment=3:

- Respondent5: Situation 3, Assessment 3 → Identification 3
- Respondent2: Situation 3, Assessment 3 → Identification 3
- Respondent18: Situation 3, Assessment 3 → Identification 3
- Respondent11: Situation 3, Assessment 3 → Identification 3
Wait, checking Respondent11: pred:Situation ""3"", pred:Assessment ""3"". Yes. So Identification is 3.

Wait, so there are four respondents here. But the question is asking for the Identification of the respondent(s) who meet the criteria. If there are multiple, the answer would be a list. But the output format says if it's a list of names or IDs, provide a comma-separated list. However, the question is asking for the Identification score, which is a single value. But if multiple respondents meet the criteria, each would have their own Identification score. Wait, but the question is phrased as ""the respondent"", which might imply a single respondent. But according to the data, there are multiple. Hmm, perhaps I need to check again.

Wait, let's go through each respondent one by one:

1. Respondent5: Date 2025-05-04, SessionName ""II - Anaphylaxsis"", Identification 3, Situation 3, Assessment 3.
2. Respondent2: Date 2025-04-04, SessionName ""MI"", Identification 3, Situation 3, Assessment 3.
3. Respondent18: Date 2025-05-04, SessionName ""IV - VT"", Identification 3, Situation 3, Assessment 3.
4. Respondent11: Date 2025-04-04, SessionName ""IV (AF)"", Identification 3, Situation 3, Assessment 3.

So all four of these have Situation 3 and Assessment 3, and each has Identification 3. Therefore, the answer should be 3. But the output format says to provide the human-readable value. The Identification question's rubric is: 0 = Requires direct prompting, 1 = Introduces themselves but only after a hint, 2 = Introduces themselves but information is incomplete, 3 = Introduces themselves and information is complete. So the value 3 corresponds to ""Introduces themselves and information is complete"". Therefore, the answer is ""Introduces themselves and information is complete"".

But the question is asking for the Identification of the respondent(s) who meet the criteria. If there are multiple, but all have the same score, then the answer is that score. So the answer is 3, which maps to the text as per the rubric.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Identification of the respondent whose total score for 'Assessment' and 'Background (history)' was exactly 5?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the Identification of the respondent whose total score for 'Assessment' and 'Background (history)' adds up exactly to 5. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The questions section defines each predicate. The 'Assessment' is under pred:Assessment, and 'Background_history' is under pred:Background_history. Both are scored on a rubric from 0 to 3.

Now, looking at the responses, I need to go through each respondent and check their scores for these two fields. For each respondent, I'll add the Assessment score and the Background_history score. If the sum is exactly 5, then their Identification score is the answer.

Let's list out all respondents:

- **Respondent17**: Assessment=3, Background_history=3 → 3+3=6 → Not 5.
- **Respondent6**: Assessment=2, Background_history=3 → 2+3=5 → This is a candidate. Their Identification is 3.
- **Respondent2**: Assessment=3, Background_history=2 → 3+2=5 → Another candidate. Identification is 3.
- **Respondent23**: Assessment=3, Background_history=2 → 5. Identification is 3.
- **Respondent3**: Assessment=3, Background_history=3 → 6. Not 5.
- **Respondent22**: Assessment=2, Background_history=3 → 5. Identification 3.
- **Respondent19**: Assessment=2, Background_history=3 → 5. Identification 3.
- **Respondent20**: Assessment=3, Background_history=2 → 5. Identification 3.
- **Respondent11**: Assessment=3, Background_history=3 → 6. No.
- **Respondent14**: Assessment=3, Background_history=2 → 5. Identification 3.
- **Respondent4**: Assessment=2, Background_history=3 → 5. Identification 3.
- **Respondent7**: Assessment=2, Background_history=2 → 4. No.

Wait, the question asks for the Identification of the respondent(s) where the sum is exactly 5. From the list above, multiple respondents have a sum of 5: Respondent6, Respondent2, Respondent23, Respondent22, Respondent19, Respondent20, Respondent14, Respondent4. All of them have Identification score 3. But the answer should be the Identification value, which is a rubric score. The question is asking for the Identification (the score) of the respondent(s) with the total of 5. Since all these respondents have Identification=3, the answer is 3. But wait, the question is phrased as ""the respondent whose total..."", but there might be multiple. However, the answer format expects a single value. Wait, let me check the data again.

Wait, the question says ""the respondent"" (singular), but there might be multiple. However, looking at the data:

Wait, let me recount:

Respondent6: 2+3=5 → Identification=3
Respondent2: 3+2=5 → Identification=3
Respondent23:3+2=5 → Identification=3
Respondent22:2+3=5 → Identification=3
Respondent19:2+3=5 → Identification=3
Respondent20:3+2=5 → Identification=3
Respondent14:3+2=5 → Identification=3
Respondent4:2+3=5 → Identification=3

All these respondents have Identification=3. So the answer is 3. But the question is asking for the Identification of the respondent(s) with the total score 5. Since all of them have Identification=3, the answer is 3. But wait, the output rules say to provide the human-readable value. Wait, the Identification question's rubric is:

""Identification of self, role, and patient. [Rubric: 0 = Requires direct prompting, 1 = Introduces themselves but only after a hint, 2 = Introduces themselves but information is incomplete, 3 = Introduces themselves and information is complete]""

So the value 3 corresponds to ""Introduces themselves and information is complete"". But the output instructions say for MCQ fields, map the code to the corresponding option text. However, in the data, the responses for Identification are numerical codes (e.g., ""3""). The question is asking for the Identification of the respondent(s), which is the rubric score. But according to the output rules, for MCQ fields, we need to map the code to the text. Wait, the question is asking for the Identification, which is a rubric. So if the response is ""3"", the corresponding text is ""Introduces themselves and information is complete"".

But the task is to output the Identification of the respondent(s) whose total is 5. Since all the qualifying respondents have Identification=3, the answer is ""Introduces themselves and information is complete"". However, the output rules state to provide the human-readable value, not the code. So even though the data uses numbers, the answer should be the text from the rubric.

Wait, but the question is phrased as ""What is the Identification of the respondent..."", and the Identification is a rubric with codes 0-3. The answer should be the text corresponding to the code. So for example, if a respondent has Identification=3, the answer is ""Introduces themselves and information is complete"".

But looking at the respondents who have a sum of 5, all of them have Identification=3. Therefore, the answer is ""Introduces themselves and information is complete"".

But wait, let me check each respondent again to confirm:

- Respondent6: Identification=3 → text is ""Introduces themselves and information is complete""
- Respondent2: Identification=3 → same
- Respondent23:3 → same
- Respondent22:3 → same
- Respondent19:3 → same
- Respondent20:3 → same
- Respondent14:3 → same
- Respondent4:3 → same

All of them have Identification=3, so the answer is the text for 3. Therefore, the answer is ""Introduces themselves and information is complete"".

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Assessment of the respondent whose score for 'Background (history)' was 2 and score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' was 2?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the Assessment score for a respondent who has a Background (history) score of 2 and a Recommendation (clear recommendation) score of 2. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The data has a list of respondents, each with various scores. The key here is to look for the respondent who has both pred:Background_history ""2"" and pred:Recommendation_clear_recommendation ""2"". 

Looking at the responses section, I'll go through each respondent one by one.

Starting with Respondent7: Their Background_history is 2, and Recommendation_clear_recommendation is 2. So that's a match. Their Assessment is 2. But wait, I need to check if there are others with the same criteria.

Next, Respondent22: Background_history is 3, so doesn't match. Skip.

Respondent11: Background_history is 3. No match.

Respondent8: Background_history is 3. No.

Respondent9: Background_history is 2, but Recommendation_clear_recommendation is 3. Doesn't match.

Respondent13: Background_history is 2, Recommendation_clear_recommendation is 2. So that's another match. Their Assessment is 2.

Respondent5: Background_history is 3. No.

Respondent10: Background_history is 2, Recommendation_clear_recommendation is 2. Another match. Assessment is 2.

Respondent20: Background_history is 2, but Recommendation_clear_recommendation is 2. Wait, no, Respondent20's Recommendation_clear_recommendation is 2. So that's a match. Their Assessment is 3.

Wait, let me check again. The task is to find the Assessment where Background_history is 2 and Recommendation_clear_recommendation is 2. So:

- Respondent7: Both 2 and 2. Assessment 2.
- Respondent13: Both 2 and 2. Assessment 2.
- Respondent10: Both 2 and 2. Assessment 2.
- Respondent20: Background_history is 2, Recommendation_clear_recommendation is 2. Assessment 3. Wait, no. Let me check Respondent20's data again.

Looking at Respondent20's data:
pred:Background_history ""2"" ;
pred:Recommendation_clear_recommendation ""2"" ;
pred:Assessment ""3"" ;

So yes, that's another match. So there are multiple respondents with these scores. But the question is asking for the Assessment of the respondent(s) meeting those criteria. However, the answer might be expecting all possible answers, but the output format says to provide the human-readable value. Wait, but the question is phrased as ""the respondent"", which might imply a single answer. But according to the data, there are multiple respondents. Let me check again.

Wait, the question is: ""What is the Assessment of the respondent whose score for 'Background (history)' was 2 and score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' was 2?""

So if there are multiple respondents, the answer would be the Assessment scores for each. But the output rules say to provide the answer directly. Let me check the data again.

Looking at all respondents:

- Respondent7: Background_history 2, Recommendation_clear_recommendation 2 → Assessment 2
- Respondent13: same → Assessment 2
- Respondent10: same → Assessment 2
- Respondent20: Background_history 2, Recommendation_clear_recommendation 2 → Assessment 3

Wait, Respondent20's Background_history is 2, and Recommendation_clear_recommendation is 2. So their Assessment is 3. So that's a different value. So there are multiple possible answers. But the question is phrased as ""the respondent"", which might be ambiguous. However, in the data, there are multiple respondents meeting the criteria. But perhaps the answer expects all possible Assessment scores. However, the example given in the initial prompt had a single answer. Let me check the example again.

In the example, the answer was ""2"" for a specific session and date. So perhaps the task here is to find all respondents with those two scores and report their Assessment. But the output rules say to provide the human-readable value. If there are multiple, how to handle that? The output rules don't specify, but the example had a single answer. Maybe the data actually has only one respondent with those exact scores. Wait, let me check again.

Wait, looking back:

Respondent7: Background_history 2, Recommendation_clear_recommendation 2 → Assessment 2

Respondent13: same → Assessment 2

Respondent10: same → Assessment 2

Respondent20: Background_history 2, Recommendation_clear_recommendation 2 → Assessment 3

Wait, so four respondents meet the criteria. But their Assessment scores are 2, 2, 2, and 3. So the answer would be multiple values. However, the output format says to provide the answer directly. Maybe the question is intended to have a single answer, but according to the data, there are multiple. This could be a problem. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in reading the data.

Wait, let me check each respondent again:

Respondent7: pred:Background_history ""2"" ; pred:Recommendation_clear_recommendation ""2"" → Assessment ""2""

Respondent13: pred:Background_history ""2"" ; pred:Recommendation_clear_recommendation ""2"" → Assessment ""2""

Respondent10: pred:Background_history ""2"" ; pred:Recommendation_clear_recommendation ""2"" → Assessment ""2""

Respondent20: pred:Background_history ""2"" ; pred:Recommendation_clear_recommendation ""2"" → Assessment ""3""

So four respondents. But the question is asking for ""the respondent"", which is singular. This suggests there might be an error in the data or the question. Alternatively, perhaps I misread the data. Let me check again.

Wait, Respondent20's pred:Recommendation_clear_recommendation is ""2"", yes. So their Assessment is 3. So there are four respondents. But the answer can't be multiple. Maybe the question is intended to have multiple answers, but the output format requires a single value. Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the data entry. Let me check if any of these respondents have other conflicting data.

Alternatively, maybe the question is looking for the Assessment rubric text, not the numerical value. Wait, the question says ""What is the Assessment..."", and the Assessment is a rubric with 0-3. The output rules say to provide the human-readable value. Wait, the schema for QAssessment is ""Makes logical assessment... [Rubric: 0 = No logical assessment, 1 = Assessment only after extended questioning, 2 = Assessment after minimal questioning, 3 = Comprehensive logical assessment without questioning]"".

So if the Assessment score is 2, the human-readable value is ""Assessment after minimal questioning"". If it's 3, it's ""Comprehensive logical assessment without questioning"".

But the question is asking for the Assessment of the respondent(s) with those two scores. So if there are multiple respondents, the answer would be multiple values. However, the output format says to provide the answer directly. The example given in the initial prompt had a single answer. So perhaps the correct answer here is that there are multiple, but the user expects a list. However, the output rules state for a list to provide a comma-separated list. But the question is phrased as ""the respondent"", which is singular. This is confusing.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in reading the data. Let me check each respondent again:

- Respondent7: Background_history 2, Recommendation_clear_recommendation 2 → Assessment 2 → ""Assessment after minimal questioning""

- Respondent13: same → Assessment 2 → same

- Respondent10: same → Assessment 2 → same

- Respondent20: same → Assessment 3 → ""Comprehensive logical assessment without questioning""

So there are four respondents, but three have Assessment 2 and one has 3. However, the question is asking for the Assessment of the respondent(s) with those scores. If the answer is multiple, but the output requires a single value, there's a conflict. But perhaps the data has a typo. Let me check the data again.

Looking at Respondent20:

:Respondent20 a :Person ;
    pred:Date ""2025-05-02"" ;
    pred:SessionName ""IV (VT)"" ;
    pred:Identification ""3"" ;
    pred:Situation ""3"" ;
    pred:Background_history ""2"" ;
    pred:Background_examination ""-1"" ;
    pred:Assessment ""3"" ;
    pred:Recommendation_clear_recommendation ""2"" ;
    pred:Recommendation_global_rating_scale ""3"" ;
    pred:Comments ""Good""  .

Yes, so pred:Recommendation_clear_recommendation is ""2"", and pred:Background_history is ""2"". So their Assessment is ""3"". So this is a valid case.

Therefore, the answer should list all Assessments for respondents meeting the criteria. But the output rules say to provide the answer directly. If the question expects a list, then the answer would be ""Assessment after minimal questioning, Comprehensive logical assessment without questioning"". But the example answer was a single number. However, the example was a different question. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is intended to have a single answer, and there's a mistake in the data. But according to the data provided, there are multiple respondents. However, looking back, maybe I missed that some respondents have different SessionNames or dates. Wait, the question doesn't mention any other criteria except Background_history 2 and Recommendation_clear_recommendation 2. So regardless of other fields, those two scores are the only criteria.

Therefore, the correct answer would be the Assessment scores for all such respondents. But the output format says to provide the human-readable value. If there are multiple, perhaps list them. But the example answer was a single value. However, the output rules for a list say to provide a comma-separated list. So in this case, the answer would be ""Assessment after minimal questioning, Assessment after minimal questioning, Assessment after minimal questioning, Comprehensive logical assessment without questioning"". But that seems messy. Alternatively, maybe the question expects the numerical values. But the output rules say to provide the human-readable value, not the code. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is designed to have only one correct answer, and the others are distractors. Let me check again. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in reading the data. Let me check each respondent again:

Respondent7: Background_history 2, Recommendation_clear_recommendation 2 → Assessment 2 → ""Assessment after minimal questioning""

Respondent13: same → Assessment 2 → same

Respondent10: same → Assessment 2 → same

Respondent20: same → Assessment 3 → ""Comprehensive logical assessment without questioning""

So four respondents, three with 2 and one with 3. But the question is asking for ""the respondent"", which is singular. This suggests that perhaps there's a mistake in the data or the question. Alternatively, maybe the user intended for there to be only one correct answer, but the data has multiple. However, based on the data provided, the answer would include multiple values. 

But according to the output rules, if the question asks for a list, provide a comma-separated list. So the answer would be ""Assessment after minimal questioning, Comprehensive logical assessment without questioning"". But since three respondents have 2 and one has 3, the list would have ""Assessment after minimal questioning"" three times and ""Comprehensive..."" once. But the output rules don't specify handling duplicates. Alternatively, maybe the answer is to list all distinct values. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question has a typo, and the intended answer is 2, but according to the data, there are multiple. However, the user might have intended a different scenario. But given the data as is, the answer should reflect the actual entries. 

Therefore, the correct answer is that there are four respondents, with three having Assessment 2 and one 3. But the output format requires a direct answer. Since the example answer was a single number, but the output rules for the current task might require a list. However, the output rules state for a list to provide a simple comma-separated list. So the answer would be ""2, 2, 2, 3"" if numerical, but according to the output rules, we need to map to the human-readable text. So the answer would be ""Assessment after minimal questioning, Assessment after minimal questioning, Assessment after minimal questioning, Comprehensive logical assessment without questioning"". But this seems too verbose and possibly not intended. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is designed to have only one correct answer, and the others are distractors. Let me check if any of the respondents have other conflicting data. For example, maybe the SessionName or Date is different. But the question doesn't mention those. The criteria are solely based on Background_history and Recommendation_clear_recommendation. 

Therefore, the answer should include all four respondents' Assessments. But since the output format requires a direct answer, and the example had a single value, perhaps the intended answer is ""Assessment after minimal questioning"" and ""Comprehensive logical assessment without questioning"". But I need to follow the data strictly. 

Given the ambiguity, but following the data, the answer is that there are multiple respondents. However, the user might expect the answer to be ""2"" and ""3"", but in human-readable form. But the output rules state to provide the human-readable value. So the answer would be a list of those values. 

But the output rules for a list say to provide a simple comma-separated list. So the answer would be ""Assessment after minimal questioning, Comprehensive logical assessment without questioning"". But since three respondents have ""Assessment after minimal questioning"" and one has the other, but the list should include each occurrence. However, the output rules don't specify handling duplicates. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is intended to have a single answer, and there's a mistake in the data. But based on the data provided, there are multiple answers. 

Given that, the correct answer according to the data is that there are four respondents, but the user might have intended a different scenario. However, as a meticulous data analyst, I must report the data accurately. Therefore, the answer is that the Assessments are 2, 2, 2, and 3, which in human-readable terms are ""Assessment after minimal questioning"" and ""Comprehensive logical assessment without questioning"". 

But the output format says to provide the answer directly. If the question allows multiple answers, then list them. Otherwise, if the question expects a single answer, perhaps there's an error. However, based on the data, the answer includes multiple values. 

But looking back, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the respondents again:

Wait, Respondent20's Background_examination is ""-1"", which is not a valid score according to the rubric (0-3). But the question doesn't mention Background_examination, so it's irrelevant here. 

So, the answer is that there are four respondents meeting the criteria, with three having Assessment 2 and one 3. Therefore, the human-readable answers are ""Assessment after minimal questioning"" and ""Comprehensive logical assessment without questioning"". 

But the output format requires a direct answer, so perhaps list all distinct values. Therefore, the answer is ""Assessment after minimal questioning, Comprehensive logical assessment without questioning"".

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

First, I need to understand the data structure. The questions section defines each field. The relevant ones here are QBackground_history and QRecommendation_global_rating_scale. The Background history is scored on a rubric from 0 to 3, and the global rating scale is also 0 to 3.

Now, looking at the responses, I need to filter respondents who are part of the 'III - Sepsis' session. Let's check each respondent:

- Respondent15: SessionName is ""III - Sepsis"", Background_history is ""2"".
- Respondent4: SessionName is ""III (Sepsis)"", Background_history is ""3"".
- Respondent3: SessionName is ""III-Sepsis"", Background_history is ""3"".
- Respondent7: SessionName is ""III-Sepsis"", Background_history is ""2"".

Wait, the session names have variations: ""III - Sepsis"", ""III (Sepsis)"", ""III-Sepsis"". The question specifies 'III - Sepsis', but I should check if all these variations are considered the same session. Since the task mentions 'III - Sepsis', maybe it's exact match. But sometimes, data might have typos or different formatting. However, in the data, Respondent15 has ""III - Sepsis"", while others have different formats. But the task might consider all variations of ""III Sepsis"" as the same session. Let me confirm.

The task says 'III - Sepsis', so perhaps it's looking for that exact string. But looking at the responses, Respondent4 has ""III (Sepsis)"", and Respondent3 and 7 have ""III-Sepsis"". The hyphen and parentheses might be part of the session name. However, the user might consider all these as the same session. Let's check all respondents with SessionName containing ""III"" and ""Sepsis"" regardless of formatting.

So, the respondents in III-Sepsis sessions are:

- Respondent15: III - Sepsis, Background_history 2
- Respondent4: III (Sepsis), Background_history 3
- Respondent3: III-Sepsis, Background_history 3
- Respondent7: III-Sepsis, Background_history 2

Now, among these, the highest Background_history is 3, achieved by Respondent4 and Respondent3.

Now, we need to find the Recommendation_global_rating_scale for these respondents. 

Respondent4: Recommendation_global_rating_scale is ""2"".
Respondent3: Recommendation_global_rating_scale is ""3"".

So, the highest Background_history is 3, and among those, the highest global rating scale is 3 from Respondent3. But the question asks for the global rating scale of the respondent with the highest Background history. If there are multiple respondents with the highest Background history (3), do we take the highest among their global ratings, or just report each? The question says ""the respondent"", which might imply a single respondent. Wait, but there are two respondents with Background_history 3 in III-Sepsis sessions. However, the task is to find the global rating scale of the respondent(s) with the highest Background history. If there are multiple, perhaps we need to list all, but the output format says to provide a simple answer. Let me check the output rules again.

The output rules state: For a list of names or IDs, provide a comma-separated list. But here, the question is asking for the Recommendation (global rating scale) value. If there are multiple respondents with the highest Background history, each might have different global ratings. But the question is phrased as ""the respondent"", which might be singular. Wait, perhaps the highest Background history is 3, and among those, we need to report their global rating. But the answer should be the value, not the respondents. If both have 3 and 2, but the highest is 3, but in the data, Respondent3 has 3, and Respondent4 has 2. Wait, no: Respondent3's global rating is 3, Respondent4's is 2. So the highest Background history (3) in III-Sepsis sessions is held by Respondent3 and Respondent4. Wait, no: Respondent3's SessionName is ""III-Sepsis"" and the task is about ""III - Sepsis"". Wait, the original task says 'III - Sepsis' session. So maybe only Respondent15 is in that exact session name. But the user might have intended all variations. This is a possible ambiguity.

Wait, the task says: ""in the 'III - Sepsis' session"". The exact session name in the data for Respondent15 is ""III - Sepsis"". Respondent4's session is ""III (Sepsis)"", Respondent3's is ""III-Sepsis"". So if the session name must exactly match ""III - Sepsis"", then only Respondent15 is considered. But his Background_history is 2. Then the highest in that exact session is 2. But the question is asking for the highest Background history in that session. If the session is strictly ""III - Sepsis"", then the answer would be 2, and the global rating scale for that respondent is 2. But if the session includes variations, then the highest is 3 (Respondent3 and 4), and their global ratings are 3 and 2. But the answer would be 3 (from Respondent3) as the highest. 

This is a critical point. The task's session name is 'III - Sepsis', which in the data is exactly the session name for Respondent15. The other respondents have different session names (with parentheses or hyphens). However, sometimes in data entry, such variations might be considered the same session. But without explicit instruction, we should match exactly. Therefore, only Respondent15 is in the 'III - Sepsis' session. His Background_history is 2. Therefore, the highest in that session is 2, and his global rating is 2. But the question is asking for the global rating of the respondent with the highest Background history in that session. If the highest is 2, then the answer is 2. But if the session includes variations, then the highest is 3. 

This is a possible point of confusion. The user needs to clarify, but since we have to work with the data as given, we must match the session name exactly. Therefore, only Respondent15 is in 'III - Sepsis', with Background_history 2, and his global rating is 2. Therefore, the answer is 2. But wait, the task says ""the respondent with the highest Background (history) in the 'III - Sepsis' session"". If the session is exactly 'III - Sepsis', then the highest is 2, and the global rating is 2. But if the session includes all variations (III - Sepsis, III (Sepsis), III-Sepsis), then the highest is 3, and the global rating is 3 (from Respondent3). 

But the task's session name is written as 'III - Sepsis', which matches exactly Respondent15's session. Therefore, the answer would be 2. However, in the data, Respondent4 has session ""III (Sepsis)"" and Background_history 3. If the user considers that as part of the same session, then the highest is 3. But the session names are different. For example, in the data, there are sessions like ""III (Sepsis)"" and ""III - Sepsis"". These might be different sessions. Therefore, the answer depends on exact matching. 

Given that, the correct approach is to match the session name exactly as provided in the task. Therefore, only Respondent15 is in 'III - Sepsis', with Background_history 2. Therefore, the highest in that session is 2, and the global rating is 2. But wait, the task is to find the global rating of the respondent with the highest Background history in that session. If the highest is 2, then the answer is 2. 

But wait, perhaps the user intended to include all variations of the session name. For example, maybe ""III - Sepsis"", ""III (Sepsis)"", and ""III-Sepsis"" are all the same session but entered differently. In that case, the highest Background_history is 3 (from Respondent3 and 4), and the global rating for those would be 3 (Respondent3) and 2 (Respondent4). So the highest among them is 3. 

But how to determine if the session names are considered the same? The data has different session names, so unless specified, we must treat them as different. Therefore, the answer would be 2 for Respondent15. But this seems counterintuitive. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to group all III-Sepsis sessions regardless of formatting. 

This is a possible ambiguity. However, given the data, the exact session name in the task is 'III - Sepsis', which only matches Respondent15. Therefore, the answer is 2. But I need to check the data again. 

Looking back at the data:

    pred:Recommendation_global_rating_scale ""3"" ;
    pred:Comments ""The patient/simulation is not oriented in TPP.

So, the session names are:

- ""III - Sepsis"" (Respondent15)
- ""III (Sepsis)"" (Respondent4)
- ""III-Sepsis"" (Respondent3 and 7)

The task specifies 'III - Sepsis', which exactly matches Respondent15. Therefore, the highest Background_history in that exact session is 2, and the global rating is 2. However, if the user intended to include all variations of the session name (III followed by Sepsis in any format), then the highest Background_history is 3 (Respondent3 and 4), and the highest global rating among them is 3 (Respondent3). 

But without explicit instructions to consider variations, we should stick to exact matches. Therefore, the answer is 2. However, in the example provided earlier, the answer was 2 for a similar question, which might indicate that exact matching is required. 

Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the session name, but given the data, we must proceed with exact matching. Therefore, the answer is 2.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Situation of the respondent whose score for 'Situation' was 3 and score for 'Background (examination)' was 3?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the Situation of the respondent who scored 3 in both 'Situation' and 'Background (examination)'. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The 'questions' section defines each field. The 'Situation' question is about identifying main problems with a rubric from 0 to 3. The 'Background_examination' is about giving appropriate examination/observations, also scored 0-3.

Now, looking at the 'responses' section, I need to check each respondent's scores for these two fields. Let's go through each respondent one by one.

- **Respondent12**: Situation=3, Background_examination=3. This matches both criteria. The SessionName is ""II (Anaphylaxis)"".
- **Respondent3**: Situation=2, Background_examination=3. Doesn't meet the Situation score.
- **Respondent8**: Situation=3, Background_examination=2. Background_examination is 2, so no.
- **Respondent23**: Situation=3, Background_examination=2. Again, Background_examination is 2.
- **Respondent10**: Both scores are 2. Doesn't qualify.
- **Respondent6**: Situation=2, Background_examination=3. Situation is 2.
- **Respondent15**: Situation=3, Background_examination=3. SessionName is ""III - Sepsis"".
- **Respondent19**: Situation=3, Background_examination=3. SessionName is ""I - MI"".
- **Respondent16**: Situation=3, Background_examination=3. SessionName is ""I - MI"".

Wait, there are multiple respondents with both scores as 3. The question is asking for the ""Situation"" of such a respondent. But the Situation here refers to the actual text value of their Situation response. Wait, no. Wait, the 'Situation' in the question refers to the answer they provided, but in the data, the 'Situation' is a numerical score. Wait, the question is phrased as ""What is the Situation of the respondent..."", but in the data, 'Situation' is a numerical score. Wait, no. Let me check the original task again.

The task says: ""What is the Situation of the respondent whose score for 'Situation' was 3 and score for 'Background (examination)' was 3?"" So, the 'Situation' here refers to the actual answer text, but in the data, the 'Situation' is stored as a numerical score. Wait, no. Wait, the 'Situation' in the responses is a numerical value (e.g., pred:Situation ""3""). The question in the schema for :QSituation is ""Identifies the main problem(s). [Rubric: 0 = ... 3 = ...]"". So the 'Situation' score is the rubric score. The task is asking for the 'Situation' of the respondent, which would be the text description corresponding to their score. But the output rules say for MCQ fields, map the code to the option text. So if the respondent's Situation score is 3, the answer would be the text for 3 in the rubric. 

Wait, the question is a bit ambiguous. Let me re-express the task. The user is asking for the ""Situation"" of the respondent who has a score of 3 in 'Situation' and 3 in 'Background_examination'. The 'Situation' here refers to the value of the Situation field for that respondent, which is a numerical score. But according to the output rules, for MCQ fields, we need to map the code to the corresponding text. 

Looking at the :QSituation question's rubric: 0 = Unable to identify..., 3 = Identifies and prioritizes the main problem(s) unprompted. So if a respondent has a Situation score of 3, the corresponding text is ""Identifies and prioritizes the main problem(s) unprompted"".

But the task is to find the Situation (the text) of the respondent(s) who have both scores as 3. So first, find all respondents with pred:Situation ""3"" and pred:Background_examination ""3"". Then, for each such respondent, output the Situation's text based on their score. But since the score is 3, the text is fixed as per the rubric. However, the answer would be the same for all such respondents. But maybe the question is actually asking for the SessionName or another field? Wait, no. Let me recheck the task.

Wait, the task is: ""What is the Situation of the respondent whose score for 'Situation' was 3 and score for 'Background (examination)' was 3?"" So the answer should be the Situation's text (from the rubric) for the respondent(s) meeting those scores. But in the data, multiple respondents have both scores as 3. For example, Respondent12, Respondent15, Respondent19, Respondent16. Wait, let's check each:

- Respondent12: Situation=3, Background_examination=3. So their Situation is 3, which maps to ""Identifies and prioritizes the main problem(s) unprompted"".
- Respondent15: Situation=3, Background_examination=3. Same mapping.
- Respondent19: Same scores, same mapping.
- Respondent16: Same scores, same mapping.

But the answer would be the same for all of them. However, the question might be looking for the actual SessionName or another field. Wait, no. The question is specifically about the 'Situation' of the respondent. But 'Situation' here refers to the rubric's text. So regardless of which respondent, the answer is the text for score 3. But that seems odd. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the actual response value, which is the score, but according to the output rules, we need to map it to the text. 

Wait, the output rules state: For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses to the corresponding option text. But in the data, the responses are numerical codes. The rubric uses numerical codes. So for the 'Situation' field, the response is a number (e.g., ""3""), which corresponds to the rubric's 3 = ""Identifies and prioritizes the main problem(s) unprompted"". Therefore, the answer should be that text. 

But the task is to find the Situation (the text) of the respondent(s) who have both scores as 3. Since all such respondents have a Situation score of 3, the answer would be the same for all. However, the user might be expecting to list all such respondents' Situation texts, but since they are all the same, the answer is just that text. 

But let me check the data again. Are there any respondents with Situation=3 and Background_examination=3? Let's list them:

- Respondent12: Yes. SessionName ""II (Anaphylaxis)"".
- Respondent15: Yes. SessionName ""III - Sepsis"".
- Respondent19: Yes. SessionName ""I - MI"".
- Respondent16: Yes. SessionName ""I - MI"".

All these have Situation=3, so their Situation text is ""Identifies and prioritizes the main problem(s) unprompted"". Therefore, the answer is that text. But the question is phrased as ""the respondent"", which might imply a single respondent. However, there are multiple. But perhaps the data has only one? Wait, no. The data shows multiple. So the answer would be the text corresponding to the Situation score of 3, which is the same for all. Therefore, the answer is ""Identifies and prioritizes the main problem(s) unprompted"".

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Identification of the respondent whose score for 'Background (history)' was 2 and score for 'Assessment' was 3?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the Identification of the respondent who scored 2 in 'Background (history)' and 3 in 'Assessment'. 

First, I need to make sure I understand the data structure. The questions section defines each field. The 'Background_history' question is about giving appropriate history with a rubric from 0 to 3. The 'Assessment' question is about making a logical assessment, also on a 0-3 scale. 

Now, looking at the responses, I need to filter through each respondent to find those with pred:Background_history ""2"" and pred:Assessment ""3"". Let's go through each respondent one by one.

Starting with Respondent1: Background_history is 2, Assessment is 3. That's a match. Their Identification is ""-1"". Wait, but the rubric for Identification is 0-3. The value here is ""-1"", which might be an error, but according to the data, that's their score. However, the question is asking for the Identification of the respondent, which is the score they received, not the question's text. So if their Identification is ""-1"", that's the value. But the rubric for Identification is 0-3, so ""-1"" might be invalid. But the data shows it as such. Hmm, maybe a typo. But according to the data, we have to take it as is. But let's check other respondents.

Respondent18: Background_history is 2, Assessment is 3. That's another match. Their Identification is 3. 

Respondent5: Background_history is 3, so not a match. 

Respondent9: Background_history is 2, Assessment is 2. So Assessment isn't 3. 

Respondent15: Background_history is 2, Assessment is 2. Not a match. 

Respondent2: Background_history is 2, Assessment is 3. That's a match. Their Identification is 3. 

Wait, so there are multiple respondents matching? Let me check again.

Wait, the data:

Respondent1: pred:Background_history ""2"", pred:Assessment ""3"" → Identification ""-1""

Respondent18: pred:Background_history ""2"", pred:Assessment ""3"" → Identification ""3""

Respondent2: pred:Background_history ""2"", pred:Assessment ""3"" → Identification ""3""

Wait, so three respondents? Let me check all:

Looking through all responses:

- Respondent1: Background_history 2, Assessment 3 → Identification ""-1""

- Respondent18: Background_history 2, Assessment 3 → Identification 3

- Respondent2: Background_history 2, Assessment 3 → Identification 3

Wait, but Respondent2's date is 2025-04-04, SessionName ""MI"". 

So the question is asking for the Identification of any respondent who has Background_history 2 and Assessment 3. There are multiple respondents here. But the answer needs to be the Identification value(s) for those respondents. 

But the task says ""the respondent"", which might imply a single answer. But according to the data, there are multiple. However, looking back at the data:

Wait, let me recheck each respondent:

Looking at all respondents:

- Respondent1: Background_history 2, Assessment 3 → Identification ""-1""

- Respondent18: Background_history 2, Assessment 3 → Identification 3

- Respondent2: Background_history 2, Assessment 3 → Identification 3

So three respondents? Wait, no. Let me check again:

Wait, in the data provided, the respondents are:

Respondent1: pred:Background_history ""2"" ; pred:Assessment ""3"" → Identification ""-1""

Respondent18: pred:Background_history ""2"" ; pred:Assessment ""3"" → Identification ""3""

Respondent2: pred:Background_history ""2"" ; pred:Assessment ""3"" → Identification ""3""

Wait, yes. So three respondents meet the criteria. But the question is phrased as ""the respondent"", which might be singular. However, the data may have multiple. The answer should list all such respondents' Identification scores.

But the output rules say if the question asks for a list, provide a comma-separated list. The task is asking for ""the Identification of the respondent"" (singular?), but if there are multiple, perhaps the answer is multiple. However, looking at the data, let's confirm:

Wait, in the data, Respondent1 has Background_history 2 and Assessment 3, but Identification is ""-1"". But according to the schema, Identification's rubric is 0-3. So ""-1"" is invalid. Maybe it's a typo, but according to the data, we have to take it as given. So the answer would include ""-1"", 3, 3. But the question is asking for the Identification, which is the score. So the answer would be the values of Identification for those respondents. 

But the output rules state to provide the human-readable value. For the Identification question, the rubric is:

0 = Requires direct prompting

1 = Introduces themselves but only after a hint

2 = Introduces themselves but information is incomplete

3 = Introduces themselves and information is complete

So each score corresponds to a text. However, the question is asking for the Identification score, not the text. Wait, the task says: ""What is the Identification of the respondent..."". The Identification is a rubric score. Wait, the question is phrased as ""What is the Identification..."", and the data for each respondent has a pred:Identification with a value. So the answer is the value, not the text. But according to the output rules, for MCQ fields, we need to map the code to the corresponding option text. Wait, but the Identification is a rubric score, which is a number. The question is asking for the score, but according to the output rules, for MCQ fields, we need to map the code to the text. 

Wait, the output rules state: ""For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.""

But in this case, the responses for Identification are numbers (e.g., ""3""), and the question's rubric is using numbers as the codes. So the rubric is:

0 = Requires direct prompting

1 = Introduces themselves but only after a hint

2 = Introduces themselves but information is incomplete

3 = Introduces themselves and information is complete

So the response code is the number, and the output should be the corresponding text. For example, if a respondent has pred:Identification ""3"", the answer should be ""Introduces themselves and information is complete"".

But the task is asking for the Identification of the respondent. So we need to map the numerical code to the text description from the rubric.

So for each respondent that meets the criteria (Background_history 2 and Assessment 3), we need to take their Identification code and convert it to the corresponding text.

So let's process each matching respondent:

Respondent1: Identification ""-1"" → but the rubric only has 0-3. So ""-1"" is invalid. However, according to the data, it's stored as ""-1"". But since the rubric doesn't have a ""-1"" option, perhaps this is an error. But according to the output rules, we have to follow the data. However, the output rules say to map the code to the corresponding option text. If the code is not present in the schema, perhaps it's an invalid value, but we still have to output it as per the data. Wait, the output rules say for MCQ fields, map the code to the text. If the code is not present (like ""-1""), maybe we output the code as is. But the output rules say ""map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text"". Here, the codes are numbers, not letters. Wait, the example given in the output rules is for letter codes (A, B, C), but in this case, the codes are numerical. So perhaps the numbers are the codes, and we need to map them to the text. For example, code ""3"" maps to ""Introduces themselves and information is complete"".

But the output rules state: ""For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.""

In this case, the responses use numbers as codes, and the schema uses numbers as the rubric. So the numbers are the codes, and we need to map them to the corresponding text. So for example, a response of ""3"" would map to ""Introduces themselves and information is complete"".

But Respondent1 has ""-1"" for Identification. Since ""-1"" is not a valid code in the schema (which is 0-3), how should we handle it? The output rules don't specify, but perhaps we should output the code as is if it's invalid. However, the output rules say to map the code to the text. If the code is not present, maybe we output the code. But the user might expect that. Alternatively, perhaps the ""-1"" is a typo and should be ignored. But according to the data, it's there. So perhaps the answer includes ""-1"", but since the question is about Identification, which is a rubric, and the valid codes are 0-3, maybe ""-1"" is an error. However, the task is to report the value as per the data. 

But according to the output rules, for MCQ fields, we must map the code to the text. So if the code is ""-1"", which isn't in the schema, perhaps the answer is the code itself, but the output rules say to map to the text. This is a bit ambiguous. However, given the example in the output rules, where a response of ""a"" maps to ""Abnormal"", which is the text for option A. So in this case, the code is a number, and the schema uses numbers as the rubric codes. Therefore, the code ""3"" would map to the text for 3. So for Respondent1, code ""-1"" is not in the schema, so perhaps we output the code as is, but the output rules say to map to the text. Since ""-1"" isn't a valid code, maybe the answer is ""Requires direct prompting"" (code 0) but that's not the case. Alternatively, the answer is ""-1"", but according to the output rules, we should map to the text. However, since ""-1"" isn't a valid code, perhaps the answer is just the code. But the output rules say to map any letter codes. Wait, the output rules mention letter codes, but here the codes are numbers. So maybe the numbers are treated as the actual values, not codes. Wait, the question's schema for Identification is a rubric with numerical codes. So the response's pred:Identification is the code. Therefore, the answer should be the text corresponding to that code. 

But if the code is ""-1"", which isn't in the schema, perhaps the answer is ""Invalid"" or the code itself. But according to the output rules, we must follow the schema. Since ""-1"" isn't a valid code, maybe it's an error, but the data shows it. So perhaps the answer includes ""-1"" as the code, but according to the output rules, we need to map it to the text. Since there's no text for ""-1"", perhaps we output the code. But the example in the output rules shows that even if the response is a letter, it's mapped to the text. So in this case, the numbers are the codes, and we need to map them. 

Wait, the schema for Identification is: [Rubric: 0 = ..., 1 = ..., 2 = ..., 3 = ...]. So the codes are 0,1,2,3. The response for Respondent1 is ""-1"", which is not a valid code. Therefore, according to the output rules, since it's an MCQ field, we need to map the code to the text. But since ""-1"" isn't in the schema, perhaps the answer is the code itself. However, the output rules state: ""map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema"". Here, the codes are numbers, not letters. So maybe the output rules don't apply here, and we just output the numerical value. But the question is about the Identification, which is a rubric with numerical codes. The user might expect the text description. 

This is a bit confusing. Let me check the output rules again. The output rules say for MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the responses to the corresponding option text. But in this case, the responses are numbers, and the schema uses numbers as codes. So perhaps the numbers are the codes, and we need to map them to the text. For example, code ""3"" maps to ""Introduces themselves and information is complete"". 

So for Respondent1, code ""-1"" is invalid, so there's no corresponding text. But according to the data, the value is ""-1"". The output rules don't specify how to handle invalid codes. However, the example given in the output rules uses letters, but here it's numbers. Maybe the numbers are treated as the actual values, not codes. Wait, no. The schema defines the rubric with numerical codes. So the numbers are codes. Therefore, the response's pred:Identification is the code, which should be mapped to the text. 

In that case, Respondent1's Identification is ""-1"", which is not a valid code, so there's no corresponding text. But according to the output rules, we have to map the code to the text. Since there's no text for ""-1"", perhaps we output the code as is. But the output rules say to map any letter codes. Since this is a number, maybe the rule doesn't apply, and we output the code. But the user might expect the text. 

Alternatively, maybe the ""-1"" is a typo and should be ""1"". But we can't assume that. We have to go by the data given. 

So, proceeding with the data as is:

Respondent1: Identification ""-1"" → no corresponding text, so output ""-1""

Respondent18: Identification ""3"" → ""Introduces themselves and information is complete""

Respondent2: Identification ""3"" → same as above.

But the task is to find the Identification of the respondent(s) who have Background_history 2 and Assessment 3. So the answer would be the Identification values for those respondents. 

But according to the output rules, for MCQ fields, we need to map the code to the text. So for Respondent1, since ""-1"" is not a valid code, perhaps we output the code as is. For the others, map to the text. 

But the output rules state: ""For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.""

In this case, the codes are numbers, not letters. So perhaps the output rules don't apply, and we just output the numerical value. But the schema defines the codes as numbers. So maybe the answer is the numerical value. 

Wait, the user's example in the output shows that for a response of ""a"", the output is ""Abnormal"". But in this case, the codes are numbers. So if the response is ""3"", the output should be the text corresponding to 3. 

Therefore, for each respondent:

- Respondent1: code ""-1"" → invalid, but output as per data? Or since it's not a valid code, perhaps it's treated as an open-ended response. Wait, the question for Identification is a rubric with codes 0-3, so it's an MCQ. Therefore, the response should be one of those codes. But the data has ""-1"", which is invalid. However, according to the output rules, we need to map the code to the text. Since ""-1"" isn't in the schema, perhaps we output the code as is, but the output rules say to map to the text. This is a conflict. 

Alternatively, maybe the ""-1"" is a typo and should be ""1"". But we can't assume that. 

Given the ambiguity, perhaps the safest approach is to output the code as is for invalid entries and the text for valid ones. But according to the output rules, the example shows that even if the response is a letter, it's mapped to the text. So in this case, the numbers are codes, and we need to map them. 

Therefore, for Respondent1, since ""-1"" is not a valid code, there's no corresponding text, so perhaps we output the code. But the output rules say to map any letter codes. Since this is a number, maybe the rule doesn't apply, and we output the code. 

But the user's example in the output shows that for a response of ""a"", the output is the text. So if the response is a code (number), we need to map it to the text. 

Therefore, for Respondent1, code ""-1"" is invalid, so no text. But the output rules don't specify. Maybe the answer is ""Requires direct prompting"" (code 0), but that's not correct. 

Alternatively, the answer is the code ""-1"", but according to the output rules, we should map to the text. Since there's no text, perhaps we output the code. 

This is a bit of a dilemma. However, given the data, the correct approach is to map valid codes to their text and leave invalid codes as is. 

So, the respondents meeting the criteria are:

- Respondent1: Background_history 2, Assessment 3 → Identification ""-1"" (invalid code)

- Respondent18: Background_history 2, Assessment 3 → Identification ""3"" → ""Introduces themselves and information is complete""

- Respondent2: Background_history 2, Assessment 3 → Identification ""3"" → ""Introduces themselves and information is complete""

Wait, but Respondent2's date is 2025-04-04, and their Background_history is 2, Assessment is 3. So they also meet the criteria. 

So there are three respondents: Respondent1, Respondent18, and Respondent2. 

But the task says ""the respondent"", which might imply a single answer. However, the data has three. But according to the data, Respondent1's Identification is ""-1"", which is invalid. The other two have 3. 

But the question is asking for the Identification of the respondent(s) with those scores. So the answer should list all such respondents' Identification values. 

But the output rules state: if the question asks for a list, provide a comma-separated list.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Situation of the respondent with the highest Recommendation (clear recommendation) in the 'II - Anaphylaxsis' session?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the Situation of the respondent with the highest Recommendation (clear recommendation) in the 'II - Anaphylaxsis' session. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The data has respondents with various properties, including SessionName, Date, Recommendation_clear_recommendation, and Situation. The question is about the session named 'II - Anaphylaxsis', so I need to filter all respondents who have that exact SessionName.

Looking at the responses, I see multiple entries. Let me go through each respondent:

- Respondent9: SessionName is ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"". The hyphen and parentheses might be a variation, but the example in the data shows that ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"" and ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" are considered the same session. For example, in the given example, the answer was for ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"" on 2025-05-04, and the answer was 2. So maybe the session names with different punctuation are considered the same. So I should consider both ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"" and ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" as the same session.

- Respondent23: SessionName is ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" (with a hyphen). The example in the data includes this as part of the same session. So perhaps the session name variations with different punctuation (parentheses, hyphens, etc.) are all considered the same. So I need to include all respondents where SessionName is any variation of ""II Anaphylaxsis"".

- Respondent5: SessionName is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" (with a hyphen and space). 

So the relevant respondents are Respondent9, Respondent23, and Respondent5.

Now, for each of these, I need to check their Recommendation_clear_recommendation score. The question asks for the highest Recommendation (clear recommendation) in that session. 

Looking at each:

- Respondent9: pred:Recommendation_clear_recommendation ""3""
- Respondent23: pred:Recommendation_clear_recommendation ""3""
- Respondent5: pred:Recommendation_clear_recommendation ""2""

Wait, no. Wait, let me check again:

Wait, Respondent9's Recommendation_clear_recommendation is ""3"", as per the data:

:Respondent9 ... pred:Recommendation_clear_recommendation ""3"" ...

Respondent23: pred:Recommendation_clear_recommendation ""3""

Respondent5: pred:Recommendation_clear_recommendation ""2""

So both Respondent9 and Respondent23 have a score of 3, which is the highest possible. The question is asking for the Situation of the respondent with the highest Recommendation. Since there are two respondents with the highest score (3), we need to check their Situation scores.

For Respondent9: pred:Situation ""3""

For Respondent23: pred:Situation ""3""

So both have Situation score 3. However, the question is asking for the Situation of the respondent with the highest Recommendation. Since both have the same highest Recommendation score, but the question is phrased as ""the respondent"" (singular), perhaps there's a tie. But maybe there's a mistake here. Wait, let me check the data again.

Wait, looking at the data:

Respondent5's SessionName is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"", and their Recommendation_clear_recommendation is ""2"". So the highest is 3 from Respondent9 and 23.

But the question is about the session 'II - Anaphylaxsis' (with hyphen and space). Wait, the session names in the data have variations:

- Respondent9: ""II (Anaphylaxsis)""
- Respondent23: ""II-Anaphylaxsis""
- Respondent5: ""II - Anaphylaxsis""

But in the task, the session name specified is 'II - Anaphylaxsis' (with a hyphen and space). However, in the example provided earlier, the session name ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"" was considered the same as ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" when answering. So perhaps all variations of ""II"" followed by Anaphylaxis with different punctuation are considered the same session. Therefore, all three respondents (9, 23, 5) are part of the same session.

But in the data, Respondent5's SessionName is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" (with hyphen and space), which matches exactly the session name in the task. However, the other two have different punctuation. But the example in the initial question considered ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"" as part of the session. So perhaps the session name is considered the same regardless of punctuation. Therefore, all three are part of the same session.

But let's confirm. The task says: 'II - Anaphylaxsis' session. So the exact match would be Respondent5. However, the example in the initial question had a session named ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"" and the answer was based on that. So perhaps the session names are considered the same if they start with ""II"" and have ""Anaphylaxsis"" regardless of punctuation. Therefore, all three respondents (9, 23, 5) are part of the session.

But let's check the data again. For example, in the example given, the user asked about the session 'II (Anaphylaxsis)' on '2025-05-04', and the answer was 2. Looking at the data, Respondent9 has that date and session name, and their Assessment is 2. Respondent5 has the same date but session name ""II - Anaphylaxsis"". So perhaps the session names are considered different if the punctuation is different. Wait, but in the example, the answer was based on Respondent9, but the task here is about 'II - Anaphylaxsis', which is Respondent5's session. But in the data, Respondent5's session is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"", while Respondent23's is ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" (without space), and Respondent9's is ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"".

This is a bit ambiguous. However, the task specifically asks for the session 'II - Anaphylaxsis' (with hyphen and space). So only Respondent5 matches exactly. But in the example, the session name in the question was 'II (Anaphylaxsis)' and the answer was based on Respondent9, which has that exact session name. So perhaps the session names are case-sensitive and punctuation-sensitive. Therefore, the exact match is required.

But the task here is for 'II - Anaphylaxsis' (hyphen with space). Looking at the data, only Respondent5 has that exact SessionName: ""II - Anaphylaxsis"". The others have ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"" and ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" (without space). Therefore, only Respondent5 is in the session as per the exact name. However, the example in the initial question considered ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"" as part of the session, but perhaps that's because the user's question specified that exact name. So in this case, the task is asking for 'II - Anaphylaxsis', so only Respondent5 matches. But wait, let's check the data again.

Looking at the data:

:Respondent5 a :Person ;
    pred:Date ""2025-05-04"" ;
    pred:SessionName ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" ;
    ... 

:Respondent23 a :Person ;
    pred:Date ""2025-03-14"" ;
    pred:SessionName ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" ;
    ... 

:Respondent9 a :Person ;
    pred:Date ""2025-05-04"" ;
    pred:SessionName ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"" ;
    ... 

So the task is about 'II - Anaphylaxsis' (with space and hyphen). Only Respondent5 has that exact SessionName. Therefore, the respondents in this session are only Respondent5. But wait, the example in the initial question had a session named 'II (Anaphylaxsis)' and the answer was based on Respondent9. So perhaps the session names are considered the same if they are variations of II Anaphylaxsis, regardless of punctuation. But the task here is specific to 'II - Anaphylaxsis', which is a different session name. Therefore, only Respondent5 is in that session. 

But that seems conflicting. Alternatively, maybe the session names are considered the same if the core is the same, regardless of punctuation. For example, ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"", ""II-Anaphylaxsis"", and ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" are all considered the same session. In that case, all three respondents (9, 23, 5) are part of the same session. 

But how to determine this? The data doesn't provide any explicit grouping, so we have to go by exact string matching. However, in the example, the user asked about 'II (Anaphylaxsis)' and the answer was based on Respondent9, which has that exact session name. So perhaps the session names are case-sensitive and exact. Therefore, in this task, the session name is 'II - Anaphylaxsis' (with space and hyphen), so only Respondent5 matches. 

But let's check the data again. Respondent5's SessionName is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" (with space before and after hyphen), while Respondent23's is ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" (no space), and Respondent9's is ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"". So if the task is looking for ""II - Anaphylaxsis"", only Respondent5 matches exactly. Therefore, the highest Recommendation_clear_recommendation in that session is Respondent5's score, which is 2. But wait, Respondent5's Recommendation_clear_recommendation is 2. But if we consider all variations, then Respondent9 and 23 have higher scores. 

This is a bit confusing. The key is to determine whether the session names are considered the same despite punctuation differences. Since the example treated ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"" as a valid session name when the question asked for that exact name, perhaps the session names are exact matches. Therefore, in this task, the session name is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"", so only Respondent5 is in that session. Therefore, the highest Recommendation_clear_recommendation is 2 (Respondent5's score), and their Situation is 3. 

But wait, the task is to find the Situation of the respondent with the highest Recommendation in that session. If only Respondent5 is in the session, then their Recommendation is 2, which is the highest. But if other respondents with different session name variations are considered part of the same session, then there might be higher scores. 

Alternatively, perhaps the user made a typo and the session name is intended to include all variations. For example, in the example, the session name was written as 'II (Anaphylaxsis)' but the answer included Respondent9. So perhaps the session name variations are considered the same. Therefore, in this task, even though the session name is written as 'II - Anaphylaxsis', we should include all variations. 

In that case, the respondents are 9, 23, and 5. Their Recommendation_clear_recommendation scores are 3, 3, and 2, respectively. So the highest is 3. The respondents with 3 are 9 and 23. Their Situation scores are both 3. So the answer would be 3. 

But the task asks for the Situation of the respondent with the highest Recommendation. If there are multiple respondents with the highest Recommendation, do we list all their Situations? The task says ""the respondent"", implying singular. But in the data, there are two respondents (9 and 23) with the highest score. However, their Situation scores are both 3, so the answer would be 3. 

But wait, let's check the data again. 

Respondent9: SessionName ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"", Recommendation_clear_recommendation 3, Situation 3.

Respondent23: SessionName ""II-Anaphylaxsis"", Recommendation_clear_recommendation 3, Situation 3.

Respondent5: SessionName ""II - Anaphylaxsis"", Recommendation_clear_recommendation 2, Situation 3.

If the session name in the task is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"", then only Respondent5 is included. But if the session name is considered to include all variations, then 9 and 23 are included. 

The problem is that the session names in the data have different punctuation. The task's session name is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"". The exact match is Respondent5. However, in the example provided, the session name was ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"" and the answer was based on Respondent9, which has that exact session name. Therefore, the session names are matched exactly. Therefore, in this task, only Respondent5 is part of the session ""II - Anaphylaxsis"". 

But Respondent5's Recommendation_clear_recommendation is 2. Therefore, the highest in that session is 2. But the question is asking for the Situation of the respondent with the highest Recommendation. Since Respondent5 is the only one in the session, their Situation is 3. 

But wait, this seems conflicting. Let me check the data again. 

Wait, the task is: ""What is the Situation of the respondent with the highest Recommendation (clear recommendation) in the 'II - Anaphylaxsis' session?""

If the session is exactly ""II - Anaphylaxsis"", then only Respondent5 is in that session. His Recommendation_clear_recommendation is 2, which is the highest in that session. Therefore, his Situation is 3. 

But if the session includes variations, then the highest is 3 from Respondent9 and 23, and their Situation is 3. 

This is a critical point. The answer depends on whether the session name is matched exactly or not. 

Looking back at the example provided in the initial question:

The user asked about the session 'II (Anaphylaxsis)' on '2025-05-04', and the answer was 2. In the data, Respondent9 has that exact session name and date, and their Assessment is 2, which matches the answer. Therefore, the session names are matched exactly. 

Therefore, in this task, the session name is 'II - Anaphylaxsis', which exactly matches Respondent5. Therefore, the highest Recommendation_clear_recommendation in that session is 2 (Respondent5's score), and their Situation is 3. 

But wait, that would mean the answer is 3. However, if the session name is considered to include variations, then the answer is 3. 

But according to the example, exact session names are required. Therefore, the answer here is 3, as Respondent5's Situation is 3. 

But wait, let me confirm. If the session name is exactly 'II - Anaphylaxsis', then only Respondent5 is included. His Recommendation_clear_recommendation is 2. Therefore, the highest in that session is 2, and the Situation is 3. 

But the question is asking for the Situation of the respondent with the highest Recommendation in that session. Since there's only one respondent in the session (Respondent5), the answer is 3. 

Alternatively, if the session name is considered to include variations, then the highest Recommendation is 3 (from Respondent9 and 23), and their Situation is 3. 

This is a problem of data interpretation. Since the example treated the session name as exact, I think we should do the same here. Therefore, the answer is 3. 

Wait, but Respondent5's Situation is 3. So regardless of whether the session is exact or not, the answer would be 3. Because even if we consider only Respondent5, his Situation is 3. If we consider others, their Situation is also 3. 

Wait, in that case, the answer is 3. 

But let me check again. 

If the session is exactly 'II - Anaphylaxsis', then Respondent5's Situation is 3. 

If the session includes variations, then both Respondent9 and 23 have Situation 3. 

In either case, the answer is 3. 

Therefore, the answer is 3. 

But wait, the example in the initial question had a session name with parentheses, and the answer was based on that. So perhaps the session names are considered the same if they refer to the same session number and topic, regardless of punctuation. For example, ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"", ""II-Anaphylaxsis"", and ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" are all considered session II on Anaphylaxis. Therefore, all three respondents are part of the same session. 

In that case, the highest Recommendation_clear_recommendation is 3 (from Respondent9 and 23), and their Situation is 3. 

Therefore, the answer is 3. 

But how to confirm this? The data does not explicitly state that these are the same session, but the example seems to treat them as such. 

In the example, the user asked about the session 'II (Anaphylaxsis)' on '2025-05-04', and the answer was 2. The data shows that Respondent9 has that session name and date, and their Assessment is 2. However, Respondent5 also has the same date but a different session name. But the example's answer was based on Respondent9. 

Therefore, session names are considered exact. Therefore, in this task, the session name is 'II - Anaphylaxsis', so only Respondent5 is included. His Recommendation_clear_recommendation is 2, which is the highest in that session. His Situation is 3. 

But the question is asking for the Situation of the respondent with the highest Recommendation. Since Respondent5 is the only one in the session, his Situation is 3. 

But this seems conflicting with the example. However, the example's session name was different. 

Alternatively, perhaps the session names are case-insensitive and punctuation-insensitive. For example, ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"" and ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" are considered the same. In that case, all three respondents (9, 23, 5) are part of the same session. 

In that case, the highest Recommendation_clear_recommendation is 3 (from 9 and 23), and their Situation is 3. 

Therefore, the answer is 3. 

Given that the example treated ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"" as a valid session name, and the task here uses ""II - Anaphylaxsis"", but the core is ""II Anaphylaxsis"", it's likely that",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Recommendation (global rating scale) of the respondent with the highest Recommendation (global rating scale) in the 'II (Anaphylaxsis)' session?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the Recommendation (global rating scale) of the respondent with the highest Recommendation (global rating scale) in the 'II (Anaphylaxsis)' session. 

First, I need to identify all respondents who participated in the session named 'II (Anaphylaxsis)'. Looking at the responses section, I'll go through each respondent's data.

Starting with Respondent9: Their SessionName is ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"" and the Date is ""2025-05-04"". The Recommendation_global_rating_scale for them is ""2"". 

Next, Respondent5: Their SessionName is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" with the same date ""2025-05-04"". The Recommendation_global_rating_scale here is ""3"". 

Wait, the session names are slightly different—one has parentheses and the other a hyphen. But the question specifies 'II (Anaphylaxsis)', so I need to check if ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" is considered the same session. Since the session name in the question uses parentheses and the data has a hyphen, but the core part is ""II"" and ""Anaphylaxsis"", it's likely a typo or variation. So both respondents 9 and 5 are part of the same session. 

Now, comparing their global rating scales: Respondent9 has 2, Respondent5 has 3. The highest is 3. 

According to the schema, the global rating scale's rubric is: 0 = Not at all confident, 1 = Confident but required extended questioning, 2 = Confident but required some further questioning, 3 = Confident and required little or no questioning. 

So the highest score of 3 corresponds to ""Confident and required little or no questioning"". 

Therefore, the answer should be the text for score 3 from the global rating scale question.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Situation of the respondent whose score for 'Situation' was 3 and score for 'Assessment' was 3?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the Situation of the respondent who scored 3 in both 'Situation' and 'Assessment'. 

First, I need to look at the data provided in the responses. Each respondent has various scores for different categories. The key here is to filter through each respondent and check their scores for 'Situation' and 'Assessment'.

Looking at the 'Situation' and 'Assessment' fields in each respondent's data:

- Respondent6: Situation=2, Assessment=2 → Doesn't meet the criteria.
- Respondent15: Situation=3, Assessment=2 → Situation is 3, but Assessment is 2. Not a match.
- Respondent18: Situation=3, Assessment=3 → Both are 3. This is a potential candidate.
- Respondent14: Situation=3, Assessment=3 → Another candidate. Wait, let me check the dates. The date here is 2025-03-14. But the question doesn't specify a date, just looking for any respondent with those scores.
- Respondent21: Situation=2, Assessment=2 → No.
- Respondent1: Situation=2, Assessment=3 → Situation is 2, so no.
- Respondent4: Situation=3, Assessment=2 → Assessment is 2.
- Respondent3: Situation=2, Assessment=3 → Situation is 2.
- Respondent22: Situation=3, Assessment=2 → Assessment is 2.
- Respondent12: Situation=3, Assessment=2 → Assessment is 2.

Wait, so Respondent18 and Respondent14 both have Situation=3 and Assessment=3. But the question is asking for the 'Situation' of the respondent. Wait, no, the question is phrased as ""What is the Situation of the respondent whose score for 'Situation' was 3 and score for 'Assessment' was 3?"" So, the answer should be the 'Situation' value's text description. Wait, no. Wait, the 'Situation' here refers to the actual response value, which is the rubric score. Wait, no, the question is a bit confusing. Let me re-read the task.

The task says: ""What is the Situation of the respondent whose score for 'Situation' was 3 and score for 'Assessment' was 3?"" So, the 'Situation' here refers to the text of the Situation question, which is ""Identifies the main problem(s). [Rubric: 0 = Unable to identify the main problem(s), 1 = Identifies the main problem(s) after extended prompting, 2 = Identifies the main problem(s) with fewer prompts needed, 3 = Identifies and prioritizes the main problem(s) unprompted]"".

But the answer should be the rubric text corresponding to the score of 3 for the Situation. Wait, no. Wait, the question is asking for the 'Situation' of the respondent. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me check the data again.

Wait, the 'Situation' in the data is a score (e.g., pred:Situation ""3""). The question is asking for the 'Situation' of the respondent who has both Situation=3 and Assessment=3. But the answer should be the text description of the Situation's rubric for score 3. Because the question is phrased as ""What is the Situation..."", which refers to the rubric's text, not the numerical score. Because the user wants to know what the Situation assessment was for that respondent. Since the respondent scored 3 in Situation, the corresponding rubric text is ""Identifies and prioritizes the main problem(s) unprompted"".

But wait, the task is to find the 'Situation' of the respondent. But the 'Situation' in the data is a numerical score. However, the question is likely asking for the textual description of the Situation rubric that corresponds to the score of 3, which is ""Identifies and prioritizes the main problem(s) unprompted"".

But first, I need to confirm which respondents have both Situation=3 and Assessment=3. From the data:

Looking again:

- Respondent18: Situation=3, Assessment=3
- Respondent14: Situation=3, Assessment=3

So there are two respondents meeting the criteria. But the question is asking for the 'Situation' of the respondent(s). However, the answer would be the same for both since they both have Situation=3, which maps to the same rubric text. But the question might be expecting a single answer. Wait, perhaps there's only one respondent with both scores. Let me check again.

Wait, in the data:

Respondent18:
pred:Situation ""3"" ;
pred:Assessment ""3"" ;

Respondent14:
pred:Situation ""3"" ;
pred:Assessment ""3"" ;

So both have those scores. But the question is asking for the 'Situation' of the respondent(s) who meet these criteria. The answer would be the rubric text for Situation score 3, which is ""Identifies and prioritizes the main problem(s) unprompted"".

But the user might be expecting to list the actual Situation value (the text description) for each of those respondents. However, since both have the same score, the answer is the same. Therefore, the answer is the rubric text for Situation score 3.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Recommendation (global rating scale) of the respondent whose total score for 'Background (examination)' and 'Assessment' was exactly 5?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the Recommendation (global rating scale) for the respondent whose total score for 'Background (examination)' and 'Assessment' adds up exactly to 5. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The 'Questions' section defines each field. The 'Background_examination' and 'Assessment' are both rubric-based scores. The 'Recommendation_global_rating_scale' is another rubric. 

Looking at the 'responses', each respondent has values for pred:Background_examination and pred:Assessment. I need to sum these two for each respondent and check if the total is 5. Then, for that respondent, find their pred:Recommendation_global_rating_scale value.

Let's go through each respondent:

- **Respondent18**: Background_examination=2, Assessment=3 → 2+3=5. So total is 5. Their Recommendation_global_rating_scale is 2. But wait, the question asks for the global rating scale, which is a separate field. So if this is the correct respondent, the answer would be the value corresponding to 2 in the GRS rubric. The GRS rubric is: 0=Not at all confident, 1=Confident but required extended questioning, 2=Confident but required some further questioning, 3=Confident and required little or no questioning. So 2 maps to ""Confident but required some further questioning"".

Wait, but let me check other respondents to make sure there's only one with a sum of 5.

- **Respondent2**: Background_examination=3, Assessment=3 → 6. Not 5.
- **Respondent12**: Background_examination=3, Assessment=2 → 5. Sum is 5. Their GRS is 3 → ""Confident and required little or no questioning"".
- **Respondent19**: Background_examination=3, Assessment=2 → 5. Sum is 5. GRS is 3.
- **Respondent23**: Background_examination=2, Assessment=3 → 5. GRS is 3.
- **Respondent5**: Background_examination=3, Assessment=3 → 6. Not 5.
- **Respondent14**: Background_examination=2, Assessment=3 → 5. GRS is 2.
- **Respondent20**: Background_examination=-1, Assessment=3 → 2. Not 5.
- **Respondent1**: Background_examination=2, Assessment=3 → 5. GRS is 2.

Wait, so multiple respondents have a sum of 5. Let me list them:

- Respondent18: sum 5 → GRS 2
- Respondent12: sum 5 → GRS 3
- Respondent19: sum 5 → GRS 3
- Respondent23: sum 5 → GRS 3
- Respondent14: sum 5 → GRS 2
- Respondent1: sum 5 → GRS 2

But the question says ""the respondent"" implying singular. But maybe there are multiple. However, the answer might require all of them. Wait, the task says ""the respondent"" (singular), but perhaps there are multiple. Let me check again.

Wait, the question is: ""What is the Recommendation (global rating scale) of the respondent whose total score for 'Background (examination)' and 'Assessment' was exactly 5?""

If there are multiple respondents with sum 5, then the answer would be all their GRS values. But the example given in the problem has an answer of ""2"", which is a single value. However, in the example, the answer was for a specific session and date, which narrowed it down to one respondent. Here, the task is different. Let me check again.

Wait, the current task is to find the GRS for any respondent where Background_examination + Assessment =5. So there might be multiple. But the output rules say to provide a list if needed. Let me check the output rules again.

The output rules state: If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a comma-separated list. But here, the question is about the GRS value(s) of such respondents. If multiple respondents meet the criteria, their GRS values would be listed. But the output should be the human-readable value, not the code. So for each respondent with sum 5, map their GRS code to the text.

Looking at the GRS rubric: 0=Not at all confident, 1=Confident but required extended questioning, 2=Confident but required some further questioning, 3=Confident and required little or no questioning.

So the respondents with sum 5 and their GRS:

- Respondent18: GRS 2 → ""Confident but required some further questioning""
- Respondent12: GRS 3 → ""Confident and required little or no questioning""
- Respondent19: GRS 3 → same as above
- Respondent23: GRS 3 → same
- Respondent14: GRS 2 → same as Respondent18
- Respondent1: GRS 2 → same

But the question is phrased as ""the respondent"", which might imply a single respondent. But according to the data, there are multiple. However, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation. Let me recheck each respondent's Background_examination and Assessment:

- Respondent18: Background_examination=2, Assessment=3 → 5. Correct.
- Respondent12: Background_examination=3, Assessment=2 → 5. Correct.
- Respondent19: Background_examination=3, Assessment=2 → 5. Correct.
- Respondent23: Background_examination=2, Assessment=3 → 5. Correct.
- Respondent14: Background_examination=2, Assessment=3 → 5. Correct.
- Respondent1: Background_examination=2, Assessment=3 → 5. Correct.

So six respondents meet the criteria. But looking at the data provided in the questionnaire, let me confirm:

Wait, in the data provided, the respondents are:

:Respondent18, :Respondent2, :Respondent12, :Respondent19, :Respondent23, :Respondent5, :Respondent14, :Respondent20, :Respondent1.

Now, checking each:

- Respondent18: 2 +3=5 → GRS 2
- Respondent12: 3 +2=5 → GRS 3
- Respondent19:3 +2=5 → GRS3
- Respondent23:2 +3=5 → GRS3
- Respondent14:2 +3=5 → GRS2
- Respondent1:2 +3=5 → GRS2

So total of 6 respondents. But the answer needs to list all their GRS values. However, the output rules say to provide the human-readable value. If multiple, perhaps list them all. But the example answer was a single value. Wait, the example question was about a specific session and date, so only one respondent. Here, the task is different. The user is asking for all respondents where the sum is 5, and then their GRS. But the output rules state: ""If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list"". The question here is about the GRS values, not names or IDs. So perhaps each GRS value should be listed. But the output should be the human-readable text. So for each respondent meeting the condition, output their GRS text. If there are multiple, list them all. But the output instructions say ""Provide your final answer directly and concisely."" So perhaps list all distinct GRS values. Let's see:

From the six respondents:

- GRS 2: Respondent18, Respondent14, Respondent1 → three times
- GRS 3: Respondent12, Respondent19, Respondent23 → three times

So the possible GRS values are 2 and 3. But the answer should be the text. So ""Confident but required some further questioning, Confident and required little or no questioning"". But the output rules say to provide the answer directly. However, the example answer was a single value. Maybe the question expects that there's only one respondent, but according to the data, there are multiple. But perhaps I made a mistake in calculation. Let me check again.

Wait, looking at Respondent5: Background_examination=3, Assessment=3 → sum 6. Not 5. Correct.

Wait, Respondent23: pred:Background_examination ""2"", pred:Assessment ""3"" → 5. Correct.

So yes, multiple respondents. But the question says ""the respondent"" (singular). This is conflicting. Maybe there's a mistake in the data entry. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps the session names or dates are different. Wait, the current task is not filtering by session or date, just the sum of Background_examination and Assessment. So regardless of other factors, if their sum is 5, their GRS is needed. Therefore, the answer should list all GRS values for those respondents. But the output format says to provide the answer directly. If there are multiple, perhaps list them all. However, the example answer was a single value, but that was for a different question. Let me check the output rules again.

The output rules state: ""If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list"". Since the question is about the GRS values, which are mapped to text, and there are multiple, the answer should list all distinct GRS texts. But how to present them? For example, if some have 2 and others 3, the answer would be both texts. However, the output must be the human-readable value. So if there are multiple, list them all. But the user might expect a single answer, but according to the data, there are multiple. 

Wait, but looking back at the data, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recheck each respondent's Background_examination and Assessment:

- Respondent18: 2 +3=5 → GRS 2
- Respondent12:3 +2=5 → GRS3
- Respondent19:3 +2=5 → GRS3
- Respondent23:2 +3=5 → GRS3
- Respondent14:2 +3=5 → GRS2
- Respondent1:2 +3=5 → GRS2

So the GRS values are 2 and 3. Therefore, the answer would be both ""Confident but required some further questioning"" and ""Confident and required little or no questioning"". But how to present this? The output rules say to provide the answer directly. If multiple, perhaps list them separated by commas. But the example answer was a single value. However, the example was a different question. 

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in calculation. Let me check again. Wait, Respondent12: Background_examination is 3, Assessment is 2. Sum 5. GRS is 3. Correct. Respondent19: same. Respondent23: sum 5. GRS3. Respondent14: sum5, GRS2. Respondent1: sum5, GRS2. Respondent18: sum5, GRS2. So yes, multiple. 

But the question is phrased as ""the respondent"", which is singular. This suggests that there's only one, but according to the data, there are multiple. This is a contradiction. Perhaps there's a mistake in the data entry. Let me check the data again.

Wait, looking at the data for Respondent5: pred:SessionName ""II - Anaphylaxsis"", pred:Date ""2025-05-04"". Their Background_examination is 3, Assessment is 3. Sum 6. Not 5. Correct.

Wait, perhaps the user made a typo, but according to the data, there are multiple respondents. Therefore, the answer should include all GRS values for those respondents. However, the output instructions say to provide the answer directly. If multiple, perhaps list them as comma-separated. But the output example was a single number. However, the example was a different question. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is looking for the GRS value(s) where the sum is exactly 5, and the answer is both 2 and 3. But according to the output rules, we need to map the code to the text. So the answer would be both ""Confident but required some further questioning"" and ""Confident and required little or no questioning"". 

But how to present this? The output rules don't specify handling multiple answers, but the example shows a single value. However, the example's question was specific to a session and date, which narrowed it down. Here, the question is broader. 

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again each respondent:

- Respondent18: Background_examination=2, Assessment=3 → 5. GRS=2
- Respondent12: 3+2=5. GRS=3
- Respondent19:3+2=5. GRS=3
- Respondent23:2+3=5. GRS=3
- Respondent14:2+3=5. GRS=2
- Respondent1:2+3=5. GRS=2

So there are two possible GRS values: 2 and 3. Therefore, the answer should list both. But the output format says to provide the human-readable value. So the answer would be:

""Confident but required some further questioning, Confident and required little or no questioning""

But the output rules state to ""provide your final answer directly and concisely"". If multiple, perhaps list them separated by commas. However, the example answer was a single value. But in this case, there are multiple correct answers. Therefore, the correct answer is both possible GRS values.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Recommendation (global rating scale) of the respondent from the 'II-Anaphylaxsis' session whose Recommendation (global rating scale) is higher than the average Recommendation (global rating scale) for all sessions on '2025-03-14'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the Recommendation (global rating scale) of the respondent from the 'II-Anaphylaxsis' session on '2025-03-14' whose GRS is higher than the average GRS for all sessions on that date.

First, I need to identify all respondents from '2025-03-14'. Let's look through the responses. 

Looking at the data:

- Respondent23: Date 2025-03-14, SessionName ""II-Anaphylaxsis"", GRS 3
- Respondent7: Date 2025-03-14, SessionName ""III-Sepsis"", GRS 2
- Respondent14: Date 2025-03-14, SessionName ""IV-Hypoglycemia"", GRS 2
- Respondent10: Date 2025-03-14, SessionName ""(MI)-VT"", GRS 2

So there are four respondents on that date. Now, calculate the average GRS. The GRS values are 3, 2, 2, 2. Sum is 3+2+2+2=9. Average is 9/4 = 2.25.

Now, the question is about the 'II-Anaphylaxsis' session. From the list, Respondent23 is in that session with GRS 3. Since 3 is higher than 2.25, this respondent meets the condition. The answer should be their GRS value. According to the output rules, since GRS is a rubric with numerical values mapped to descriptions, but the question asks for the value, which is ""3"". However, the output instructions say to provide the human-readable value. Wait, looking at the schema for QRecommendation_global_rating_scale, the rubric is:

0 = Not at all confident, 1 = Confident but required extended questioning, 2 = Confident but required some further questioning, 3 = Confident and required little or no questioning.

But the output rules state for MCQ fields to map the code to the corresponding text. However, the task asks for the ""Recommendation (global rating scale)"" which is the numerical value in the data. Wait, the user's task is phrased as ""What is the Recommendation (global rating scale) of the respondent..."". The data for GRS is stored as numbers (e.g., pred:Recommendation_global_rating_scale ""3""). The output rules say for MCQ fields to map the code to the text. But the question is asking for the value, which in the data is a number. However, the schema's QRecommendation_global_rating_scale is a rubric with numerical codes. So according to the output rules, since it's an MCQ field, we need to map the numerical code to the corresponding text. For example, if the response is ""3"", the output should be ""Confident and required little or no questioning"".

Wait, but the example given in the output rules uses letters (A, B, C), but here the codes are numbers. The output rules mention ""map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema"". But in this case, the responses use numbers, not letters. However, the schema's rubric uses numbers as the codes. So perhaps the same logic applies: map the numerical code in the response to the corresponding text in the schema.

So for the GRS, a response of ""3"" would map to ""Confident and required little or no questioning"". Therefore, the answer should be that text. But let me check the original example. In the example, the answer was ""2"", which is the numerical value. Wait, the example question was about the Assessment, which in the data is a numerical value, and the answer was ""2"". The output rules say for MCQ fields to output the text, but in the example, the answer was the numerical value. Hmm, this is conflicting.

Wait, looking back at the example provided:

The user's question was: ""What is the Assessment of the respondent from the 'II (Anaphylaxsis)' session on '2025-05-04'?""

The answer given was ""2"". The Assessment in the data for that respondent (assuming the correct one) was ""2"". The schema for QAssessment is a rubric with numerical codes. The example's answer is the numerical code, not the text. But according to the output rules, for MCQ fields, the answer should be the text. However, the example's answer is the numerical value. This suggests that perhaps the output should be the numerical value as per the data, not the mapped text. But this contradicts the output rules. Wait, maybe the example is incorrect, or perhaps the Assessment is not considered an MCQ field. Let me check the schema.

Looking at the schema for QAssessment: it's a rubric with numerical codes 0-3. The output rules state that for MCQ fields (which this is), the answer should be the text corresponding to the code. But in the example, the answer is ""2"", which is the code. This is confusing. Maybe the example is wrong, or perhaps the task is expecting the code. Alternatively, maybe the Assessment is not considered an MCQ but a numerical value. But according to the schema, it's a rubric, which is an MCQ. So there's inconsistency here.

But given that the example answer is the numerical code, perhaps the intended answer here is the numerical value. However, the output rules clearly state that for MCQ fields, the answer should be the text, not the code. So this is a conflict. But perhaps in the case where the rubric uses numerical codes, the answer is the code. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the example. Let's proceed with the output rules as written.

In the current task, the question is about the Recommendation (global rating scale), which is an MCQ with numerical codes. The output rules say to map the code to the text. So if the respondent's GRS is 3, the answer should be ""Confident and required little or no questioning"".

But let's check the data again. The respondent in question is Respondent23, who has pred:Recommendation_global_rating_scale ""3"". According to the schema, that maps to ""Confident and required little or no questioning"". Therefore, the answer should be that text. However, the example in the problem shows that the answer was the numerical code. But the example's answer might be a mistake. Following the output rules strictly, the answer should be the text. But perhaps the task is expecting the numerical value. Let me check the task again.

The task says: ""What is the Recommendation (global rating scale) of the respondent..."". The data stores it as a numerical value. The output rules say for MCQ fields to output the text. Therefore, the answer should be the text corresponding to the code. So for Respondent23, GRS 3, the answer is ""Confident and required little or no questioning"".

But wait, the average GRS for 2025-03-14 is 2.25. The respondent in question has GRS 3, which is higher than 2.25. So the answer is their GRS value, which is 3, but mapped to the text. Therefore, the answer is ""Confident and required little or no questioning"".

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Background (examination) of the respondent whose score for 'Background (examination)' was 1 and score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' was 3?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the Background (examination) of the respondent who scored 1 in 'Background (examination)' and 3 in 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)'. 

First, I need to understand the structure of the data provided. The data includes a list of respondents with various scores across different categories. The key here is to look for the specific scores in two categories: Background_examination and Recommendation_clear_recommendation.

Looking at the 'Questions' section, the 'Background (examination)' corresponds to the predicate pred:Background_examination, and the 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' is pred:Recommendation_clear_recommendation. The question asks for the value of the Background_examination for the respondent who has a score of 1 in that category and a score of 3 in Recommendation_clear_recommendation.

Now, I'll go through each respondent in the 'Responses' section and check their scores for these two predicates. Let's list them out:

- Respondent8: Background_examination ""2"", Recommendation_clear_recommendation ""2"" → Doesn't match.
- Respondent6: Background_examination ""3"", Recommendation_clear_recommendation ""2"" → No.
- Respondent22: Background_examination ""3"", Recommendation_clear_recommendation ""2"" → No.
- Respondent14: Background_examination ""2"", Recommendation_clear_recommendation ""1"" → No.
- Respondent1: Background_examination ""2"", Recommendation_clear_recommendation ""2"" → No.
- Respondent21: Background_examination ""1"", Recommendation_clear_recommendation ""3"" → This matches both criteria!
- Respondent11: Background_examination ""3"", Recommendation_clear_recommendation ""3"" → Background_examination is 3, not 1.
- Respondent20: Background_examination ""-1"", Recommendation_clear_recommendation ""2"" → No.
- Respondent13: Background_examination ""1"", Recommendation_clear_recommendation ""2"" → Recommendation score is 2, not 3.

Only Respondent21 has Background_examination ""1"" and Recommendation_clear_recommendation ""3"". The question asks for the Background (examination) of this respondent. However, the Background_examination score is 1, which according to the schema for QBackground_examination, the rubric is: 

""Gives appropriate examination/observations. [Rubric: 0 = Observations are omitted or irrelevant, 1 = Observations reported but frequent clarification needed, 2 = Observations reported with few further questions needed, 3 = Comprehensive focused examination/observations]""

So, a score of 1 corresponds to ""Observations reported but frequent clarification needed"". Therefore, the answer should be the text associated with the score 1 in the rubric for Background_examination.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Recommendation (global rating scale) of the respondent with the highest Identification in the 'I-VF' session?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the Recommendation (global rating scale) of the respondent with the highest Identification in the 'I-VF' session. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The data has a 'questions' section that defines each predicate, and a 'responses' section with individual respondents. 

The key points here are:
1. Find all respondents in the 'I-VF' session.
2. Among those, identify the one with the highest Identification score.
3. For that respondent, report their Recommendation_global_rating_scale value.

Starting with the first step: looking for respondents where pred:SessionName is ""I-VF"". Scanning through the responses, I see that Respondent13 has SessionName ""I-VF"". The other respondents have different session names like ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"", ""III (Sepsis)"", etc. So Respondent13 is the only one in the 'I-VF' session.

Next, check their Identification score. Respondent13 has pred:Identification ""3"". Since there's only one respondent in the 'I-VF' session, they automatically have the highest Identification score (which is 3 here). 

Now, look at their Recommendation_global_rating_scale. For Respondent13, that value is ""2"". 

According to the questions schema, QRecommendation_global_rating_scale has the rubric: 0 = Not at all confident, 1 = Confident but required extended questioning, 2 = Confident but required some further questioning, 3 = Confident and required little or no questioning. 

The output should be the text corresponding to the value ""2"", which is ""Confident but required some further questioning"". 

I need to make sure there are no other respondents in the 'I-VF' session. Checking again, Respondent13 is the only one. So the answer is based on their data.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Background (history) of the respondent whose score for 'Background (history)' was 2 and score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' was 2?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the Background (history) of the respondent who scored 2 in 'Background (history)' and 2 in 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)'. 

First, I need to make sure I understand the data structure. The questions section defines each field. The 'Background_history' question is about giving appropriate history with a rubric from 0 to 3. Similarly, 'Recommendation_clear_recommendation' is about making a clear recommendation, also scored 0-3.

Now, looking at the responses, I need to check each respondent's scores for these two fields. Let's go through each respondent one by one.

Starting with Respondent12: Background_history is 3, Recommendation_clear_recommendation is 3. Doesn't match.

Respondent10: Background_history is 2, Recommendation_clear_recommendation is 2. That's a match! But wait, let me check others to ensure there's no duplicate.

Respondent8: Background_history is 3, Recommendation_clear_recommendation is 2. Not a match.

Respondent21: Background_history is 3, Recommendation_clear_recommendation is 3. No.

Respondent1: Background_history is 2, Recommendation_clear_recommendation is 2. Another match. Wait, but the question says ""the respondent"", implying singular. Are there multiple?

Wait, let me check again. Respondent10 has both scores as 2. Respondent1 also has Background_history 2 and Recommendation_clear_recommendation 2. So two respondents? But the question might have a typo or maybe I missed something.

Wait, looking at Respondent1's data: pred:Background_history ""2"" and pred:Recommendation_clear_recommendation ""2"". Yes. So both Respondent10 and Respondent1 have these scores. But the question asks for ""the respondent"", which might suggest there's only one. Let me check again.

Wait, looking back at the data:

Wait, Respondent10's pred:Background_history is 2, pred:Recommendation_clear_recommendation is 2. Correct.

Respondent1: pred:Background_history ""2"", pred:Recommendation_clear_recommendation ""2"". So both have 2 and 2. But the question is asking for the Background (history) of such a respondent. The answer would be the value of their Background_history, which is 2. But wait, the question is phrased as ""What is the Background (history) of the respondent..."", which refers to the actual history text, but in the data, the Background_history is a score. Wait, no. Wait, the 'Background_history' in the responses is a numerical score. The question in the schema for QBackground_history is ""Gives appropriate history. [Rubric: 0 = ...]"". So the answer should be the rubric text corresponding to the score 2. 

Wait, the task is to find the Background (history) of the respondent(s) who scored 2 in both. But the answer would be the rubric description for score 2 in Background_history. Let me check the schema for QBackground_history: ""Gives appropriate history. [Rubric: 0 = History is unstructured or non-relevant, 1 = Relevant history but frequent clarification needed, 2 = Relevant history with few further questions needed, 3 = Comprehensive focused history]"". So a score of 2 corresponds to ""Relevant history with few further questions needed"".

But the question is asking for the Background (history) of the respondent(s) with those scores. Wait, but in the data, the Background_history is a score, not a text. So the answer would be the rubric text for score 2. But the user's output rules say for MCQ fields, map the code to the option text. So if the question is about the Background (history) which is a rubric, the answer is the text corresponding to the score 2. 

But the task is phrased as ""What is the Background (history) of the respondent..."", which might be confusing. But given the data, the Background_history is a score, and the question is asking for the value (the rubric text) of that score when the respondent has 2 in both fields. 

But the respondents with Background_history 2 and Recommendation_clear_recommendation 2 are Respondent10 and Respondent1. Wait, let me check again:

Looking at the data:

Respondent10:
- pred:Background_history ""2""
- pred:Recommendation_clear_recommendation ""2""

Respondent1:
- pred:Background_history ""2""
- pred:Recommendation_clear_recommendation ""2""

So both have 2 in both fields. Therefore, the Background (history) for these respondents is the rubric text for score 2, which is ""Relevant history with few further questions needed"".

But the question is asking for the Background (history) of the respondent(s) who meet those criteria. Since there are two respondents, but the answer should be the rubric text, which is the same for both. So the answer is ""Relevant history with few further questions needed"".

Wait, but the output rules say to provide the human-readable value. Since the Background_history is a rubric score, the answer is the text corresponding to 2. So regardless of which respondent, the answer is the same. So the answer is ""Relevant history with few further questions needed"".

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Recommendation (clear recommendation) of the respondent whose total score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and 'Situation' was exactly 4?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the recommendation (clear recommendation) of the respondent whose total score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and 'Situation' adds up to exactly 4. 

First, I need to understand the structure of the data provided. The data includes multiple respondents with various scores across different categories. The key here is to look at two specific fields: 'Recommendation_clear_recommendation' and 'Situation'. 

Looking at the questions section, the 'Situation' question has a rubric where the score can be 0 to 3. Similarly, the 'Recommendation_clear_recommendation' also has a rubric from 0 to 3. The task is to find a respondent where the sum of these two scores is exactly 4.

Now, I need to go through each respondent in the responses section and check their scores for these two fields. Let's list them out:

- Respondent12: Situation=3, Recommendation_clear_recommendation=3 → 3+3=6 (Not 4)
- Respondent21: Situation=2, Recommendation=3 → 2+3=5 (No)
- Respondent17: Situation=3, Recommendation=3 → 6 (No)
- Respondent13: Situation=3, Recommendation=2 → 5 (No)
- Respondent18: Situation=3, Recommendation=2 → 5 (No)
- Respondent11: Situation=3, Recommendation=3 → 6 (No)
- Respondent1: Situation=2, Recommendation=2 → 4 (Yes)
- Respondent4: Situation=3, Recommendation=2 → 5 (No)
- Respondent15: Situation=3, Recommendation=2 → 5 (No)
- Respondent5: Situation=3, Recommendation=2 → 5 (No)

Wait, Respondent1 has Situation=2 and Recommendation_clear_recommendation=2. 2+2=4. That's the one. Now, the question asks for the 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' of this respondent. 

Looking at Respondent1's data, the 'Recommendation_clear_recommendation' is ""2"". According to the schema for that question, the rubric is: 0 = No recommendation, 1 = Clear recommendation only after extended questioning, 2 = Clear recommendation after minimal questioning, 3 = Clear comprehensive recommendation without questioning. 

So, the value ""2"" corresponds to ""Clear recommendation after minimal questioning"". 

Therefore, the answer should be this text. Let me double-check if there are any other respondents with a sum of 4. From the list above, only Respondent1 meets the criteria. So the correct answer is the recommendation corresponding to their score.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Background (examination) of the respondent whose score for 'Identification' was 3 and score for 'Background (history)' was 3?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the Background (examination) score of the respondent who has a score of 3 in Identification and 3 in Background (history). 

First, I need to look through all the respondents in the data provided. Each respondent has various scores under different categories. The key here is to filter out the respondents who meet both conditions: Identification score of 3 and Background_history score of 3.

Starting with Respondent4: Their Identification is 3, Background_history is 3. That's a match! Now, check their Background_examination score. It's 2. So the answer here would be 2. But wait, let me check the other respondents to make sure there's no one else.

Next, Respondent13: Identification is 3, but Background_history is 2. Doesn't meet both conditions.

Respondent19: Identification 3, Background_history 3. Background_examination is 3. Wait, this is another match. But the question is asking for the respondent with Identification 3 and Background_history 3. So both Respondent4 and Respondent19 meet the criteria. But the answer can't be two values. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, let me check again. The task says ""the respondent"", implying there's only one. Let me check all respondents again.

Respondent7: Background_history is 2. No.

Respondent9: Background_history is 2. No.

Respondent2: Background_history is 2. No.

Respondent14: Background_history is 2. No.

Respondent1: Identification is -1. No.

Respondent21: Background_history is 3, Identification is 3. Background_examination is 1. So that's another match. Wait, so now there are three respondents: Respondent4, Respondent19, and Respondent21. But wait, Respondent21's Background_history is 3? Let me check again.

Looking at Respondent21's data: pred:Background_history ""3"". Yes. So Identification is 3, Background_history is 3. So their Background_examination is 1. Hmm. So now there are three respondents meeting the criteria. But the question is phrased as ""the respondent"", which might suggest a single answer. But according to the data, there are multiple. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in reading the data.

Wait, let's list all respondents with Identification 3 and Background_history 3:

- Respondent4: Identification 3, Background_history 3 → Background_examination 2
- Respondent19: Identification 3, Background_history 3 → Background_examination 3
- Respondent21: Identification 3, Background_history 3 → Background_examination 1
- Respondent11: Identification 3, Background_history 3 → Background_examination 3

Wait, Respondent11: pred:Background_history ""3"", Identification ""3"". So their Background_examination is 3. So that's four respondents. Wait, but looking back at the data:

Looking at Respondent11's entry:

:Respondent11 a :Person ;
    pred:Date ""2025-04-04"" ;
    pred:SessionName ""IV (AF)"" ;
    pred:Identification ""3"" ;
    pred:Situation ""3"" ;
    pred:Background_history ""3"" ;
    pred:Background_examination ""3"" ;
    pred:Assessment ""3"" ;
    pred:Recommendation_clear_recommendation ""3"" ;
    pred:Recommendation_global_rating_scale ""3"" ;
    pred:Comments ""Clear communication and handover""  .

Yes, so Background_history is 3, Identification is 3. So their Background_examination is 3. So that's another one.

So there are four respondents meeting the criteria. But the question is asking for ""the respondent"", which might be a mistake, or perhaps I misread the data. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in checking the data. Let me go through each respondent again carefully.

List of all respondents:

1. Respondent4: Identification 3, Background_history 3 → Background_examination 2
2. Respondent19: Identification 3, Background_history 3 → Background_examination 3
3. Respondent21: Identification 3, Background_history 3 → Background_examination 1
4. Respondent11: Identification 3, Background_history 3 → Background_examination 3

So four respondents meet the criteria. But the question is phrased as ""the respondent"", which suggests a singular answer. This implies that perhaps there's only one, but according to the data, there are multiple. However, maybe the user made a typo, or perhaps I misread the data. Let me check again.

Wait, looking at Respondent21's Background_history: pred:Background_history ""3"". Yes. So they have Identification 3, Background_history 3. So their Background_examination is 1. So there are four respondents. Therefore, the answer would be multiple values. But the output format requires a single answer. This suggests that perhaps there's an error in the data or the question. However, according to the data provided, there are multiple respondents meeting the criteria. But the task is to provide the answer, so perhaps the correct answer is the list of their Background_examination scores. But the output rules say for a list, provide a comma-separated list. However, the task says ""the respondent"", which is singular. Maybe the user intended to have only one, but the data has multiple. 

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check each respondent again:

- Respondent4: Background_history is 3, Identification 3 → correct. Background_examination 2.
- Respondent19: Background_history 3, Identification 3 → correct. Background_examination 3.
- Respondent21: Background_history 3, Identification 3 → correct. Background_examination 1.
- Respondent11: Background_history 3, Identification 3 → correct. Background_examination 3.

So four respondents. But the question is asking for ""the respondent"", which is singular. This is conflicting. However, the user might have intended for there to be only one, but according to the data, there are four. Therefore, the answer would be the Background_examination scores of all these respondents. But the output rules state that if the question asks for a list, provide a comma-separated list. However, the task is phrased as ""What is the Background (examination) of the respondent..."", which is singular. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is that there are multiple respondents, but the user might have intended a different scenario. Alternatively, maybe I misread the data. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps the user made a typo in the task. Alternatively, maybe I missed a respondent. Let me check each respondent again:

Looking at all respondents:

- Respondent4: Yes, meets criteria.
- Respondent13: No.
- Respondent19: Yes.
- Respondent7: No.
- Respondent9: No.
- Respondent2: No.
- Respondent14: No.
- Respondent1: No.
- Respondent21: Yes.
- Respondent22: No (Background_history 3, but Identification 3. Wait, Respondent22's Background_history is 3, Identification 3. So that's another one. Wait, no: looking at Respondent22's data:

:Respondent22 a :Person ;
    pred:Date ""2025-05-16"" ;
    pred:SessionName ""IV (VT)"" ;
    pred:Identification ""3"" ;
    pred:Situation ""3"" ;
    pred:Background_history ""3"" ;
    pred:Background_examination ""3"" ;
    pred:Assessment ""2"" ;
    pred:Recommendation_clear_recommendation ""2"" ;
    pred:Recommendation_global_rating_scale ""3"" ;
    pred:Comments ""Clear communication skills
Good""  .

So yes, Respondent22 also has Identification 3 and Background_history 3. So their Background_examination is 3. So that's another one. So now we have five respondents. Wait, this is getting more. So the answer would be 2,3,1,3,3. But the task says ""the respondent"", which is singular. This is confusing. 

Wait, perhaps the user intended to have only one respondent, but the data has multiple. In that case, the answer would be a list. But according to the output rules, if the question asks for a list, provide a comma-separated list. However, the task is phrased as ""the respondent"", which is singular. Therefore, there's a discrepancy. 

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in reading the data. Let me check again. Wait, perhaps some respondents have different values. Let me list all respondents with Identification 3 and Background_history 3:

1. Respondent4: Background_examination 2
2. Respondent19: Background_examination 3
3. Respondent21: Background_examination 1
4. Respondent11: Background_examination 3
5. Respondent22: Background_examination 3

So five respondents. Therefore, the answer would be the Background_examination scores of these five: 2,3,1,3,3. But the output format requires a single answer. However, the task is phrased as ""the respondent"", which is singular. This suggests that perhaps there's an error in the data or the question. But according to the data provided, there are multiple respondents meeting the criteria. 

But looking back at the example given in the problem, the answer was a single value (2). So perhaps in this case, the correct answer is a list. However, the output rules state that if the question asks for a list, provide a comma-separated list. But the task here is phrased as ""the respondent"", which is singular. Therefore, this is conflicting. 

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the criteria. Let me recheck the task: ""the respondent whose score for 'Identification' was 3 and score for 'Background (history)' was 3"". So the user is asking for the Background examination of the respondent (singular) who has both Identification 3 and Background history 3. But according to the data, there are multiple such respondents. Therefore, the answer should be a list of their Background examination scores. However, the output rules say for a list, provide a comma-separated list. So the answer would be ""2,3,1,3,3"". But I need to check again if all these respondents meet the criteria.

Wait, let's list them again:

- Respondent4: Identification 3, Background_history 3 → Background_examination 2
- Respondent19: Identification 3, Background_history 3 → Background_examination 3
- Respondent21: Identification 3, Background_history 3 → Background_examination 1
- Respondent11: Identification 3, Background_history 3 → Background_examination 3
- Respondent22: Identification 3, Background_history 3 → Background_examination 3

Yes, all five. Therefore, the answer is the Background_examination scores of these five respondents: 2,3,1,3,3. But the output format requires a simple comma-separated list. So the answer would be ""2,3,1,3,3"". However, the example given in the problem had a single answer. But according to the data, there are multiple. Therefore, the correct answer is the list of scores. 

But wait, perhaps the user intended to have only one, and there's a mistake in the data. Alternatively, maybe I misread the data. Let me check each respondent again:

Respondent4: Correct.

Respondent19: Correct.

Respondent21: Correct.

Respondent11: Correct.

Respondent22: Correct.

Yes, all five. Therefore, the answer is a list of their Background_examination scores. So the answer is ""2,3,1,3,3"". But the output rules say to provide a simple comma-separated list. So that's the answer.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Situation of the respondent whose score for 'Situation' was 3 and score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' was 3?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the Situation of the respondent who scored 3 in both 'Situation' and 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)'. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The 'questions' section defines each field. The 'Situation' question is about identifying main problems with a rubric from 0 to 3. The 'Recommendation_clear_recommendation' also uses a rubric from 0 to 3.

Now, looking at the 'responses' section, I need to go through each respondent and check their scores for these two fields. 

Starting with Respondent12: Their Situation is 3, and Recommendation_clear_recommendation is 3. That matches the criteria. The SessionName here is ""II (Anaphylaxis)"". But wait, the question is asking for the Situation, which in this case is the value of the 'Situation' field. Wait, no—the question is phrased as ""What is the Situation of the respondent..."". Wait, maybe I misread. Let me check the task again.

Wait, the task says: ""What is the Situation of the respondent whose score for 'Situation' was 3 and score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' was 3?"" So, the answer should be the value of the 'Situation' field, but since the 'Situation' score is already given as 3, perhaps the question is actually asking for the 'SessionName' of that respondent? Wait, no. Let me re-parse the question. 

Wait, the question is asking for the ""Situation"" of the respondent. But in the data, 'Situation' is a field with a score. However, the 'Situation' in the question might be referring to the actual situation described, but in the data, the 'Situation' is a rubric score. Wait, no. The 'Situation' in the data is a score (0-3) for how well the respondent identified the main problem. The question is asking for the 'Situation' of the respondent, which in the data's context would be the value of the 'Situation' field. But since the question specifies that the score for 'Situation' is 3, and the answer is looking for the 'Situation' of that respondent, perhaps there's confusion here. Wait, maybe the question is actually asking for the 'SessionName' where the respondent scored 3 in both 'Situation' and 'Recommendation_clear_recommendation'? Because the answer in the example was ""2"" for the Assessment, which was a score. But in this case, the answer would be the 'SessionName' of the respondent who meets those scores. Wait, no. Let me check the example again.

In the example, the question was about the Assessment of the respondent from the 'II (Anaphylaxis)' session on '2025-05-04'. The answer was 2, which is the value of the 'Assessment' field for that respondent. So, in this case, the current task is similar: find the respondent who has a 'Situation' score of 3 and a 'Recommendation_clear_recommendation' score of 3, then report their 'Situation' value, which is 3. But that seems redundant. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the 'SessionName' of that respondent. Wait, the question says ""What is the Situation of the respondent..."". The term ""Situation"" here might be a typo, perhaps intending to ask for the 'SessionName'? Or perhaps the 'Situation' here refers to the actual situation (the problem identified), but in the data, the 'Situation' is a rubric score. 

Wait, looking back at the data's questions, the 'Situation' question is ""Identifies the main problem(s). [Rubric: 0-3]"". So the 'Situation' field is a score, not the actual problem. Therefore, the question is asking for the 'Situation' score of the respondent who has 3 in both 'Situation' and 'Recommendation_clear_recommendation'. But that would just be 3, which is already given. That doesn't make sense. There must be a misunderstanding here. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the 'SessionName' of the respondent who scored 3 in both fields. Let me check the data again.

Looking at the respondents:

- Respondent12: Situation=3, Recommendation_clear_recommendation=3. SessionName is ""II (Anaphylaxis)"".
- Respondent14: Situation=3, Recommendation_clear_recommendation=1. Doesn't meet.
- Respondent3: Situation=2. Doesn't meet.
- Respondent11: Situation=3, Recommendation_clear_recommendation=3. SessionName ""IV (AF)"".
- Respondent20: Situation=3, Recommendation_clear_recommendation=2. Doesn't meet.
- Respondent4: Situation=3, Recommendation_clear_recommendation=2. Doesn't meet.
- Respondent10: Situation=2. Doesn't meet.
- Respondent17: Situation=3, Recommendation_clear_recommendation=3. SessionName ""V (Hypoglycemia)"".
- Respondent19: Situation=3, Recommendation_clear_recommendation=3. SessionName ""I - MI"".

Wait, so there are multiple respondents with Situation=3 and Recommendation_clear_recommendation=3: Respondent12, Respondent11, Respondent17, and Respondent19. 

But the question is asking for the ""Situation"" of such a respondent. If ""Situation"" here refers to the SessionName, then the answer would be the SessionNames of these respondents. But the question is singular, implying one answer. However, there are multiple respondents. But looking at the data:

- Respondent12: SessionName ""II (Anaphylaxis)""
- Respondent11: ""IV (AF)""
- Respondent17: ""V (Hypoglycemia)""
- Respondent19: ""I - MI""

But the question is phrased as ""the respondent"", which might imply a single answer. However, there are multiple. This could be a problem. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the 'Situation' score, which is 3, but that's already given. Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick, and the answer is 3. But that seems too straightforward. 

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the 'Situation' field's textual description based on the score. For example, the 'Situation' question's rubric says that a score of 3 means ""Identifies and prioritizes the main problem(s) unprompted"". So the answer would be that description. But according to the output rules, for MCQ fields, we need to map the code to the corresponding option text. The 'Situation' field's rubric is a scale from 0 to 3, each with a description. So if the respondent's 'Situation' score is 3, the answer should be the text corresponding to 3, which is ""Identifies and prioritizes the main problem(s) unprompted"".

But the task is to find the Situation (the textual value) of the respondent who has 3 in both 'Situation' and 'Recommendation_clear_recommendation'. However, the answer would be the same for all such respondents, as they all have Situation=3, so the answer would be the same. But the example in the problem shows that the answer was ""2"" for the Assessment, which was the numerical value. So perhaps the answer here is 3. But that seems conflicting. Wait, the example's answer was ""2"" because the question was about the Assessment score. So in this case, the answer would be the value of the 'Situation' field, which is 3. But the question is phrased as ""What is the Situation..."", which in the data is a score. But according to the output rules, for MCQ fields, we need to output the corresponding text. So the answer should be the text for the score 3 in the 'Situation' question.

Looking back at the 'Situation' question's rubric: ""Identifies and prioritizes the main problem(s) unprompted"". So the answer should be that text. But the output rules say to output the human-readable value, not the code. So for a score of 3, the answer is ""Identifies and prioritizes the main problem(s) unprompted"".

But wait, the example's answer was ""2"", which was the numerical value. But in the example, the question was about the 'Assessment' field, which is a rubric. The answer was ""2"", which is the code. But according to the output rules, for MCQ fields, we should output the corresponding text. However, in the example, the answer was given as ""2"", which is the code. This suggests that perhaps the output should be the code, not the text. But the output rules state that for MCQ fields, we should map the code to the text and output the text. However, the example's answer contradicts that. Let me check the example again.

In the example, the question was: ""What is the Assessment of the respondent from the 'II (Anaphylaxsis)' session on '2025-05-04'?"" The answer given was ""2"". The Assessment field's rubric is 0-3. The correct answer in the data for that respondent (if any) would be the Assessment score. Looking at the data, the respondent with SessionName ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" and Date ""2025-05-04"" is not present. Wait, in the data provided in the example, the respondents are:

Looking at the example's data, the respondents include :Respondent12 with SessionName ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" and Date ""2025-05-02"", and :Respondent17 with Date ""2025-05-04"" but SessionName ""V (Hypoglycemia)"". So perhaps the example's answer is incorrect, or there's a typo. But regardless, the example's answer was ""2"", which is the code. However, according to the output rules, for MCQ fields, the answer should be the text, not the code. But the example's answer is the code. This is conflicting.

Wait, perhaps the output rules have exceptions. Let me recheck the output rules:

- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.

But in the data, the responses are numerical codes (e.g., pred:Situation ""3""). The questions have rubrics with numerical codes. So, in this case, the numerical code in the response corresponds to the textual description in the rubric. Therefore, the output should be the textual description. However, in the example, the answer was ""2"", which is the code, not the text. This suggests that perhaps the output should be the code, not the text. But that contradicts the output rules. This is confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the example's answer is incorrect, or there's a misunderstanding. Let me check the example again. The example's question was about the Assessment of a respondent in a specific session and date. The answer was ""2"". Looking at the data, the respondent with SessionName ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" and Date ""2025-05-04"" doesn't exist. The closest is Respondent12 with Date ""2025-05-02"". But the example's answer is ""2"", which is the code. So perhaps in the example, the answer is the code, not the text. Therefore, perhaps the output should be the code, not the text. But the output rules say to output the text. This is conflicting.

Given this confusion, perhaps the correct approach is to follow the output rules as stated. The output rules say for MCQ fields, output the text corresponding to the code. Therefore, in the current task, the answer should be the text for the 'Situation' score of 3, which is ""Identifies and prioritizes the main problem(s) unprompted"". However, the example's answer was the code, not the text. This inconsistency is problematic.

Alternatively, perhaps the task is to output the code, not the text. But the output rules explicitly state to output the text. Let me recheck the output rules:

- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.

In the data, the responses use numerical codes (e.g., ""3""), and the questions have numerical rubrics. So the code ""3"" maps to the text ""Identifies and prioritizes the main problem(s) unprompted"". Therefore, the answer should be that text. However, the example's answer was ""2"", which is the code, not the text. This suggests that perhaps the output should be the code. But why the discrepancy?

Alternatively, maybe the example is incorrect, and the correct approach is to follow the output rules. Therefore, in the current task, the answer should be the text corresponding to the code 3 for the 'Situation' field, which is ""Identifies and prioritizes the main problem(s) unprompted"".

But the problem is that the question is asking for the ""Situation"" of the respondent. If ""Situation"" refers to the score, then the answer is 3. If it refers to the textual description, then it's the text. But according to the output rules, for MCQ fields, we should output the text. Therefore, the answer should be the text.

However, looking back at the task, the user might have intended to ask for the 'SessionName' of the respondent who meets the criteria. But the question is phrased as ""What is the Situation of the respondent..."". That's ambiguous. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the question, and the intended field is 'SessionName'. But given the question as is, we have to work with it.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the 'Situation' score, which is 3, but the answer should be the code. But according to the output rules, we should output the text. This is confusing.

Given the example's answer was the code, perhaps the intended answer here is the code. But the output rules say to output the text. This is conflicting. To resolve this, perhaps the correct approach is to follow the output rules strictly. Therefore, the answer should be the text corresponding to the code 3 for the 'Situation' field.

But let's look at the respondents who have both 'Situation' 3 and 'Recommendation_clear_recommendation' 3. These are:

- Respondent12: SessionName ""II (Anaphylaxis)""
- Respondent11: ""IV (AF)""
- Respondent17: ""V (Hypoglycemia)""
- Respondent19: ""I - MI""

Each of these has a 'Situation' score of 3, which maps to the text ""Identifies and prioritizes the main problem(s) unprompted"". So the answer would be that text. However, the question is singular, implying one answer. But there are multiple respondents. This suggests that the question might have a mistake, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding it.

Wait, the question is ""What is the Situation of the respondent whose score for 'Situation' was 3 and score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' was 3?"" The answer would be the 'Situation' value for that respondent. But since multiple respondents meet the criteria, the answer would be the same for all of them: ""Identifies and prioritizes the main problem(s) unprompted"". However, the question uses ""the respondent"", which is singular. This suggests that there might be only one respondent meeting the criteria, but according to the data, there are four. This is a problem. 

Alternatively, perhaps the data provided in the current task is different from the example. Let me check the data again.

Looking at the current task's data:

The respondents are:

All four of these have Situation=3 and Recommendation_clear_recommendation=3. Therefore, the answer would be the 'Situation' value for each, which is 3, but according to the output rules, we need to map it to the text. However, the question is singular, so perhaps there's an error in the data or the question. Alternatively, maybe the answer expects all such respondents' SessionNames. But the output rules say for a list, provide a",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Recommendation (global rating scale) of the respondent from the 'II - Anaphylaxsis' session whose Background (history) is higher than the average Background (history) for all sessions on '2025-05-04'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the Recommendation (global rating scale) for a specific respondent. The criteria are: the session is 'II - Anaphylaxsis', the date is '2025-05-04', and their Background (history) score is higher than the average Background history for all sessions on that date.

First, I need to identify all respondents from '2025-05-04'. Looking at the data, there are two respondents on that date: Respondent18 and Respondent5. 

Respondent18 has SessionName ""IV - VT"" and Background_history ""2"". 
Respondent5 has SessionName ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" and Background_history ""3"".

Next, calculate the average Background_history for all sessions on 2025-05-04. The two scores are 2 and 3. The average is (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5. 

Now, check which of these respondents have a Background_history higher than 2.5. Respondent5 has a 3, which is higher. Respondent18 has 2, which is lower. 

So, the target respondent is Respondent5. Now, look at their Recommendation_global_rating_scale. Respondent5's pred:Recommendation_global_rating_scale is ""3"". 

According to the schema, the global rating scale question (QRecommendation_global_rating_scale) has the rubric: 0 = Not at all confident, 1 = Confident but required extended questioning, 2 = Confident but required some further questioning, 3 = Confident and required little or no questioning. 

The value ""3"" corresponds to ""Confident and required little or no questioning"". 

Therefore, the answer should be this text exactly as per the schema.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Recommendation (clear recommendation) of the respondent from the 'IV (VT)' session whose Situation is higher than the average Situation for all sessions on '2025-05-02'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the Recommendation (clear recommendation) of the respondent from the 'IV (VT)' session where their Situation score is higher than the average Situation score for all sessions on '2025-05-02'. 

First, I need to parse the data provided. Let's start by understanding the structure. The data has respondents with various attributes like Date, SessionName, Identification, Situation, etc. The key here is to filter the respondents based on the given criteria.

First, identify all sessions that occurred on '2025-05-02'. Let's look through the responses:

- Respondent1: Date 2025-05-02, SessionName ""V (Hypoglycemia)"", Situation 2
- Respondent16: Date 2025-05-02, SessionName ""I - MI"", Situation 3
- Respondent20: Date 2025-05-02, SessionName ""IV (VT)"", Situation 3

So, there are three respondents on that date. Now, calculate the average Situation score for all sessions on 2025-05-02. The Situation scores are 2, 3, and 3. Adding those: 2 + 3 + 3 = 8. Divided by 3, the average is approximately 2.6667. So, the average Situation score is about 2.67.

Next, we need to find the respondent in the 'IV (VT)' session (note the session name is case-sensitive as per the data) whose Situation score is higher than this average. Looking at the respondents on 2025-05-02 in 'IV (VT)' session: that's Respondent20. Their Situation score is 3, which is higher than 2.67. 

Now, check the Recommendation_clear_recommendation for Respondent20. The value is ""2"". According to the questions schema, QRecommendation_clear_recommendation has the rubric: 0 = No recommendation, 1 = Clear recommendation only after extended questioning, 2 = Clear recommendation after minimal questioning, 3 = Clear comprehensive recommendation without questioning. 

So, the answer should be the text corresponding to ""2"", which is ""Clear recommendation after minimal questioning"".

Clear recommendation after minimal questioning",True
