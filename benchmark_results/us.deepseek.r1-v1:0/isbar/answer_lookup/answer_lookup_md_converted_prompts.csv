<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Identification of the respondent from the 'III-Sepsis' session on '2025-03-14'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the Identification score for the respondent who attended the 'III-Sepsis' session on '2025-03-14'. 

First, I need to look through the responses section. Each respondent has a Date, SessionName, and various scores. The key here is to match both the SessionName and the Date.

Looking at the data:

- Respondent 19: Date 2025-05-16, SessionName I - MI. Not matching.
- Respondent 14: Date 2025-03-14, SessionName IV-Hypoglycemia. Date matches, but session name doesn't.
- Respondent 2: Date 2025-04-04, SessionName MI. Doesn't match.
- Respondent 1: Date 2025-05-02, SessionName V (Hypoglycemia). Nope.
- Respondent 3: Date 2025-04-04, SessionName III-Sepsis. Session matches, but date is April 4th, not March 14th.
- Respondent 7: Date 2025-03-14, SessionName III-Sepsis. Both the date and session name match here. 

So, Respondent 7 is the one we need. Checking their Identification score, it's listed as 3. According to the questions schema, the Identification rubric is 0-3, with 3 meaning ""Introduces themselves and information is complete"". 

Therefore, the answer should be 3.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Background (history) of respondent '14'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question. The task is to find the Background (history) of respondent 14.

First, I need to look at the data provided. The user has given a set of respondents with various details. Each respondent has entries under different categories like Date, SessionName, Identification, Situation, etc. The question specifically asks about the ""Background (history)"" for respondent 14.

Looking at the ""Questions"" section, the Background (history) is scored on a rubric from 0 to 3. The possible scores are defined as:
- 0 = History is unstructured or non-relevant
- 1 = Relevant history but frequent clarification needed
- 2 = Relevant history with few further questions needed
- 3 = Comprehensive focused history

Now, I need to locate respondent 14 in the ""Responses"" section. Scrolling through the list, I find:

### Respondent 14
- **Date:** 2025-03-14
- **SessionName:** IV-Hypoglycemia
- **Identification:** 3
- **Situation:** 3
- **Background (history):** 2
- **Background (examination):** 2
- **Assessment:** 3
- **Recommendation (clear recommendation):** 1
- **Recommendation (global rating scale):** 2
- **Comments:** Time: (2:36-2:53)
Late response for considering consultation

Here, the Background (history) is listed as 2. According to the rubric, a score of 2 corresponds to ""Relevant history with few further questions needed.""

I need to make sure there's no confusion with other respondents or fields. The question is specifically about respondent 14's Background (history), so other entries aren't relevant here. The answer should be the text associated with the score 2 from the rubric, which is exactly as stated above.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the Background (history) of the respondent from the 'I - MI' session on '2025-05-16'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the Background (history) score for the respondent in the 'I - MI' session on '2025-05-16'. 

First, I need to look through the responses to find the entry that matches both the date and the session name. The date given is 2025-05-16, and the session name is 'I - MI'. 

Looking at the list of respondents, Respondent 19 has the date 2025-05-16 and SessionName 'I - MI'. That's the one we need. 

Now, checking the Background (history) field for Respondent 19, the value is 3. According to the questions schema, the Background (history) rubric is:
0 = History is unstructured or non-relevant
1 = Relevant history but frequent clarification needed
2 = Relevant history with few further questions needed
3 = Comprehensive focused history

Since the score is 3, the answer should be ""Comprehensive focused history"".

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Situation of respondent '11'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question. The task is to find the Situation of respondent 11.

First, I need to look at the data provided. The user has given a dataset with multiple respondents, each having various fields like Date, SessionName, Identification, Situation, etc. The questions section defines each field, including the rubric for scoring. 

The Situation field's rubric is:
0 = Unable to identify the main problem(s)
1 = Identifies the main problem(s) after extended prompting
2 = Identifies the main problem(s) with fewer prompts needed
3 = Identifies and prioritizes the main problem(s) unprompted

Now, I need to locate respondent 11 in the responses. Scrolling through the list, here's Respondent 11:

- **Date:** 2025-04-04
- **SessionName:** IV (AF)
- **Identification:** 3
- **Situation:** 3
- **Background (history):** 3
- **Background (examination):** 3
- **Assessment:** 3
- **Recommendation (clear recommendation):** 3
- **Recommendation (global rating scale):** 3
- **Comments:** Clear communication and handover

Looking at the Situation score for respondent 11, it's 3. According to the rubric, a score of 3 means ""Identifies and prioritizes the main problem(s) unprompted"". 

I need to make sure there's no confusion with other respondents. The question specifically asks for respondent 11, so other entries aren't relevant here. The answer should be the text corresponding to the score 3 in the Situation rubric. There's no ambiguity here since the data clearly shows the score is 3. So the answer is ""Identifies and prioritizes the main problem(s) unprompted"".

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Background (examination) of respondent '13'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question. The task is to find the Background (examination) score for respondent 13.

First, I need to look at the provided data. The user mentioned the 'questions' section as the data dictionary, so I should check that to understand what each field means. The Background (examination) is a rubric-based question with scores from 0 to 3. Each score corresponds to a specific description. 

Now, moving to the responses section. I need to locate respondent 13. Let me scan through each respondent entry. 

Looking at the list:
- Respondent 10: Date 2025-03-14, Session (MI)-VT
- Respondent 3: Date 2025-04-04, Session III-Sepsis
- Respondent 8: Date 2025-05-02, Session III (Sepsis)
- Respondent 4: Date 2025-05-16, Session III (Sepsis)
- Respondent 13: Date 2025-03-14, Session I-VF
- Respondent 9: Date 2025-05-04, Session II (Anaphylaxsis)
- Respondent 15: Date 2025-05-04, Session III - Sepsis
- Respondent 12: Date 2025-05-02, Session II (Anaphylaxis)

Found respondent 13. Their Background (examination) is listed as 1. 

According to the rubric for Background (examination), a score of 1 means ""Observations reported but frequent clarification needed"". The output should be the text corresponding to the score, not the number. So the answer is ""Observations reported but frequent clarification needed"".

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").

</output>

<task>
What is the Assessment of respondent '23'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking for the Assessment of respondent 23. First, I need to look at the data provided.

Looking at the Responses section, I need to find Respondent 23. Let me scan through each respondent. Here's Respondent 23:

- **Date:** 2025-03-14
- **SessionName:** II-Anaphylaxsis
- **Identification:** 3
- **Situation:** 3
- **Background (history):** 2
- **Background (examination):** 2
- **Assessment:** 3
- **Recommendation (clear recommendation):** 3
- **Recommendation (global rating scale):** 3
- **Comments:** [some comments]

The question is about the Assessment. The Assessment field here is 3. Now, I need to refer back to the Questions schema to understand what a score of 3 means for the Assessment.

In the Questions section under Assessment, the rubric is:
- 0 = No logical assessment
- 1 = Assessment only after extended questioning
- 2 = Assessment after minimal questioning
- 3 = Comprehensive logical assessment without questioning

So, a score of 3 corresponds to ""Comprehensive logical assessment without questioning"". Therefore, the answer should be that phrase. The user wants the human-readable value, not the number. So the answer is ""Comprehensive logical assessment without questioning"".

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Recommendation (global rating scale) of the respondent from the 'MI' session on '2025-04-04'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the Recommendation (global rating scale) for the respondent from the 'MI' session on '2025-04-04'. 

First, I need to look through the responses to find the correct respondent. The date given is 2025-04-04, and the SessionName is 'MI'. Let me check each respondent in the data.

Looking at Respondent 2: Their Date is 2025-04-04, and SessionName is MI. That matches exactly. Now, under their data, the 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is listed as 1. 

Next, I need to refer back to the questions section to understand what the rubric for this field means. The rubric for the Global Rating Scale (GRS) is:
0 = Not at all confident
1 = Confident but required extended questioning
2 = Confident but required some further questioning
3 = Confident and required little or no questioning

Since the respondent's score is 1, the corresponding description is ""Confident but required extended questioning"". 

I should make sure there are no other respondents with the same date and session name. Checking others: Respondent 11 has the same date but different session (IV (AF)), so that's not it. Only Respondent 2 matches. 

Therefore, the answer is ""Confident but required extended questioning"".

- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the Recommendation (global rating scale) of respondent '9'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the Recommendation (global rating scale) for respondent 9. 

First, I need to locate respondent 9 in the provided data. Looking through the responses, I see that Respondent 9 has the following entry:

- **Date:** 2025-05-04
- **SessionName:** II (Anaphylaxsis)
- **Identification:** 3
- **Situation:** 3
- **Background (history):** 2
- **Background (examination):** 2
- **Assessment:** 2
- **Recommendation (clear recommendation):** 3
- **Recommendation (global rating scale):** 2
- **Comments:** Overall a bit unclear communication reflected

The question specifically asks for the ""Recommendation (global rating scale)"" of this respondent. According to the data, the value here is 2. 

Now, I need to refer back to the questions section to understand what the rubric for the global rating scale is. The rubric states:

- **Recommendation (global rating scale):** Global Rating Scale (GRS) - How confident am I that I received an accurate picture of the patient? [Rubric: 0 = Not at all confident, 1 = Confident but required extended questioning, 2 = Confident but required some further questioning, 3 = Confident and required little or no questioning]

Since respondent 9 scored a 2 on this scale, the corresponding description is ""Confident but required some further questioning"". 

I need to ensure that I'm mapping the numerical value to the correct rubric description. The output should be the text, not the number. The answer here is straightforward once the correct respondent and rubric are identified. There's no ambiguity in the data provided, so the answer should be the text associated with the score 2 in the global rating scale rubric.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Background (examination) of the respondent from the 'II - Anaphylaxsis' session on '2025-05-04'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the Background (examination) score for the respondent who attended the 'II - Anaphylaxsis' session on '2025-05-04'. 

First, I need to look through the responses to find the entry that matches both the date and the session name. The date given is 2025-05-04, and the session name is 'II - Anaphylaxsis'. 

Looking at the list of respondents, I'll start checking each one. 

Respondent 5 has the date 2025-05-04 and SessionName 'II - Anaphylaxsis'. The Background (examination) here is 3. 

Another respondent, number 9, also has the date 2025-05-04 and SessionName 'II (Anaphylaxsis)'. The hyphen vs. parentheses might be a formatting difference, but the session name is essentially the same. Their Background (examination) is 2.

Wait, the task specifies 'II - Anaphylaxsis' with a hyphen. Respondent 5's session is exactly that. Respondent 9's is written as 'II (Anaphylaxsis)'. Are these considered the same session? The question might be referring to either format, but the exact match is with Respondent 5. However, the user might consider both. But the session names are slightly different. Let me check the original data again.

In the example provided, the user had a session named 'II (Anaphylaxsis)' on 2025-05-04, and the answer was 2. But in the current task, the session is 'II - Anaphylaxsis'. However, looking at the current questionnaire data, Respondent 5 has 'II - Anaphylaxsis' on 2025-05-04 with Background (examination) 3. Respondent 9 has the same date but the session name is 'II (Anaphylaxsis)' with Background (examination) 2. 

Wait, the task is asking for 'II - Anaphylaxsis' specifically. So Respondent 5 is the correct one here. Therefore, the answer should be 3. But wait, in the example, the answer was 2, but that was for a different session. Let me make sure I'm not mixing up the example with the current task.

The current task is about 'II - Anaphylaxsis' on 2025-05-04. In the responses, Respondent 5 matches that exact session name and date. Their Background (examination) is 3. So the answer should be 3. But wait, the example had a similar question but different session, and the answer was 2. But here, the correct answer is 3. 

Wait, maybe there's a typo in the session name. Let me check the spelling. The session name in the data for Respondent 5 is 'II - Anaphylaxsis' (with two 's's), which is a common misspelling of Anaphylaxis. But the task uses the same misspelling, so it's a match. Therefore, the Background (examination) is 3. 

But wait, in the current questionnaire data, Respondent 5's Background (examination) is 3. So the answer should be 3. However, I need to confirm again. The task is to find the Background (examination) for the session 'II - Anaphylaxsis' on 2025-05-04. Respondent 5 is the only one with that exact session name and date. Therefore, the answer is 3. 

But wait, the user might have a typo. Let me check again. The session name in the data for Respondent 5 is 'II - Anaphylaxsis' (with 'ss'), and the task is 'II - Anaphylaxsis' (also 'ss'). So it's a match. Therefore, the correct answer is 3.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Assessment of the respondent from the 'IV (AF)' session on '2025-04-04'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The user is asking for the Assessment of the respondent from the 'IV (AF)' session on '2025-04-04'. 

First, I need to look through the provided data to find the correct respondent. Let's start by checking the 'Date' and 'SessionName' fields. The date in question is 2025-04-04, and the session name is IV (AF). 

Looking at the responses, I'll go through each respondent one by one. 

Respondent 3 has a date of 2025-04-04, but their SessionName is III-Sepsis. That's not the one. 

Respondent 2's date is 2025-04-04, but their SessionName is MI. Not matching.

Respondent 11's date is 2025-04-04, and their SessionName is IV (AF). That matches both the date and the session name. 

Now, checking the Assessment field for Respondent 11. The value there is 3. 

Referring back to the questions section, the Assessment rubric says: 3 = Comprehensive logical assessment without questioning. 

So the answer should be the text corresponding to the rubric score 3 for Assessment. The output is ""Comprehensive logical assessment without questioning"".

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Assessment of the respondent from the 'I (Myocardial infarction)' session on '2025-05-16'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the Assessment score for the respondent who attended the 'I (Myocardial infarction)' session on '2025-05-16'. 

First, I need to look through the responses section to find the entry that matches both the date and the session name. Let's start by scanning each respondent's data.

Looking at Respondent 21: Their Date is 2025-05-16, and the SessionName is ""I (Myocardial infarction)"". That's exactly the one we need. Now, checking the Assessment field for this respondent, the value is 2. 

Next, I need to refer back to the questions schema to understand what a score of 2 means for the Assessment. The rubric for Assessment states: 0 = No logical assessment, 1 = Assessment only after extended questioning, 2 = Assessment after minimal questioning, 3 = Comprehensive logical assessment without questioning. 

So, a score of 2 corresponds to ""Assessment after minimal questioning"". The answer should be this exact phrase as per the output rules, without any additional text or codes.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Identification of respondent '15'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the Identification score for respondent 15. 

First, I need to look at the data provided. The user has given a structured dataset with multiple respondents. Each respondent has various fields like Date, SessionName, Identification, Situation, etc. The question specifically asks about respondent 15's Identification.

Looking at the Responses section, I need to locate Respondent 15. Scanning through the list:

- Respondent 21: Date 2025-05-16, Session I (Myocardial infarction)
- Respondent 11: Date 2025-04-04, Session IV (AF)
- Respondent 4: Date 2025-05-16, Session III (Sepsis)
- Respondent 10: Date 2025-03-14, Session (MI)-VT
- Respondent 14: Date 2025-03-14, Session IV-Hypoglycemia
- Respondent 6: Date 2025-04-04, Session II (Anaphylactic Shock)
- Respondent 15: Date 2025-05-04, Session III - Sepsis
- Respondent 1: Date 2025-05-02, Session V (Hypoglycemia)
- Respondent 12: Date 2025-05-02, Session II (Anaphylaxis)

Found Respondent 15. Now, check their Identification value. According to their entry:

- **Identification:** 3

The Identification field uses a rubric where 3 means ""Introduces themselves and information is complete"". The question is asking for the value of Identification, so the answer is 3. However, the output rules state that for MCQ fields, we should map the code to the corresponding text. Wait, but in this case, the rubric is a scale from 0 to 3, each with a description. The output instructions say to provide the human-readable value, not the code. Wait, the output rules mention for MCQ fields to map codes to the option text. Let me check the output rules again.

The output rules state: ""For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both."" However, in this case, the Identification field uses numerical codes (0,1,2,3) with descriptions. The question is whether these numerical codes are considered ""letter codes"" here. The example given in the output rules uses letters (A, B, C), but the Identification field uses numbers. 

Looking back at the original data's Questions section for Identification: 

- **Identification:** [Rubric: 0 = Requires direct prompting, 1 = Introduces themselves but only after a hint, 2 = Introduces themselves but information is incomplete, 3 = Introduces themselves and information is complete]

The output instructions say to provide the human-readable value. However, the user's example in the <example> shows that when the answer is a numerical code (like the Assessment being 2), the output is just the number. Wait, in the example, the question was about the Assessment, and the answer was ""2"". The output was ""2"". But according to the rubric, the Assessment's 2 means ""Assessment after minimal questioning"". However, in the example, the answer was given as the numerical code, not the text. 

Wait, the example's answer was ""Answer: 2"", which is the numerical code. But according to the output rules, for MCQ fields, we should map the code to the text. However, in the example, the answer was given as the code. This is conflicting. Let me check the example again.

In the example, the question was: ""What is the Assessment of the respondent from the 'II (Anaphylaxsis)' session on '2025-05-04'?"" The answer given was ""2"". Looking at the data, the respondent in question (probably Respondent 12, since Session II (Anaphylaxis) on 2025-05-02, but the date in the example is 2025-05-04. Wait, maybe the example is a bit different. Wait, in the example's data, the correct answer was 2, and the output was ""2"". But according to the rubric, the Assessment's 2 is ""Assessment after minimal questioning"". However, the output was the numerical value, not the text. 

This suggests that for numerical rubric scores, the answer is expected to be the numerical value, not the text description. The output rules mention that for MCQ fields with letter codes, map to text, but for numerical codes, perhaps the output is the number. The example's answer was ""2"", which aligns with this. Therefore, in this case, the answer should be the numerical value, not the text. 

But wait, the task here is to provide the human-readable value. The output rules say: ""For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both."" But the Identification field uses numerical codes, not letters. So perhaps in this case, since the code is a number, and the question is asking for the Identification value, the answer is the number. However, the output rules also state: ""If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., '42'). If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., '17, 21, 23'). Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output 'Abnormal', not 'abnormal' or 'A').""

But the question is asking for the Identification of respondent 15, which is a rubric score. The possible answers are 0,1,2,3. The example in the <example> shows that the answer is given as the numerical code. Therefore, the answer here should be the number 3. However, the user's output rules might require mapping to the text. Wait, but the example's answer was 2, which corresponds to the numerical code. Let me check the example again.

In the example, the question was about the Assessment, which uses a rubric with numerical codes. The answer was ""2"", which is the code. Therefore, the correct approach here is to output the numerical code, not the text. Therefore, for respondent 15's Identification, which is 3, the answer is 3. But wait, the user's output rules say: ""For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both."" However, the Identification field uses numerical codes, not letters. Therefore, this rule might not apply here. The Identification is a rubric-based score, not an MCQ with options A, B, C, etc. Therefore, the answer should be the numerical value as per the response. 

But the output rules also state: ""If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., '42')."" However, this is not a count. The question is asking for the value of the Identification field for respondent 15, which is a rubric score. Therefore, the answer is the numerical value provided in the response, which is 3. 

But wait, the user's example had a similar scenario where the answer was a numerical code. The example's answer was ""2"", which was the code. Therefore, following that example, the answer here should be ""3"". 

However, the output instructions also mention: ""Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output 'Abnormal', not 'abnormal' or 'A')."" But in this case, the schema's options are numerical codes with descriptions, not textual options. Therefore, the answer should be the numerical code. 

Thus, the answer is 3.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Background (history) of the respondent from the '(MI)-VT' session on '2025-03-14'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the Background (history) score for the respondent in the '(MI)-VT' session on '2025-03-14'. 

First, I need to look through the responses to find the correct respondent. The key identifiers here are the SessionName '(MI)-VT' and the date '2025-03-14'. 

Looking at the Responses section, I'll go through each respondent one by one. 

Starting with Respondent 17: Their SessionName is V (Hypoglycemia) and the date is 2025-05-04. Not a match.

Respondent 6: SessionName II (Anaphylactic Shock) on 2025-04-04. Nope.

Respondent 23: SessionName II-Anaphylaxsis on 2025-03-14. Close date, but session name doesn't match.

Respondent 4: SessionName III (Sepsis) on 2025-05-16. Not it.

Respondent 10: Here we go. Their SessionName is (MI)-VT and the date is 2025-03-14. That's exactly the criteria we need. 

Now, checking the Background (history) field for Respondent 10. The value listed is 2. 

According to the Questions section, the Background (history) rubric is:
0 = History is unstructured or non-relevant
1 = Relevant history but frequent clarification needed
2 = Relevant history with few further questions needed
3 = Comprehensive focused history

So a score of 2 corresponds to ""Relevant history with few further questions needed"". 

I need to make sure there's no other respondent with the same session and date. Scanning through the rest: Respondent 21, 7, 5, 22—none of them have the '(MI)-VT' session on 2025-03-14. 

Therefore, the answer is the rubric text for 2 in Background (history), which is ""Relevant history with few further questions needed"".

<task>
What is the Situation of the respondent from the 'IV (VT)' session on '2025-05-02'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the Situation score for the respondent who attended the 'IV (VT)' session on '2025-05-02'. 

First, I need to look through the responses to find the entry that matches both the date and the session name. The date given is 2025-05-02, and the session name is 'IV (VT)'. 

Looking at the responses, I'll go through each respondent one by one. 

Starting with Respondent 18: Their date is 2025-05-04 and SessionName is IV - VT. The date doesn't match, so move on.

Respondent 17: Date is 2025-05-04, SessionName V (Hypoglycemia). Not a match.

Respondent 1: Date 2025-05-02, SessionName V (Hypoglycemia). Date matches, but session name doesn't.

Respondent 20: Date is 2025-05-02, SessionName IV (VT). This matches both the date and the session name. The Situation score here is 3. 

Wait, but let me check the other respondents to be sure. 

Respondent 11: Date is 2025-04-04, so no. Respondent 16: Date 2025-05-02, SessionName I - MI. Not matching. Respondent 21: Date is 2025-05-16, so no. 

So the only matching entry is Respondent 20. Now, looking at the Situation rubric: the score is 3, which according to the questions section means ""Identifies and prioritizes the main problem(s) unprompted"". 

Therefore, the answer should be the text corresponding to a score of 3 in the Situation category. The output should be the text, not the number. So the answer is ""Identifies and prioritizes the main problem(s) unprompted"".

</output>

<task>
What is the Identification of respondent '18'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the Identification score for Respondent 18. 

First, I need to look at the data provided. The user has given a structured dataset with multiple respondents. Each respondent has various scores and comments. The question is specifically about Respondent 18's Identification.

Looking at the Responses section, I need to locate Respondent 18. Let me scan through each respondent entry. 

Here's the list of respondents provided:
- Respondent 16
- Respondent 3
- Respondent 18
- Respondent 5
- Respondent 20
- Respondent 23

Found Respondent 18. Now, checking their data:

- **Date:** 2025-05-04
- **SessionName:** IV - VT
- **Identification:** 3
- **Situation:** 3
- **Background (history):** 2
- **Background (examination):** 2
- **Assessment:** 3
- **Recommendation (clear recommendation):** 2
- **Recommendation (global rating scale):** 2
- **Comments:** Not very concise or clear communication
Satisfactory

The Identification field here is 3. Now, according to the Questions schema, the Identification rubric is:

- 0 = Requires direct prompting
- 1 = Introduces themselves but only after a hint
- 2 = Introduces themselves but information is incomplete
- 3 = Introduces themselves and information is complete

So, a score of 3 corresponds to ""Introduces themselves and information is complete"". Therefore, the answer should be the text description for the value 3 in the Identification rubric. The output should not include the number, just the text. 

I need to make sure there's no confusion with other respondents or fields. The task is straightforward here since Respondent 18's Identification is clearly 3, and the mapping is direct from the rubric. No other respondents are involved in this specific query. Also, checking if there's any possibility of a typo or misinterpretation, but the data seems clear. The answer is the text associated with 3 in the Identification rubric.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Recommendation (global rating scale) of the respondent from the 'IV (VT)' session on '2025-05-02'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the Recommendation (global rating scale) for the respondent from the 'IV (VT)' session on '2025-05-02'. 

First, I need to look through the responses to find the entry that matches both the date and the session name. The date given is 2025-05-02, and the session name is 'IV (VT)'. 

Looking at the responses, each respondent has a Date and SessionName. Let's go through them one by one.

Respondent 9: Date is 2025-05-04, SessionName II (Anaphylaxsis) – not a match.
Respondent 17: 2025-05-04, V (Hypoglycemia) – nope.
Respondent 20: Date is 2025-05-02, SessionName IV (VT). This looks like a match. Let's check the details. The Recommendation (global rating scale) here is 3. According to the rubric, 3 means ""Confident and required little or no questioning"". 

Wait, but I need to make sure there's no other respondent with the same date and session. Let me check the others. Respondent 14: 2025-03-14, IV-Hypoglycemia. Respondent 7: 2025-03-14. Respondent 18: 2025-05-04, IV - VT. Respondent 19: 2025-05-16. So only Respondent 20 matches both the date and session name. 

The answer should be the value corresponding to 3 in the global rating scale, which is ""Confident and required little or no questioning"".

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Background (history) of respondent '8'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question. The task is to find the Background (history) of respondent 8.

First, I need to look at the data provided. The user mentioned a questionnaire with responses from various respondents. Let me check the ""Responses"" section.

Looking through the respondents, I need to find Respondent 8. Here's the entry for Respondent 8:

- **Date:** 2025-05-02
- **SessionName:** III (Sepsis)
- **Identification:** 3
- **Situation:** 3
- **Background (history):** 3
- **Background (examination):** 2
- **Assessment:** 2
- **Recommendation (clear recommendation):** 2
- **Recommendation (global rating scale):** 3
- **Comments:** Clear communication during handover Good

So, under ""Background (history)"" for Respondent 8, the value is 3. Now, I need to refer back to the Questions section to understand what a score of 3 means for the Background (history) question.

The Questions section says:
- **Background (history):** Gives appropriate history. [Rubric: 0 = History is unstructured or non-relevant, 1 = Relevant history but frequent clarification needed, 2 = Relevant history with few further questions needed, 3 = Comprehensive focused history]

So, a score of 3 corresponds to ""Comprehensive focused history"". Therefore, the answer should be ""Comprehensive focused history"".

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Recommendation (clear recommendation) of respondent '5'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question. The task is to find the ""Recommendation (clear recommendation)"" for respondent 5. 

First, I need to look at the data provided. The user has given a dataset with multiple respondents, each identified by a number. The key is to locate respondent 5 in the responses section.

Looking through the responses, I see there's a Respondent 5 listed. Their entry has several fields. The question specifically asks for the ""Recommendation (clear recommendation)"" which is a rubric-based score. According to the questions section, the rubric for this field is:
- 0 = No recommendation
- 1 = Clear recommendation only after extended questioning
- 2 = Clear recommendation after minimal questioning
- 3 = Clear comprehensive recommendation without questioning

Now, checking Respondent 5's data, under ""Recommendation (clear recommendation):"" the value is 2. According to the rubric, a score of 2 corresponds to ""Clear recommendation after minimal questioning"". 

I need to make sure there's no confusion with other respondents. Let me double-check. Yes, Respondent 5's entry is correct. The answer should be the text corresponding to the score 2, which is ""Clear recommendation after minimal questioning"".

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Background (examination) of the respondent from the 'IV (AF)' session on '2025-04-04'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking for the Background (examination) of the respondent from the 'IV (AF)' session on '2025-04-04'. 

First, I need to look at the data provided. The responses are listed under different respondents. Each respondent has a Date, SessionName, and various scores.

The key here is to find the respondent who has the SessionName 'IV (AF)' and the Date '2025-04-04'. Let me go through each respondent one by one.

Looking at Respondent 2: Their SessionName is MI and Date is 2025-04-04. Not the right session.

Respondent 13: SessionName I-VF, Date 2025-03-14. Not matching.

Respondent 11: SessionName IV (AF), Date 2025-04-04. That's the one! Now, check their Background (examination) score. The value here is 3. 

Now, referring back to the questions section, the Background (examination) rubric says that a score of 3 means ""Comprehensive focused examination/observations"". So the answer should be that phrase. 

I need to make sure there's no other respondent with the same session and date. The other respondents have different SessionNames or dates. So Respondent 11 is the correct one. The answer is their Background (examination) score mapped to the rubric.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Assessment of the respondent with the highest Recommendation (global rating scale) in the 'IV-Hypoglycemia' session?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the Assessment of the respondent with the highest Recommendation (global rating scale) in the 'IV-Hypoglycemia' session. 

First, I need to look through all the responses to identify which ones are part of the 'IV-Hypoglycemia' session. Let me go through each respondent's data.

Looking at the responses:

- Respondent 14 has SessionName ""IV-Hypoglycemia"" with Date 2025-03-14. Their Recommendation (global rating scale) is 2. The Assessment here is 3.

Other respondents have different SessionNames like IV - VT, III - Sepsis, II - Anaphylaxsis, etc. So only Respondent 14 is in the 'IV-Hypoglycemia' session. 

Since there's only one respondent in that session, the highest global rating scale is 2. The Assessment for Respondent 14 is 3. According to the rubric for Assessment, a score of 3 means ""Comprehensive logical assessment without questioning.""

So the answer should be the text corresponding to Assessment score 3.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Background (history) of the respondent whose total score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and 'Assessment' was exactly 4?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the Background (history) score of the respondent whose total score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and 'Assessment' adds up exactly to 4. 

First, I need to look through each respondent's data and calculate the sum of their 'Assessment' and 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' scores. Then, check which one equals 4. Once identified, I'll note their Background (history) score.

Starting with Respondent 8: Assessment is 2, Recommendation (clear recommendation) is 2. 2+2=4. That's a total of 4. So their Background (history) is 3. But wait, the question asks for the Background (history) of the respondent where the sum is exactly 4. So this could be the one. Let me check others to confirm.

Respondent 6: Assessment 2, Recommendation 2. 2+2=4. Their Background (history) is 3. So another candidate. Wait, but the question says ""the respondent"", implying singular. Are there multiple? Let me check all.

Respondent 14: Assessment 3, Recommendation 1. 3+1=4. So that's another total of 4. Their Background (history) is 2. 

Respondent 16: Assessment 3, Recommendation 2. 3+2=5. Not 4.

Respondent 20: Assessment 3, Recommendation 2. 5 again. 

Respondent 7: Assessment 2, Recommendation 2. 4. Their Background (history) is 2.

So there are three respondents (8, 6, 14, 7) with total 4. Wait, no: Respondent 8: 2+2=4. Respondent 6: 2+2=4. Respondent 14: 3+1=4. Respondent 7: 2+2=4. So four respondents. But the question says ""the respondent"", which might be a mistake, but perhaps the data has only one. Wait, let me recount:

Looking at each:

- Respondent 8: Assessment 2, Rec 2 → 4. Background (history) 3.
- Respondent 6: Assessment 2, Rec 2 → 4. Background (history) 3.
- Respondent 14: Assessment 3, Rec 1 → 4. Background (history) 2.
- Respondent 7: Assessment 2, Rec 2 → 4. Background (history) 2.

So four respondents have a total of 4. But the question asks for ""the respondent"", which might be a typo, but according to the data, there are multiple. However, the answer might require all of them. Wait, the task says ""the respondent whose total..."", but the data shows multiple. The answer should list all their Background (history) scores. But the output rules say if it's a list, provide a comma-separated list. However, the question is phrased as ""What is the Background (history) of the respondent..."", which might expect a single answer. But according to the data, there are multiple. Let me check again.

Wait, the question is: ""What is the Background (history) of the respondent whose total score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and 'Assessment' was exactly 4?""

So if multiple respondents meet the criteria, we need to list all their Background (history) scores. Let's check each:

Respondent 8: Background (history) 3.

Respondent 6: Background (history) 3.

Respondent 14: Background (history) 2.

Respondent 7: Background (history) 2.

So the answer would be 3, 3, 2, 2. But the output rules say if it's a list, provide a comma-separated list. However, the question might have intended a single answer, but according to the data, there are four. But looking back at the data provided in the questionnaire section, let me verify:

Looking at the data again:

Respondent 8: Assessment 2, Rec 2 → sum 4. Background (history) 3.

Respondent 6: same, sum 4. Background 3.

Respondent 14: sum 4. Background 2.

Respondent 7: sum 4. Background 2.

So four respondents. Therefore, the answer should be 3,3,2,2. But the output rules say to provide the exact value. Wait, but the question is phrased as ""the respondent"", which is singular. Maybe there's a mistake in the data or the question. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me check each again.

Wait, in the data provided, the respondents are:

Respondent 8: sum 4 (2+2), Background 3.

Respondent 6: sum 4 (2+2), Background 3.

Respondent 14: sum 4 (3+1), Background 2.

Respondent 7: sum 4 (2+2), Background 2.

So four respondents. Therefore, the answer would be the Background (history) scores for all these respondents. But the output instructions say if the question asks for a list, provide a comma-separated list. So the answer would be 3,3,2,2. However, looking at the example given in the problem, the answer was ""2"" for a similar question, which was singular. But in that example, there was only one respondent matching the criteria. Here, there are multiple. So the correct approach is to list all of them. Therefore, the answer is 3,3,2,2. But let me check again to ensure I didn't miss any.

Wait, in the data, Respondent 14's 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' is 1, and Assessment is 3. 1+3=4. So that's correct. Respondent 7: 2+2=4. Correct. So four respondents. Therefore, the answer is 3,3,2,2. But the output rules say to provide the human-readable value. Wait, the Background (history) is a rubric score (0-3), so the answer is the numerical values. The question asks for the Background (history) of the respondent(s) with the total 4. So the answer is the scores 3,3,2,2. But the output format says to provide the exact text value. Wait, the Background (history) is a rubric score, so the answer is the numerical values. The output rules state for MCQ fields to map to the text, but Background (history) is a rubric with numerical scores. Wait, looking at the questions section:

For example, the 'Identification' field has a rubric with 0-3. The 'Background (history)' is a rubric with 0-3. So the responses are numerical scores. The question is asking for the value of 'Background (history)' which is a numerical score. So the answer is the numerical value(s). 

Therefore, the respondents with total 4 in Assessment and Recommendation (clear recommendation) are:

Respondent 8: 3

Respondent 6: 3

Respondent 14: 2

Respondent 7: 2

So the answer is 3,3,2,2. But the output rules say if the question asks for a list, provide a comma-separated list. So the answer should be ""3,3,2,2"". However, the example in the problem had a single answer. But in this case, there are multiple. Therefore, the correct answer is the list of these scores.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the Identification of the respondent whose score for 'Situation' was 3 and score for 'Assessment' was 3?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the Identification score of the respondent who has a Situation score of 3 and an Assessment score of 3. 

First, I need to look through all the respondents in the provided data. Let me go through each one by one.

Starting with Respondent 5: Their Situation is 3, Assessment is 3. Identification is 3. So this one matches both criteria. But I should check others to see if there are more.

Respondent 7: Situation 3, but Assessment is 2. Doesn't meet both.

Respondent 10: Situation 2, Assessment 2. Nope.

Respondent 22: Situation 3, Assessment 2. No.

Respondent 2: Situation 3, Assessment 3. Identification is 3. Another match.

Respondent 18: Situation 3, Assessment 3. Identification 3. Third match.

Respondent 19: Situation 3, Assessment 2. No.

Respondent 11: Situation 3, Assessment 3. Identification 3. Fourth match.

Respondent 1: Situation 2. Doesn't qualify.

Respondent 15: Situation 3, Assessment 2. No.

Respondent 21: Situation 2. No.

Respondent 8: Situation 3, Assessment 2. No.

Wait, so the respondents that meet both Situation 3 and Assessment 3 are Respondent 5, 2, 18, and 11. Each of these has Identification score 3. The question asks for the Identification of the respondent(s) meeting those criteria. Since the answer format requires a human-readable value, and all four have Identification 3, which according to the rubric is ""Introduces themselves and information is complete"". So the answer should be ""3"" converted to the corresponding text. Wait, no. Wait, the Identification field's rubric is a numerical score. The question is asking for the Identification score, which is the numerical value. Wait, the task says ""What is the Identification of the respondent..."". The Identification is a rubric score (0-3). The output rules say for MCQ fields, map codes to text. But in the data, Identification is a numerical value (0-3). Wait, looking at the schema for Identification: it's a rubric with numerical scores. The output rules state that for MCQ fields, map any letter codes to the corresponding text. But here, the responses are numbers. So perhaps the answer should be the numerical value, but according to the output rules, if it's an MCQ field, we need to map the code to the text. Wait, the Identification field's rubric is [Rubric: 0 = ..., 3 = ...]. So the possible values are 0,1,2,3. The responses are numbers. The output rules say for MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the responses to the corresponding option text. But here, the responses are numbers, not letters. So perhaps the answer should be the text corresponding to the numerical code. For example, if the response is 3, the text is ""Introduces themselves and information is complete"". But the output rules say to output the human-readable value, not the code. So in this case, the answer should be the text description for the Identification score of 3. Let me check the schema again. The Identification rubric is: 0 = Requires direct prompting, 1 = Introduces themselves but only after a hint, 2 = Introduces themselves but information is incomplete, 3 = Introduces themselves and information is complete. So if the respondent's Identification is 3, the answer should be ""Introduces themselves and information is complete"". But the task is asking for the Identification of the respondent(s) who have Situation 3 and Assessment 3. So the answer would be the text corresponding to their Identification score. However, looking at the example provided in the user's message, the answer was ""2"" for the Assessment. But in that example, the answer was a numerical value. Wait, in the example, the question was about the Assessment, and the answer was ""2"", which is the numerical value. But according to the output rules, for MCQ fields, the answer should be the text. But in the example, the answer was given as ""2"", which is the numerical code, not the text. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me check the example again. The example question was: ""What is the Assessment of the respondent from the 'II (Anaphylaxsis)' session on '2025-05-04'?"" The answer given was ""2"". But according to the schema, the Assessment rubric is 0-3. The correct answer in the example was ""2"", which is the numerical value. But according to the output rules, for MCQ fields, the answer should be the text. However, in the example, the answer was the numerical code. This suggests that perhaps the output should be the numerical value, not the text. Wait, the output rules state: ""For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both."" But in the data, the responses are numerical codes, not letters. So perhaps in this case, since the responses are numerical and the schema uses numerical codes, the answer is the numerical value. Because the output rules only mention mapping letter codes to text. So if the response is a number, and the schema uses numbers, then output the number. But the output rules also say ""Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output 'Abnormal', not 'abnormal' or 'A')"". But in this case, the schema's options are numerical with text descriptions. So perhaps the answer should be the numerical value. Because the example answer was ""2"", which is the numerical code. Therefore, in this task, the answer is the numerical value of the Identification for the respondents who have Situation 3 and Assessment 3. So the respondents with Situation 3 and Assessment 3 are: Respondent 5 (3), Respondent 2 (3), Respondent 18 (3), Respondent 11 (3). All have Identification 3. So the answer is 3. But the question is asking for the Identification of the respondent(s) - plural? The task says ""the respondent"", but there might be multiple. However, the answer should list all of them. Wait, the task says ""the respondent"" (singular), but there are multiple. So perhaps the answer is 3, as all qualifying respondents have Identification 3. Therefore, the answer is 3. But according to the output rules, if it's an MCQ field, map the code to the text. But the example answer was a numerical code. So perhaps the answer is the numerical value. Therefore, the answer is 3.

<task>
What is the Identification of the respondent whose total score for 'Assessment' and 'Background (history)' was exactly 5?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the Identification of the respondent whose total score for 'Assessment' and 'Background (history)' adds up exactly to 5. 

First, I need to recall the structure of the data provided. The responses section lists multiple respondents with various scores. Each respondent has an 'Assessment' score and a 'Background (history)' score. The Identification is another field, but the question is asking for the Identification value of the person where the sum of Assessment and Background (history) is 5.

So, I need to go through each respondent and check their Assessment and Background (history) scores. Let's start listing them out:

Looking at Respondent 17:
- Assessment: 3
- Background (history): 3
Sum: 3 + 3 = 6 → Not 5.

Respondent 6:
- Assessment: 2
- Background (history): 3
Sum: 2 + 3 = 5 → This adds up to 5. So their Identification is 3. But wait, the question is asking for the Identification value. However, the answer might be this respondent, but let's check others to be sure.

Respondent 2:
- Assessment: 3
- Background (history): 2
Sum: 3 + 2 = 5 → Also 5. Their Identification is 3. So now there are two respondents? Wait, but the data might have more.

Wait, let me check all respondents to ensure I don't miss any.

Respondent 23:
- Assessment: 3
- Background (history): 2
Sum: 5. Identification is 3. So that's another one.

Wait, but the question says ""the respondent"" in singular. Are there multiple? Let me check all entries.

Continuing:

Respondent 3:
- Assessment: 3
- Background (history): 3 → Sum 6.

Respondent 22:
- Assessment: 2
- Background (history): 3 → Sum 5. Identification 3. Another one.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me list all respondents with their scores:

1. Respondent 17: 3 +3=6
2. Respondent 6: 2+3=5 → Sum 5
3. Respondent 2: 3+2=5 → Sum 5
4. Respondent 23:3+2=5 → Sum 5
5. Respondent 3:3+3=6
6. Respondent 22:2+3=5 → Sum 5
7. Respondent 19:2+3=5 → Sum 5
8. Respondent 20:3+2=5 → Sum 5
9. Respondent 11:3+3=6
10. Respondent 14:3+2=5 → Sum 5
11. Respondent 4:2+3=5 → Sum 5
12. Respondent 7:2+2=4 → Sum 4

Wait, this can't be right. Let me check each again carefully.

Wait, the 'Background (history)' for each respondent:

Looking back:

Respondent 6: Background (history): 3. Assessment:2. 3+2=5. Correct.

Respondent 2: Background (history):2. Assessment:3. 2+3=5. Correct.

Respondent 23: Background (history):2. Assessment:3. 2+3=5. Correct.

Respondent 22: Assessment:2, Background (history):3. 2+3=5. Correct.

Respondent 19: Assessment:2, Background (history):3. 2+3=5. Correct.

Respondent 20: Background (history):2. Assessment:3. 2+3=5. Correct.

Respondent 14: Background (history):2. Assessment:3. 2+3=5. Correct.

Respondent 4: Assessment:2, Background (history):3. 2+3=5. Correct.

Wait, so that's multiple respondents. But the question says ""the respondent"" (singular). But according to the data, there are several respondents where the sum is 5. However, maybe I made a mistake in reading their scores. Let me verify each one again.

Let me go through each respondent one by one:

Respondent 6:
- Background (history):3
- Assessment:2
Sum:5. Correct.

Respondent 2:
- Background (history):2
- Assessment:3
Sum:5. Correct.

Respondent 23:
- Background (history):2
- Assessment:3
Sum:5. Correct.

Respondent 22:
- Background (history):3
- Assessment:2
Sum:5. Correct.

Respondent 19:
- Background (history):3
- Assessment:2
Sum:5. Correct.

Respondent 20:
- Background (history):2
- Assessment:3
Sum:5. Correct.

Respondent 14:
- Background (history):2
- Assessment:3
Sum:5. Correct.

Respondent 4:
- Background (history):3
- Assessment:2
Sum:5. Correct.

So that's 8 respondents with sum 5. But the question is asking for the Identification of the respondent(s) where the sum is exactly 5. However, all these respondents have Identification:3 except for Respondent 3, who isn't part of the sum 5 group. Wait, no, Respondent 3's sum is 6. So all the respondents with sum 5 have Identification:3. But the question is asking for the Identification value. If all of them have Identification 3, then the answer is 3. But wait, the question is phrased as ""the respondent"" which might imply a single respondent, but the data shows multiple. However, the answer is the Identification value, which is 3 for all of them. So the answer is 3. But let me check again if any of the respondents with sum 5 have a different Identification.

Looking at all the respondents in the list:

Respondent 6: Identification 3
Respondent 2: 3
Respondent 23:3
Respondent 22:3
Respondent 19:3
Respondent 20:3
Respondent 14:3
Respondent 4:3

All of them have Identification 3. So regardless of which respondent, the Identification is 3. Therefore, the answer is 3.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Assessment of the respondent whose score for 'Background (history)' was 2 and score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' was 2?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the Assessment score for a respondent who has a Background (history) score of 2 and a Recommendation (clear recommendation) score of 2. 

First, I need to look through all the respondents in the provided data. Let me go through each one:

Starting with Respondent 7: Background (history) is 2, but their Recommendation (clear recommendation) is 2. Wait, that matches both criteria. But the question is asking for the Assessment score of such a respondent. So Respondent 7's Assessment is 2. But let me check others to make sure there's not another respondent with the same scores.

Next, Respondent 22: Background (history) is 3, so doesn't match. 

Respondent 11: Background (history) is 3, so no.

Respondent 8: Background (history) is 3, so no.

Respondent 9: Background (history) is 2, and Recommendation (clear recommendation) is 3. So that doesn't match.

Respondent 13: Background (history) is 2, and Recommendation (clear recommendation) is 2. So their Assessment is 2. Wait, so both Respondent 7 and 13 have these scores. But the question is asking for the Assessment of the respondent(s) with those two scores. However, the answer might be multiple, but the example given in the problem had a single answer. Let me check if there are more.

Respondent 5: Background (history) is 3, so no.

Respondent 10: Background (history) is 2, and Recommendation (clear recommendation) is 2. So their Assessment is 2. Now that's a third respondent. Wait, but looking at the data:

Wait, let me list all respondents with Background (history) = 2 and Recommendation (clear recommendation) = 2:

- Respondent 7: Assessment 2
- Respondent 13: Assessment 2
- Respondent 10: Assessment 2
- Respondent 6: Background (history) is 3, so no.

Wait, Respondent 10's Background (history) is 2? Let me check again. Yes, Respondent 10's Background (history) is 2, and Recommendation (clear recommendation) is 2. So their Assessment is 2. So there are three respondents meeting the criteria. But the example answer was a single number. However, the task might have multiple correct answers, but the output format requires a single value. Wait, but maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, let me recheck each respondent:

Respondent 7: Background (history) = 2, Recommendation (clear recommendation) = 2 → Assessment = 2.

Respondent 13: Same → Assessment = 2.

Respondent 10: Same → Assessment = 2.

Wait, but the question is asking for ""the respondent"" (singular), but there are multiple. However, perhaps the data has only one such respondent. Wait, let me check again.

Looking at the data:

Respondent 7: Date 2025-03-14, Session III-Sepsis. Background (history) 2, Recommendation (clear) 2. Assessment 2.

Respondent 13: Date 2025-03-14, Session I-VF. Background (history) 2, Recommendation (clear) 2. Assessment 2.

Respondent 10: Date 2025-03-14, Session (MI)-VT. Background (history) 2, Recommendation (clear) 2. Assessment 2.

So three respondents meet the criteria. But the example answer in the previous question was a single value. However, the current task might have multiple correct answers. But the output rules say to provide the answer directly. If there are multiple, perhaps list them. But the output rules mention for a list of names or IDs, provide a comma-separated list. But the question is asking for the Assessment score, not the respondent IDs. Wait, the question is: What is the Assessment of the respondent(s) who meet these criteria. If multiple respondents have the same Assessment score, then the answer is that score. But if they have different scores, then we need to list all. But in this case, all three have Assessment 2. So the answer is 2. But let me check again.

Wait, Respondent 7: Assessment 2.

Respondent 13: Assessment 2.

Respondent 10: Assessment 2.

So all three have Assessment 2. Therefore, the answer is 2. But the example in the problem had a single answer, but that's because there was only one respondent matching the date and session. Here, there are multiple, but the question is about the Assessment score(s) of those respondents. Since all three have the same score, the answer is 2.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Recommendation (global rating scale) of the respondent with the highest Background (history) in the 'III - Sepsis' session?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the Recommendation (global rating scale) of the respondent with the highest Background (history) in the 'III - Sepsis' session.

First, I need to identify all respondents who participated in the 'III - Sepsis' session. Looking through the responses:

- Respondent 15: SessionName is ""III - Sepsis""
- Respondent 4: SessionName is ""III (Sepsis)""
- Respondent 3: SessionName is ""III-Sepsis""
- Respondent 7: SessionName is ""III-Sepsis""

The session names have slight variations in formatting (like hyphens and parentheses), but they all refer to the same session ""III - Sepsis"". So, all these respondents are part of the same session.

Next, I need to check their Background (history) scores. The Background (history) rubric is from 0 to 3. Let's list them:

- Respondent 15: Background (history) = 2
- Respondent 4: Background (history) = 3
- Respondent 3: Background (history) = 3
- Respondent 7: Background (history) = 2

So, the highest Background (history) scores here are 3, achieved by Respondents 4 and 3. Now, among these two, we need to determine which one has the highest. Since both have the same score, but the question asks for the respondent with the highest. If there's a tie, perhaps we need to look for other criteria, but the question doesn't specify. However, the question is asking for the Recommendation (global rating scale) of the respondent with the highest Background (history). Since both have the same highest score, we need to check their global rating scales.

Looking at their Recommendation (global rating scale):

- Respondent 4: 2
- Respondent 3: 3

So, Respondent 3 has a higher global rating scale. But wait, the question is asking for the global rating scale of the respondent with the highest Background (history). Since both have the highest Background (history) score of 3, but the question might be looking for the highest among them. However, the task is to find the global rating scale of that respondent. If there are multiple respondents with the highest Background (history), do we need to list all their global ratings? But the output format says to provide a simple answer. Let me check the question again: ""the respondent with the highest Background (history)"". If there's a tie, perhaps both are considered, but the answer expects a single value. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me recheck the data.

Wait, Respondent 3's SessionName is ""III-Sepsis"" and the date is 2025-04-04. Respondent 4's SessionName is ""III (Sepsis)"" on 2025-05-16. The session name variations are likely considered the same. So both have Background (history) of 3. Therefore, the highest is 3, and there are two respondents. But the question is asking for the global rating scale of the respondent with the highest Background (history). If there are multiple, perhaps the answer is the highest among them. But the question is about the respondent's global rating, not the highest. So, each of those respondents has their own global rating. But the question is singular: ""the respondent"". Hmm, maybe I need to check if there's a mistake in the data.

Wait, let me check again. The task is: ""What is the Recommendation (global rating scale) of the respondent with the highest Background (history) in the 'III - Sepsis' session?""

So, first, filter all respondents in 'III - Sepsis' (any variation), then find the one with the highest Background (history) score. If multiple, then their global rating scales. But the answer expects a single value. Let me check the data again.

Respondent 3: Background (history) 3, Global Rating Scale 3.

Respondent 4: Background (history) 3, Global Rating Scale 2.

So, the highest Background (history) is 3, and among those, the highest global rating is 3 (Respondent 3). But the question is asking for the global rating of the respondent with the highest Background (history). If there are multiple respondents with the same highest Background (history), do we take the maximum of their global ratings? Or is there a single respondent? The question says ""the respondent"", implying singular. But in the data, there are two respondents (3 and 4) with Background (history) 3. However, looking at the SessionName for Respondent 3: ""III-Sepsis"" and date 2025-04-04. Respondent 4's SessionName is ""III (Sepsis)"" on 2025-05-16. Are these considered the same session? The original question specifies 'III - Sepsis' session. The variations in the SessionName (with hyphen, parentheses, etc.) might be considered the same session. So, both are part of 'III - Sepsis' sessions. Therefore, both have the highest Background (history) of 3. But the question is asking for the global rating scale of that respondent. If there are two, but the answer expects a single value, perhaps the answer is 3 (from Respondent 3) and 2 (from Respondent 4). But the question is singular. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again.

Wait, the task is to find the global rating scale of the respondent with the highest Background (history) in the 'III - Sepsis' session. So, among all respondents in that session, find the one with the highest Background (history) score, then report their global rating. If there's a tie, perhaps both are considered, but the answer format expects a single value. However, the output rules say for a list, provide a comma-separated list. But the question is phrased as ""the respondent"", which is singular. But in the data, there are two respondents (3 and 4) with the highest Background (history) of 3. Therefore, the answer should include both their global ratings. But the output rules say if the question asks for a list, provide a simple comma-separated list. However, the question is asking for the Recommendation (global rating scale) of the respondent(s) with the highest Background (history). So, the answer would be 3 and 2. But let me check the output rules again. The output rules state: ""If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list"". Here, the question is asking for the global rating scale value(s). If there are multiple respondents, the answer would be multiple values. But the output example for a count is a number, and for a list, it's a comma-separated list. However, the question is not asking for a list but a single value. Wait, perhaps I need to check if there's a mistake in the data interpretation.

Wait, let's re-examine the respondents:

Respondent 3: SessionName ""III-Sepsis"", Date 2025-04-04, Background (history) 3, Global Rating 3.

Respondent 4: SessionName ""III (Sepsis)"", Date 2025-05-16, Background (history) 3, Global Rating 2.

The original question specifies the session as 'III - Sepsis'. The variations in the SessionName (hyphen vs. parentheses) might be considered the same session. So both are part of the same session. Therefore, the highest Background (history) is 3, achieved by both. Therefore, their global ratings are 3 and 2. But the question is asking for the global rating of the respondent with the highest Background (history). If there are two, the answer would be both 3 and 2. However, the output format says to provide the answer directly. The example given in the problem had a single answer. But according to the data, there are two respondents. However, perhaps the user made a mistake, or maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, looking back at the data for Respondent 3: their SessionName is ""III-Sepsis"" and the date is 2025-04-04. The question is about the 'III - Sepsis' session. The hyphen and space might be a typo, but in data analysis, exact string matching is usually required. However, in the given data, the sessions are named with variations. For example, Respondent 15's SessionName is ""III - Sepsis"" (with a space and hyphen), while Respondent 4's is ""III (Sepsis)"" (with parentheses), and Respondent 3's is ""III-Sepsis"" (hyphen without space). Are these considered the same session? The user's task is to consider the 'III - Sepsis' session. The exact match would be Respondent 15, but Respondent 15's Background (history) is 2. However, the other respondents have similar session names but different formatting. This is a possible point of confusion.

If we strictly match the session name as 'III - Sepsis' (exact string), then only Respondent 15 qualifies. But in that case, their Background (history) is 2, which is not the highest. However, if we consider variations (like III-Sepsis, III (Sepsis)), then Respondents 3,4,7,15 are included. But the question specifies 'III - Sepsis', which is the exact name as in Respondent 15. Wait, the task says: ""in the 'III - Sepsis' session"". The exact SessionName for Respondent 15 is ""III - Sepsis"" (with a space and hyphen). The others have variations. So, perhaps only Respondent 15 is in that exact session. But then, their Background (history) is 2, which is not the highest. But in that case, there's no one with higher than 2. But that can't be right. Alternatively, maybe the user intended all variations of the session name to be considered. This is a critical point.

Alternatively, perhaps the session names are considered the same regardless of formatting differences. For example, ""III - Sepsis"", ""III-Sepsis"", ""III (Sepsis)"" are all the same session. In that case, the respondents in the III-Sepsis session (regardless of formatting) are 3,4,7,15. Among these, the highest Background (history) is 3 (Respondents 3 and 4). Then, their global ratings are 3 and 2. But the question is asking for the global rating of the respondent with the highest Background (history). If there are two, the answer would be both 3 and 2. But the output format requires a single value. This is conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps the user made a typo and the correct session is ""III-Sepsis"" as in Respondent 3 and 7. But the question says 'III - Sepsis'. This is ambiguous. However, given that in the example provided in the initial problem, the answer was 2 for the Assessment of the respondent in the 'II (Anaphylaxsis)' session, which matched Respondent 9's SessionName ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"", it's clear that exact matching is required, including the formatting. Therefore, in the current task, the session name must exactly match 'III - Sepsis' (with space and hyphen). Therefore, only Respondent 15 is in that session. But Respondent 15's Background (history) is 2. Then, the highest in that session is 2. But the question is asking for the highest Background (history) in that session. So, the highest is 2, and the respondent is Respondent 15. Therefore, their global rating is 2. But that contradicts the data where other respondents in similar sessions have higher scores. But according to exact string matching, only Respondent 15 is in 'III - Sepsis', so their Background (history) is 2, which is the highest in that session. Therefore, the answer would be 2. But that seems counterintuitive because other sessions with similar names have higher scores. However, the problem might be testing attention to detail in exact string matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the session names are considered the same regardless of formatting. For example, ""III - Sepsis"", ""III-Sepsis"", and ""III (Sepsis)"" are all considered the same session. In that case, the highest Background (history) is 3 (Respondents 3 and 4), and their global ratings are 3 and 2. But the question is singular, so which one to choose? The answer would need to list both, but the output format says for a list, provide a comma-separated list. However, the question is phrased as ""the respondent"", which is singular. This is a problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the highest Background (history) in the 'III - Sepsis' session is 3, achieved by Respondent 3 and 4. But if the session name must exactly match 'III - Sepsis', then only Respondent 15 is in that session, and their Background (history) is 2. Therefore, the answer would be 2. But this depends on the exact session name matching. Given that in the example, the session name was 'II (Anaphylaxsis)' and the answer was Respondent 9, who had that exact SessionName, it's clear that exact matching is required. Therefore, in this case, the session name 'III - Sepsis' (with space and hyphen) is only present in Respondent 15. Therefore, the highest Background (history) in that exact session is 2, and the global rating is 2. But that seems to ignore the other respondents who might be in the same session but with different formatting. However, based on the example, exact matching is required. Therefore, the answer is 2.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Situation of the respondent whose score for 'Situation' was 3 and score for 'Background (examination)' was 3?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the Situation of the respondent who scored 3 in both 'Situation' and 'Background (examination)'. 

First, I need to look through all the respondents in the data provided. Let me go through each one by one.

Starting with Respondent 12: Their Situation is 3 and Background (examination) is 3. That matches the criteria. The Situation here is ""Identifies and prioritizes the main problem(s) unprompted"" according to the rubric. So this respondent meets both conditions. But I need to check if there are others too.

Next, Respondent 3: Situation is 2, so it doesn't qualify. Moving on.

Respondent 8: Situation is 3, but Background (examination) is 2. Doesn't meet both.

Respondent 23: Situation is 3, but Background (examination) is 2. No.

Respondent 10: Both scores are 2. Not matching.

Respondent 6: Situation is 2, so no.

Respondent 15: Situation is 3, Background (examination) is 3. Wait, here's another one. So both Respondent 12 and 15 have Situation 3 and Background (examination) 3. But wait, let me check the dates and SessionNames to make sure I'm not missing anything. The question doesn't specify a date or session, just the scores. So both of these respondents meet the criteria. But the question is asking for the Situation of the respondent(s) with those scores. Wait, the question is phrased as ""the respondent"", which might imply a single answer. Let me check again.

Wait, looking back at the data:

Respondent 12: Date 2025-05-02, Session II (Anaphylaxis), Situation 3, Background (examination) 3.

Respondent 15: Date 2025-05-04, Session III - Sepsis, Situation 3, Background (examination) 3.

So both have the required scores. But the question is asking for the Situation. Wait, the Situation is the rubric score, but the actual answer they need is the value of the 'Situation' field, which is the score's description. Wait, no. Wait, the question is phrased as ""What is the Situation of the respondent..."". The 'Situation' here refers to the actual Situation value, which is the rubric description. But in the data, the 'Situation' field is a score (3 in these cases). The rubric for Situation says that a score of 3 means ""Identifies and prioritizes the main problem(s) unprompted"". So the answer should be that description. However, the user is asking for the Situation of the respondent(s) who have both scores as 3. So the answer would be the rubric description for Situation 3, which is ""Identifies and prioritizes the main problem(s) unprompted"".

But wait, the output rules say that for MCQ fields, map the code to the corresponding option text. The Situation field's rubric is a scale from 0 to 3, each with a description. So the answer should be the text corresponding to a score of 3 in the Situation rubric. 

Looking at the Situation's rubric:

0 = Unable to identify the main problem(s)

1 = Identifies the main problem(s) after extended prompting

2 = Identifies the main problem(s) with fewer prompts needed

3 = Identifies and prioritizes the main problem(s) unprompted

So any respondent with a Situation score of 3 would have that description. The question is asking for the Situation (the text) of the respondent(s) who have both Situation 3 and Background (examination) 3. 

But the answer is the text, not the score. So even if there are multiple respondents, the answer is the same text. However, the output rules state that if the question asks for a list, provide a comma-separated list. But the question is phrased as ""the respondent"", which might imply a singular answer. Wait, but there are two respondents (12 and 15) who meet the criteria. So the answer would be the Situation description for both. But since the question is asking for the Situation of the respondent(s), and the Situation is the same for both (since they both scored 3), the answer is the same. So regardless of how many respondents meet the criteria, the answer is the text corresponding to Situation 3.

But wait, the output rules say to provide the human-readable value. So if the question is asking for the Situation (the value, which is the text), then the answer is ""Identifies and prioritizes the main problem(s) unprompted"".

But let me confirm. The task is: ""What is the Situation of the respondent whose score for 'Situation' was 3 and score for 'Background (examination)' was 3?""

So the answer is the Situation description (text) for the respondent(s) who have those scores. Since both respondents 12 and 15 have Situation 3, their Situation is the same. Therefore, the answer is the text for Situation 3, regardless of how many respondents there are. The answer is the rubric's text for a score of 3 in Situation.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Identification of the respondent whose score for 'Background (history)' was 2 and score for 'Assessment' was 3?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the Identification score of the respondent who has a Background (history) score of 2 and an Assessment score of 3. 

First, I need to go through each respondent in the data and check their Background (history) and Assessment scores. 

Starting with Respondent 1: Background (history) is 2, but Assessment is 3. Wait, that matches the criteria. But their Identification is -1. However, looking at the rubric for Identification, the possible scores are 0, 1, 2, 3. A score of -1 isn't listed. Maybe that's a typo? But according to the data provided, it's -1. But since the question asks for the Identification score, I should note this, but maybe there's another respondent.

Next, Respondent 22: Background (history) is 3, Assessment is 2. Doesn't match.

Respondent 18: Background (history) is 2, Assessment is 3. Here, Identification is 3. So this is a possible candidate. But wait, let's check others.

Respondent 10: Background (history) is 2, Assessment is 2. No.

Respondent 4: Background (history) is 3, Assessment is 2. No.

Respondent 5: Background (history) is 3, Assessment is 3. So Background is 3, which doesn't match the required 2.

Respondent 9: Background (history) is 2, Assessment is 2. No.

Respondent 19: Background (history) is 3, Assessment is 2. No.

Respondent 15: Background (history) is 2, Assessment is 2. No.

Respondent 2: Background (history) is 2, Assessment is 3. Here, Identification is 3. So this is another candidate.

Wait, Respondent 1: Background (history) 2, Assessment 3, Identification -1. But the rubric for Identification doesn't have -1. Maybe that's a data entry error. The possible scores are 0-3. So perhaps that's a mistake, but the data says -1. However, the question is asking for the Identification score, so if the data says -1, but the rubric doesn't include that, maybe it's an error. But the user wants the answer based on the data provided. So if Respondent 1 has Background (history) 2 and Assessment 3, their Identification is -1. But the problem is, the question is asking for the Identification of the respondent with those scores. So if there are multiple respondents, we need to list all. Wait, let's check all respondents again.

Wait, let's list all respondents with Background (history) 2 and Assessment 3:

- Respondent 1: Background (history) 2, Assessment 3. Identification -1.
- Respondent 18: Background (history) 2, Assessment 3. Identification 3.
- Respondent 2: Background (history) 2, Assessment 3. Identification 3.

Wait, no. Let me check again:

Looking at each respondent:

Respondent 1: Background (history) 2, Assessment 3. Identification -1.

Respondent 18: Background (history) 2, Assessment 3. Identification 3.

Respondent 2: Background (history) 2, Assessment 3. Identification 3.

Wait, Respondent 2's data: Date 2025-04-04, SessionName MI. Background (history) 2, Assessment 3. So yes, that's another one.

So there are three respondents: 1, 18, and 2. But wait, let's check again.

Wait, Respondent 1's Background (history) is 2, Assessment is 3. Identification is -1.

Respondent 18: Background (history) 2, Assessment 3. Identification 3.

Respondent 2: Background (history) 2, Assessment 3. Identification 3.

So three respondents meet the criteria. But the question is asking for the Identification of the respondent(s) with those scores. However, the answer needs to be the Identification value. 

But the problem is, the user might have intended to have only one correct answer. Let me check again.

Wait, looking back at the data:

Respondent 1: Background (history) 2, Assessment 3. Identification -1.

But the Identification rubric is 0-3. So -1 is invalid. Maybe it's a typo. But according to the data, it's -1. So if we take the data as is, then Respondent 1's Identification is -1. But the question is asking for the Identification score. So if the answer is -1, but the options are 0-3, perhaps the correct answer is 3 from other respondents.

Wait, but Respondent 18: Background (history) 2, Assessment 3. Identification 3.

Respondent 2: Background (history) 2, Assessment 3. Identification 3.

So there are two respondents (18 and 2) with Background (history) 2 and Assessment 3, both with Identification 3. But wait, let me check Respondent 2's data again.

Respondent 2's data:

- Date: 2025-04-04
- SessionName: MI
- Identification: 3
- Situation: 3
- Background (history): 2
- Background (examination): 3
- Assessment: 3
- Recommendation (clear recommendation): 2
- Recommendation (global rating scale): 1
- Comments: (empty)

Yes, so Background (history) is 2, Assessment is 3. Identification is 3.

Respondent 18:

- Date: 2025-05-04
- SessionName: IV - VT
- Identification: 3
- Situation: 3
- Background (history): 2
- Background (examination): 2
- Assessment: 3
- Recommendation (clear recommendation): 2
- Recommendation (global rating scale): 2
- Comments: Not very concise or clear communication, Satisfactory

So both Respondent 2 and 18 have Background (history) 2 and Assessment 3, with Identification 3. Respondent 1 has the same scores but Identification -1, which is invalid. So the answer should be 3, as both valid respondents have Identification 3. But the question says ""the respondent"", implying singular. But there are two. However, looking at the data, maybe there's a mistake. Let me check again.

Wait, the task is: ""What is the Identification of the respondent whose score for 'Background (history)' was 2 and score for 'Assessment' was 3?""

So if there are multiple respondents, the answer would be a list. But according to the output rules, if the question asks for a list of IDs, provide a comma-separated list. But here, the answer is the Identification score, which is 3 for both. So the answer is 3. Because even though there are two respondents, their Identification is the same. So the answer is 3.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Situation of the respondent with the highest Recommendation (clear recommendation) in the 'II - Anaphylaxsis' session?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the Situation score of the respondent who has the highest Recommendation (clear recommendation) in the 'II - Anaphylaxsis' session.

First, I need to identify all respondents who participated in the session named 'II - Anaphylaxsis'. Looking at the data, the SessionName can have slight variations, like ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"", ""II-Anaphylaxsis"", and ""II - Anaphylaxsis"". So I need to check all these variations to make sure I capture all relevant respondents.

Looking through the responses:

- Respondent 9: SessionName is ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"" on 2025-05-04.
- Respondent 23: SessionName is ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" on 2025-03-14.
- Respondent 5: SessionName is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" on 2025-05-04.

These three seem to be part of the 'II - Anaphylaxsis' session, considering possible formatting differences. Now, I need to check their Recommendation (clear recommendation) scores.

- Respondent 9: Recommendation (clear recommendation) is 3.
- Respondent 23: Recommendation (clear recommendation) is 3.
- Respondent 5: Recommendation (clear recommendation) is 2.

So, both Respondent 9 and 23 have the highest score of 3. Now, among these two, I need to determine which one has the higher Situation score. 

Looking at their Situation scores:

- Respondent 9: Situation is 3.
- Respondent 23: Situation is 3.

Both have the same Situation score. Therefore, the answer would be 3, which according to the rubric for Situation means ""Identifies and prioritizes the main problem(s) unprompted"".

What is the Recommendation (global rating scale) of the respondent with the highest Recommendation (global rating scale) in the 'II (Anaphylaxsis)' session?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the Recommendation (global rating scale) of the respondent with the highest score in that category for the 'II (Anaphylaxsis)' session.

First, I need to identify all respondents who participated in the session named 'II (Anaphylaxsis)'. Looking at the responses, I see that there are two entries with that session name: Respondent 9 and Respondent 5. 

Respondent 9's SessionName is listed as ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"" with a date of 2025-05-04. Their Recommendation (global rating scale) is 2. 

Respondent 5's SessionName is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" on the same date, 2025-05-04. Their global rating scale here is 3. 

Even though the session names are slightly different in formatting (parentheses vs. a dash), the core name is the same, so both should be considered part of the same session. 

Now, comparing their global rating scores: Respondent 9 has a 2, and Respondent 5 has a 3. The highest between them is 3. 

According to the rubric for the global rating scale, a score of 3 means ""Confident and required little or no questioning."" 

So the answer should be the text corresponding to the highest score, which is 3. The output needs to be the human-readable value from the rubric, not the number. Therefore, the correct answer is ""Confident and required little or no questioning.""

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Situation of the respondent whose score for 'Situation' was 3 and score for 'Assessment' was 3?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the Situation of the respondent who scored 3 in 'Situation' and 3 in 'Assessment'. 

First, I need to look through all the respondents in the data provided. Each respondent has various scores for different categories. The key here is to filter out the respondents who have both 'Situation' and 'Assessment' scores of 3.

Looking at Respondent 6: Their Situation is 2 and Assessment is 2. Doesn't meet the criteria.

Respondent 15: Situation 3, Assessment 2. Close, but the Assessment is 2, not 3. So no.

Respondent 18: Situation 3, Assessment 3. Oh, this one fits. Let me check the other fields. Their SessionName is IV - VT. But the question is about the 'Situation' of this respondent. Wait, the question is asking for the actual Situation value, but since the Situation score is 3, the answer would be the description of what a 3 in Situation means according to the questions schema.

Wait, no. Wait, the question is phrased as ""What is the Situation of the respondent..."". The 'Situation' here refers to the actual value of the Situation field for that respondent. But the Situation field in the data is a score (3), and the question schema defines what each score means. So the answer should be the description corresponding to a score of 3 in the Situation category.

Wait, the task says: ""What is the Situation of the respondent whose score for 'Situation' was 3 and score for 'Assessment' was 3?"" So the answer is the description of the Situation score 3. Because the Situation is a rubric-based score. The actual Situation field in the data is a numerical score, but the question is asking for the textual description of that score from the questions schema.

Looking back at the questions section, the Situation question's rubric is: 0 = Unable to identify the main problem(s), 1 = Identifies the main problem(s) after extended prompting, 2 = Identifies the main problem(s) with fewer prompts needed, 3 = Identifies and prioritizes the main problem(s) unprompted.

So the answer should be ""Identifies and prioritizes the main problem(s) unprompted"".

But wait, the task is to find the Situation (the actual value) of the respondent who has Situation=3 and Assessment=3. Wait, no. The question is phrased as ""What is the Situation of the respondent..."", but in the data, the 'Situation' is a numerical score. However, the user is asking for the Situation, which is the textual description corresponding to the score. Because the question is in the context of the data schema. So the answer is the rubric text for a score of 3 in the Situation category.

But let me confirm. The user's task is: ""What is the Situation of the respondent whose score for 'Situation' was 3 and score for 'Assessment' was 3?"" So they want the Situation description (the text from the rubric) for the respondent(s) who have both Situation=3 and Assessment=3.

First, find which respondents have both scores. Let's check each respondent:

Respondent 6: Situation 2, Assessment 2. No.

Respondent 15: Situation 3, Assessment 2. No.

Respondent 18: Situation 3, Assessment 3. Yes.

Respondent 14: Situation 3, Assessment 3. Yes.

Respondent 21: Situation 2, Assessment 2. No.

Respondent 1: Situation 2, Assessment 3. No.

Respondent 4: Situation 3, Assessment 2. No.

Respondent 3: Situation 2, Assessment 3. No.

Respondent 22: Situation 3, Assessment 2. No.

Respondent 12: Situation 3, Assessment 2. No.

So only Respondent 18 and Respondent 14 have Situation=3 and Assessment=3. Wait, let me check again:

Respondent 18: Situation 3, Assessment 3. Yes.

Respondent 14: Situation 3, Assessment 3. Yes.

Wait, looking at the data:

Respondent 18:

- **Situation:** 3

- **Assessment:** 3

Yes.

Respondent 14:

- **Situation:** 3

- **Assessment:** 3

Yes.

So there are two respondents who meet the criteria. But the question is asking for the Situation of the respondent(s) in this case. However, the Situation here refers to the rubric description. Since both have Situation=3, the answer would be the same for both: ""Identifies and prioritizes the main problem(s) unprompted"".

But the output instructions say to provide the human-readable value. So regardless of how many respondents meet the criteria, the answer is the rubric text for Situation score 3. However, the question might be asking for the actual Situation value (the score), but the way it's phrased is a bit ambiguous. Wait, no. The question is ""What is the Situation of the respondent..."", and in the data, the 'Situation' is a numerical score. But according to the output rules, for MCQ fields, we need to map the code to the corresponding option text. So the 'Situation' field is a rubric-based score, which is like an MCQ with options 0-3. Therefore, the answer should be the text corresponding to the score 3 in the Situation rubric.

But the task is to find the Situation (the value) of the respondent(s) who have Situation=3 and Assessment=3. So even if there are multiple respondents, the answer is the rubric text for Situation=3. Because the question is not asking for the number of respondents, but the Situation (description) of those respondents. Since all such respondents have Situation=3, the answer is the description for 3.

Therefore, the answer is ""Identifies and prioritizes the main problem(s) unprompted"".

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Recommendation (global rating scale) of the respondent whose total score for 'Background (examination)' and 'Assessment' was exactly 5?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the Recommendation (global rating scale) for the respondent whose total score for 'Background (examination)' and 'Assessment' adds up to exactly 5. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The 'Questions' section defines each field, including the rubric for scoring. The 'Responses' section has data from multiple respondents. 

The key here is to look at each respondent's scores for 'Background (examination)' and 'Assessment', sum them, and check if the total is 5. Once I find such a respondent, I need to report their 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' value based on the rubric.

Let me go through each respondent one by one:

- **Respondent 18**: Background (examination) = 2, Assessment = 3. Sum is 5. So this is a candidate. Their Global Rating Scale is 2. According to the rubric, 2 corresponds to ""Confident but required some further questioning"".
- **Respondent 2**: Background (examination) = 3, Assessment = 3. Sum is 6. Not 5.
- **Respondent 12**: Background (examination) = 3, Assessment = 2. Sum is 5. Another candidate. Their Global Rating Scale is 3, which is ""Confident and required little or no questioning"".
- **Respondent 19**: Background (examination) = 3, Assessment = 2. Sum is 5. Their Global Rating Scale is 3.
- **Respondent 23**: Background (examination) = 2, Assessment = 3. Sum is 5. Global Rating Scale is 3.
- **Respondent 5**: Background (examination) = 3, Assessment = 3. Sum is 6.
- **Respondent 14**: Background (examination) = 2, Assessment = 3. Sum is 5. Global Rating Scale is 2.
- **Respondent 20**: Background (examination) = -1, Assessment = 3. Sum is 2. Not relevant.
- **Respondent 1**: Background (examination) = 2, Assessment = 3. Sum is 5. Global Rating Scale is 2.

Wait, so multiple respondents have a sum of 5. The question is asking for the Recommendation (global rating scale) of the respondent(s) where the sum is exactly 5. But the answer needs to be the value of that rating. However, the problem might be that there are multiple respondents, but the answer expects a single value. Let me check again.

Wait, the question says ""the respondent"" (singular), but there might be multiple. However, looking at the data:

Looking at the respondents with sum 5:

- Respondent 18: GRS 2
- Respondent 12: GRS 3
- Respondent 19: GRS 3
- Respondent 23: GRS 3
- Respondent 14: GRS 2
- Respondent 1: GRS 2

But the answer needs to be the GRS for each of these. However, the question is phrased as ""the respondent"", which might imply there's only one. But according to the data, there are multiple. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, let's recheck each:

Respondent 18: Background (examination) is 2, Assessment is 3. 2+3=5. Correct.

Respondent 12: Background (examination) 3, Assessment 2. 3+2=5. Correct.

Respondent 19: Background (examination) 3, Assessment 2. 5. Correct.

Respondent 23: Background (examination) 2, Assessment 3. 5. Correct.

Respondent 14: Background (examination) 2, Assessment 3. 5. Correct.

Respondent 1: Background (examination) 2, Assessment 3. 5. Correct.

So there are six respondents where the sum is 5. But the answer expects a single value. Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the GRS of the respondent(s) with sum 5, and if there are multiple, list them. But according to the output rules, if it's a list, provide a comma-separated list. However, the output rules say for a count, provide the number, for a list of names or IDs, comma-separated. But here, the answer is the GRS values. But the question is asking for the GRS of the respondent(s) in question. So if there are multiple, we need to list all their GRS values. But the example given in the problem had a single answer (Answer: 2). However, in the example, the answer was 2, which was the Assessment score for the session II (Anaphylaxis) on 2025-05-04. But in that case, there was only one respondent with that session and date. 

In the current task, the question is to find the GRS for respondents where Background (examination) + Assessment =5. Let's check each of the respondents again:

Looking at the data:

Respondent 18: GRS 2

Respondent 12: GRS 3

Respondent 19: GRS 3

Respondent 23: GRS 3

Respondent 14: GRS 2

Respondent 1: GRS 2

So the possible GRS values are 2 and 3. But the answer needs to be the human-readable value based on the rubric. The rubric for GRS is:

0 = Not at all confident

1 = Confident but required extended questioning

2 = Confident but required some further questioning

3 = Confident and required little or no questioning

So for each of these respondents, their GRS is either 2 or 3. Therefore, the answer would be the list of GRS values converted to their text. But the output rules state that for a list, provide a comma-separated list. However, the task is phrased as ""the respondent"", which might be a mistake if there are multiple. Alternatively, perhaps there's a miscalculation.

Wait, let me check again the data for each respondent:

Respondent 18: Background (examination) is 2, Assessment 3. Sum 5. GRS 2.

Respondent 12: Background (examination) 3, Assessment 2. Sum 5. GRS 3.

Respondent 19: Background (examination) 3, Assessment 2. Sum 5. GRS 3.

Respondent 23: Background (examination) 2, Assessment 3. Sum 5. GRS 3.

Respondent 14: Background (examination) 2, Assessment 3. Sum 5. GRS 2.

Respondent 1: Background (examination) 2, Assessment 3. Sum 5. GRS 2.

So the GRS values are 2,3,3,3,2,2. So the possible answers are ""Confident but required some further questioning"" and ""Confident and required little or no questioning"".

But the question is asking for ""the respondent"" (singular), which suggests there's only one. But according to the data, there are multiple. This might be a trick question where perhaps the user made a mistake, but according to the data, there are multiple. However, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I misread the 'Background (examination)' and 'Assessment' scores. Let me go through each respondent again:

Respondent 18: Background (examination) = 2, Assessment =3. Sum 5. Correct.

Respondent 12: Background (examination) =3, Assessment=2. Sum 5. Correct.

Respondent 19: Background (examination)=3, Assessment=2. Sum 5. Correct.

Respondent 23: Background (examination)=2, Assessment=3. Sum 5. Correct.

Respondent 14: Background (examination)=2, Assessment=3. Sum 5. Correct.

Respondent 1: Background (examination)=2, Assessment=3. Sum 5. Correct.

Yes, all these have sum 5. So the answer would be the GRS for each of these. But the output rules say to provide the human-readable value. If the question expects multiple answers, but the output format requires a single value, there's a conflict. However, the example given in the problem had a single answer. Maybe the user expects all possible GRS values, but the output should be a list. Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the data entry. Let me check again.

Wait, looking at Respondent 1: Their Background (examination) is 2, Assessment is 3. Sum 5. GRS is 2. So ""Confident but required some further questioning"".

Similarly, Respondent 14: GRS 2.

Respondent 18: GRS 2.

Respondent 12,19,23: GRS 3.

So the possible answers are both 2 and 3. But the question is phrased as ""the respondent"", which is singular. This suggests that perhaps there's only one respondent, but according to the data, there are multiple. This could be a mistake in the question or the data. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the GRS of the respondent whose total score for 'Background (examination)' and 'Assessment' was exactly 5. So if there are multiple respondents, the answer would be all their GRS values. But the output rules state that for a list, provide a comma-separated list. However, the output example in the problem was a single number. But in this case, the answer would be multiple values. 

But according to the output rules, if the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a comma-separated list. But here, the answer is the GRS values. The rubric for GRS is a scale, so each GRS value is a separate entry. So the answer would be the text corresponding to each GRS score for the respondents in question. 

But the problem is that the user might expect a single answer. Let me check the data again. Wait, perhaps there's a respondent with a unique sum of 5. Let me check again:

No, as per the data, there are six respondents with sum 5. So the answer would be the GRS values for all of them. But how to present that. The output rules say for a list, comma-separated. So the answer would be ""Confident but required some further questioning, Confident and required little or no questioning"" but that's not correct because some have 2 and some have 3. Wait, no. Each respondent's GRS is either 2 or 3. So the list would include both values. But the output should be each GRS value for each qualifying respondent. However, the output rules don't specify how to handle multiple answers. The example in the problem had a single answer. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is designed to have only one correct answer. Let me check the data again. Maybe I made a mistake in calculation. Let me recheck each respondent:

Respondent 18: 2 +3=5. GRS 2.

Respondent 12:3+2=5. GRS 3.

Respondent 19:3+2=5. GRS 3.

Respondent 23:2+3=5. GRS 3.

Respondent 14:2+3=5. GRS 2.

Respondent 1:2+3=5. GRS 2.

So there are two respondents with GRS 2 and three with GRS 3. But the question is asking for the GRS of the respondent(s) with sum 5. So the answer would be both 2 and 3. But how to present that. The output rules say to provide the human-readable value, not the code. So for each GRS value, map to the text. But since there are multiple, perhaps the answer is a list of the distinct values. But the output example in the problem had a single answer. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is intended to have multiple correct answers, and the user expects all of them. But the output format requires a single answer. This is conflicting. 

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in reading the data. Let me check again:

Looking at Respondent 5: Background (examination) is 3, Assessment 3. Sum 6. Not 5.

Respondent 20: Background (examination) -1, Assessment 3. Sum 2.

Others:

Respondent 2: sum 3+3=6.

So the correct respondents are 18,12,19,23,14,1. All have sum 5. Their GRS are 2,3,3,3,2,2. So the possible GRS values are 2 and 3. Therefore, the answer would be both ""Confident but required some further questioning"" and ""Confident and required little or no questioning"". But how to present this. The output rules don't specify, but the example had a single answer. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is designed to have only one correct answer, and there's a mistake in the data entry. For example, maybe one of the respondents has a sum of 5 and a unique GRS. But according to the data, that's not the case. 

Alternatively, perhaps the user made a typo in the session name or date. Wait, the task is to find the GRS for the respondent whose total score for 'Background (examination)' and 'Assessment' was exactly 5. There's no restriction on date or session name. So all respondents with sum 5 are considered. 

Given that, the answer should list all the GRS values for those respondents. But the output rules state that if the question asks for a list, provide a comma-separated list. However, the question is phrased as ""the respondent"", which is singular. This is conflicting. 

But according to the data, there are multiple respondents. Therefore, the answer should include all their GRS values. However, the output example in the problem had a single answer. Maybe the user expects all possible GRS values, but the answer should list each one. 

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is ""Confident but required some further questioning, Confident and required little or no questioning"". But the output rules say to provide the human-readable value. If multiple, perhaps list them. But the output example in the problem was a single value. 

Alternatively, maybe the answer is the count of such respondents. But the question asks for the GRS, not the count. 

This is a bit confusing. But according to the data, there are multiple respondents with sum 5, and their GRS values are 2 and 3. Therefore, the answer should list both. However, the output rules don't specify how to handle multiple answers. But the example in the problem had a single answer, so perhaps the user expects a single answer. 

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation. Let me check again:

Wait, Respondent 12: Background (examination) is 3, Assessment is 2. Sum 5. GRS 3.

Respondent 19: same as 12. GRS 3.

Respondent 23: Background (examination) 2, Assessment 3. Sum 5. GRS 3.

Respondent 18: sum 5, GRS 2.

Respondent 14: sum 5, GRS 2.

Respondent 1: sum 5, GRS 2.

So the GRS values are 2 and 3. Therefore, the answer should include both. But the output rules say to provide the human-readable value, not the code. So the answer would be ""Confident but required some further questioning, Confident and required little or no questioning"". But the output example in the problem had a single answer, so maybe the user expects a list. However, the output rules for a list say to provide a comma-separated list. 

But the problem is that the question is phrased in singular, which is confusing. However, based on the data, the correct answer includes both GRS values. Therefore, the answer is both ""Confident but required some further questioning"" and ""Confident and required little or no questioning"". 

But how to present this. The output rules state to provide the human-readable value. If multiple, perhaps list them. So the answer would be a comma-separated list of the distinct values. 

Therefore, the final answer is ""Confident but required some further questioning, Confident and required little or no questioning"".

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Recommendation (global rating scale) of the respondent from the 'II-Anaphylaxsis' session whose Recommendation (global rating scale) is higher than the average Recommendation (global rating scale) for all sessions on '2025-03-14'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the Recommendation (global rating scale) of the respondent from the 'II-Anaphylaxsis' session whose GRS is higher than the average GRS for all sessions on 2025-03-14.

First, I need to identify all the respondents from the 'II-Anaphylaxsis' session. Looking at the responses, Respondent 23 has SessionName 'II-Anaphylaxsis' and Date 2025-03-14. Their GRS is 3.

Next, calculate the average GRS for all sessions on 2025-03-14. Let's list all respondents from that date. Respondents 23, 7, 14, and 10. Their GRS scores are 3, 2, 2, and 2 respectively. Adding those: 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 9. Average is 9 / 4 = 2.25.

Now, compare Respondent 23's GRS (3) to the average (2.25). Since 3 is higher than 2.25, we include them. The question asks for the GRS value, which according to the rubric is 3. The output should be the text corresponding to 3, which is ""Confident and required little or no questioning"".

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Background (examination) of the respondent whose score for 'Background (examination)' was 1 and score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' was 3?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the Background (examination) of the respondent who scored 1 in 'Background (examination)' and 3 in 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)'. 

First, I need to look through each respondent's data in the provided survey responses. Let me go through each one:

Starting with Respondent 8: Their Background (examination) is 2, and Recommendation (clear recommendation) is 2. Doesn't match.

Respondent 6: Background (examination) is 3, Recommendation is 2. Not a match.

Respondent 22: Background (examination) is 3, Recommendation is 2. No.

Respondent 14: Background (examination) is 2, Recommendation is 1. Not it.

Respondent 1: Background (examination) is 2, Recommendation is 2. Nope.

Respondent 21: Background (examination) is 1, Recommendation (clear recommendation) is 3. Oh, this looks like a match. Let me check again. Yes, Background (examination) is 1, and the Recommendation score here is 3. So this is the one.

Wait, let me check the rest to be sure. Respondent 11: Background (examination) is 3, Recommendation is 3. But the Background here is 3, so not matching. Respondent 20: Background (examination) is -1, Recommendation is 2. No. Respondent 13: Background (examination) is 1, but Recommendation is 2. So only Respondent 21 meets both criteria. 

Therefore, the answer should be the Background (examination) value for Respondent 21. But wait, the question asks for the Background (examination) of that respondent. Wait, no—the question is asking for the actual value, which is the score. Wait, no, the question says ""What is the Background (examination) of the respondent..."". Wait, looking back at the data structure, the 'Background (examination)' field in the responses is a numerical score based on the rubric. The question is asking for the value, which is the score. But according to the output rules, for MCQ fields, we need to map the code to the corresponding text. Wait, but the rubric for Background (examination) is a scale from 0 to 3. The output rules say for MCQ fields, map the code to the option text. So the rubric for Background (examination) is:

0 = Observations are omitted or irrelevant

1 = Observations reported but frequent clarification needed

2 = Observations reported with few further questions needed

3 = Comprehensive focused examination/observations

So the respondent with a score of 1 in Background (examination) would have the text ""Observations reported but frequent clarification needed"".

But the task is to output the Background (examination) value, which in the data is a numerical score. Wait, the question is phrased as ""What is the Background (examination) of the respondent..."". The user is asking for the value of that field for the specific respondent. Since the field is a rubric-based score, the answer should be the text corresponding to the score. Because the output rules state: For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses to the corresponding option text. But in this case, the responses use numbers, not letters. However, the rubric is a scale with numerical codes. So according to the output rules, we need to map the numerical code to the corresponding text from the questions schema. 

So, the respondent in question (Respondent 21) has a Background (examination) score of 1. According to the rubric, 1 corresponds to ""Observations reported but frequent clarification needed"". Therefore, the answer should be that text.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Recommendation (global rating scale) of the respondent with the highest Identification in the 'I-VF' session?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the ""Recommendation (global rating scale)"" for the respondent with the highest Identification score in the 'I-VF' session. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The data has a list of respondents, each with various scores and session names. The key fields here are SessionName, Identification, and Recommendation (global rating scale). 

The question specifies the session 'I-VF'. Looking at the responses, I need to filter out all respondents who participated in that session. Scanning through the list:

- Respondent 13 has SessionName ""I-VF"". The date is 2025-03-14. Their Identification score is 3. The Recommendation (global rating scale) is 2. 

Now, the next part is checking if there are other respondents in the 'I-VF' session. From the data provided, only Respondent 13 is listed under SessionName ""I-VF"". So they are the only one in that session. 

The question mentions the ""highest Identification"" score. Since Identification is a rubric where 3 is the highest possible (as per the questions schema: 0-3 scale), and Respondent 13 has a 3, they already have the maximum. There's no one else in that session to compare against. 

Therefore, the answer should be the global rating scale value for Respondent 13, which is 2. According to the rubric for ""Recommendation (global rating scale)"": 2 corresponds to ""Confident but required some further questioning"". 

I need to make sure there are no other respondents in the 'I-VF' session. Checking again: Respondent 13 is the only one. So the answer is 2, which maps to ""Confident but required some further questioning"".

<task>
What is the Background (history) of the respondent whose score for 'Background (history)' was 2 and score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' was 2?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the Background (history) of the respondent who scored 2 in both 'Background (history)' and 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)'. 

First, I need to look through each respondent's data. Let me start by going through the responses one by one.

Looking at Respondent 12: Their Background (history) is 3 and Recommendation (clear recommendation) is 3. Doesn't match the required scores of 2 and 2.

Respondent 10: Background (history) is 2, and Recommendation (clear recommendation) is 2. Oh, this matches both criteria. The Background (history) here is 2, so the answer might be this respondent's Background (history) value. But wait, the question asks for the actual value of Background (history), which is 2, but according to the schema, the rubric for Background (history) is a score, and the answer should be the text description. Wait, no, the question is phrased as ""What is the Background (history) of the respondent..."". Wait, the 'Background (history)' field in the responses is a numerical score. But the question is asking for the value, which in the data is 2. Wait, but the output rules say for MCQ fields to map to the option text. Wait, the 'Background (history)' is a rubric with scores 0-3. The question is asking for the value, which is the numerical score, but the output rules say for MCQ fields to map to the text. Wait, let me check the schema again.

Looking at the Questions section:

- **Background (history):** Gives appropriate history. [Rubric: 0 = History is unstructured or non-relevant, 1 = Relevant history but frequent clarification needed, 2 = Relevant history with few further questions needed, 3 = Comprehensive focused history]

So each score corresponds to a text description. The question is asking for the Background (history) of the respondent. The answer should be the text corresponding to the score of 2. But the user's task is to find which respondent has scores 2 in both fields and then report their Background (history) value. Wait, the question is phrased as ""What is the Background (history) of the respondent whose score for 'Background (history)' was 2 and score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' was 2?"" So the answer is the text description of the Background (history) score 2, which is ""Relevant history with few further questions needed"".

But wait, the output rules state: For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. However, in the responses, the Background (history) is given as a numerical score (e.g., 2). So the numerical score is the code, and the corresponding text is from the rubric. So the answer should be the text that corresponds to the score 2 for Background (history), which is ""Relevant history with few further questions needed"".

But first, I need to confirm which respondents have both Background (history) = 2 and Recommendation (clear recommendation) = 2. Let's check each respondent:

Respondent 10: Background (history) 2, Recommendation (clear recommendation) 2. So this is a match.

Respondent 7: Background (history) 2, Recommendation (clear recommendation) 2. Also a match.

Respondent 13: Background (history) 2, Recommendation (clear recommendation) 2. Another match.

Wait, let me check all respondents:

Respondent 12: Background (history) 3, Recommendation (clear recommendation) 3. No.

Respondent 10: Both 2. Yes.

Respondent 8: Background (history) 3, Recommendation 2. No.

Respondent 21: Background (history) 3, Recommendation 3. No.

Respondent 1: Background (history) 2, Recommendation 2. Wait, Respondent 1's Background (history) is 2, and Recommendation (clear recommendation) is 2. So that's another match.

Wait, let me check Respondent 1's data:

- **Respondent 1**
- **Date:** 2025-05-02
- **SessionName:** V (Hypoglycemia)
- **Identification:** -1
- **Situation:** 2
- **Background (history):** 2
- **Background (examination):** 2
- **Assessment:** 3
- **Recommendation (clear recommendation):** 2
- **Recommendation (global rating scale):** 2
- **Comments:** Satisfactory

Yes, so Respondent 1 also has Background (history) 2 and Recommendation (clear recommendation) 2.

Similarly, Respondent 7:

- **Respondent 7**
- **Date:** 2025-03-14
- **SessionName:** III-Sepsis
- **Identification:** 3
- **Situation:** 3
- **Background (history):** 2
- **Background (examination):** 3
- **Assessment:** 2
- **Recommendation (clear recommendation):** 2
- **Recommendation (global rating scale):** 2
- **Comments:** Time: (1:00-1:17)

So Respondent 7 also matches.

Respondent 13:

- **Respondent 13**
- **Date:** 2025-03-14
- **SessionName:** I-VF
- **Identification:** 3
- **Situation:** 3
- **Background (history):** 2
- **Background (examination):** 1
- **Assessment:** 2
- **Recommendation (clear recommendation):** 2
- **Recommendation (global rating scale):** 2
- **Comments:** Time: (10:29-10:54) Ventricular fibrillation (CVS) Lack of communication btween 2 main interns Further brief to patient, ask patent concerns

So Respondent 13 also has both scores as 2.

So there are multiple respondents matching the criteria: Respondent 10, 1, 7, 13. But the question is asking for the Background (history) of the respondent(s) who meet these criteria. However, the answer expects a single value, which is the text corresponding to the score 2 for Background (history). Since all these respondents have a Background (history) score of 2, the answer would be the same for all of them: ""Relevant history with few further questions needed"".

But wait, the output rules say to provide the human-readable value. So even if multiple respondents meet the criteria, the answer is the text for the score 2 in Background (history). The question is phrased as ""What is the Background (history) of the respondent..."", which is singular. But if there are multiple respondents, perhaps the answer is the same for all. Let me check the data again.

Wait, the question is asking for the Background (history) of the respondent(s) with those two scores. Since the Background (history) score is 2, the corresponding text is the same for all. So regardless of how many respondents, the answer is ""Relevant history with few further questions needed"".

But let me confirm the output rules. The output must be the human-readable value, not the code. So for the Background (history) score of 2, the text is ""Relevant history with few further questions needed"". Therefore, the answer is that text.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Recommendation (clear recommendation) of the respondent whose total score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and 'Situation' was exactly 4?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the Recommendation (clear recommendation) of the respondent whose total score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and 'Situation' adds up to exactly 4. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and 'Situation' are both rubric-based scores. Each respondent has a value for these two fields. The question wants the sum of these two scores to be exactly 4. 

So, I need to go through each respondent's data, check their 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and 'Situation' scores, add them, and see if they equal 4. Then, for the respondent(s) that meet this condition, I need to report their 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' value according to the rubric.

Looking at the data:

Starting with Respondent 12:
- Situation: 3
- Recommendation (clear recommendation): 3
Sum: 3 + 3 = 6. Not 4.

Respondent 21:
- Situation: 2
- Recommendation: 3
Sum: 5. Not 4.

Respondent 17:
- Situation: 3
- Recommendation: 3
Sum: 6. No.

Respondent 13:
- Situation: 3
- Recommendation: 2
Sum: 5. No.

Respondent 18:
- Situation: 3
- Recommendation: 2
Sum: 5. Still no.

Respondent 11:
- Situation: 3
- Recommendation: 3
Sum: 6. Nope.

Respondent 1:
- Situation: 2
- Recommendation: 2
Sum: 4. Oh, here's one. Wait, but let's check others.

Respondent 4:
- Situation: 3
- Recommendation: 2
Sum: 5. No.

Respondent 15:
- Situation: 3
- Recommendation: 2
Sum: 5. No.

Respondent 5:
- Situation: 3
- Recommendation: 2
Sum: 5. No.

Wait, so only Respondent 1 has a sum of 2 (Situation) + 2 (Recommendation) = 4. Let me check Respondent 1's data again. 

Looking at Respondent 1:
- Date: 2025-05-02
- SessionName: V (Hypoglycemia)
- Identification: -1 (which is odd, but not relevant here)
- Situation: 2
- Recommendation (clear recommendation): 2
So 2 + 2 = 4. That's the only one. 

Now, the question asks for the 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' of that respondent. The rubric for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' is:
0 = No recommendation
1 = Clear recommendation only after extended questioning
2 = Clear recommendation after minimal questioning
3 = Clear comprehensive recommendation without questioning

Respondent 1's score here is 2, which maps to ""Clear recommendation after minimal questioning"". 

But wait, let me check if there are any other respondents I might have missed. Let me go through all again quickly:

Respondent 12: 3+3=6
21:2+3=5
17:3+3=6
13:3+2=5
18:3+2=5
11:3+3=6
1:2+2=4
4:3+2=5
15:3+2=5
5:3+2=5

Yes, only Respondent 1. So the answer is the value corresponding to 2 in the 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' rubric, which is ""Clear recommendation after minimal questioning"".

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Background (examination) of the respondent whose score for 'Identification' was 3 and score for 'Background (history)' was 3?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the Background (examination) score for the respondent who has a score of 3 in both Identification and Background (history). 

First, I need to go through each respondent in the data and check their scores for these two fields. Let's start with Respondent 4. Their Identification is 3, which matches, but their Background (history) is 3 as well. Wait, so both scores are 3. That means this respondent meets the criteria. Now, looking at their Background (examination) score, it's 2. But I should check all respondents to make sure there aren't others who also meet the criteria.

Next, Respondent 13: Identification is 3, but Background (history) is 2. Doesn't match. Respondent 19: Identification 3, Background (history) 3. Their Background (examination) is 3. Wait, so here's another one. But wait, the question is asking for the Background (examination) of the respondent(s) who have both scores as 3. So both Respondent 4 and 19 have Identification 3 and Background (history) 3. But their examination scores are 2 and 3 respectively. 

Wait, but let me check again. The task is to find the Background (examination) of the respondent(s) with both Identification 3 and Background (history) 3. So I need to list all such respondents and their examination scores. Let's go through each one:

Respondent 4: Identification 3, History 3 → Exam 2
Respondent 19: Identification 3, History 3 → Exam 3
Respondent 7: History is 2, so no
Respondent 9: History 2, no
Respondent 2: History 2, no
Respondent 14: History 2, no
Respondent 1: Identification is -1, so no
Respondent 21: History 3, Identification 3 → Exam 1
Wait, Respondent 21: Identification 3, History 3, Exam 1. So that's another one. Wait, but looking back at the data:

Wait, let me check each respondent again carefully:

Respondent 4: Identification 3, History 3 → Exam 2
Respondent 19: Identification 3, History 3 → Exam 3
Respondent 21: Identification 3, History 3 → Exam 1? Wait, no. Wait, looking at Respondent 21's data:

- **Background (history):** 3
- **Background (examination):** 1

Yes, so Respondent 21 has Identification 3, History 3, Exam 1.

Then Respondent 22: History 3, Identification 3. Let's check:

Respondent 22: Identification 3, History 3, Exam 3.

Wait, looking at the data:

Respondent 22:
- **Background (history):** 3
- **Background (examination):** 3

So that's another one. So now, the respondents with Identification 3 and History 3 are:

- Respondent 4: Exam 2
- Respondent 19: Exam 3
- Respondent 21: Exam 1
- Respondent 22: Exam 3
- Respondent 11: Let's check. Respondent 11 has Identification 3, History 3, Exam 3.

Wait, Respondent 11's data:

- **Identification:** 3
- **Background (history):** 3
- **Background (examination):** 3

Yes. So that's another one. So the respondents meeting the criteria are 4, 19, 21, 22, 11. Wait, but let me check each one again to be sure.

Looking through all respondents:

Respondent 4: Identification 3, History 3 → Exam 2
Respondent 19: Identification 3, History 3 → Exam 3
Respondent 21: Identification 3, History 3 → Exam 1
Respondent 22: Identification 3, History 3 → Exam 3
Respondent 11: Identification 3, History 3 → Exam 3

Wait, but the question is asking for the Background (examination) of the respondent(s) with those two scores. So there are multiple respondents here. But the answer might require all of them. However, the output rules say if the question asks for a list, provide a comma-separated list. But the task is phrased as ""What is the Background (examination) of the respondent..."", which might imply a single answer. Wait, but perhaps there are multiple respondents. Let me check again.

Wait, the task says ""the respondent"" (singular), but maybe there are multiple. Let me check the data again.

Looking at all respondents:

- Respondent 4: Identification 3, History 3 → Exam 2
- Respondent 19: Identification 3, History 3 → Exam 3
- Respondent 21: Identification 3, History 3 → Exam 1
- Respondent 22: Identification 3, History 3 → Exam 3
- Respondent 11: Identification 3, History 3 → Exam 3

So there are five respondents who have Identification 3 and Background (history) 3. Each of them has different examination scores. The question is asking for the Background (examination) of those respondents. So the answer would be the scores for each of them. But the output rules say if the question asks for a list, provide a comma-separated list. However, the task is phrased as ""What is the Background (examination) of the respondent..."", which might be ambiguous. But given that there are multiple respondents, the answer should list all their examination scores. 

But looking at the example provided in the problem, the answer was a single number (2), which suggests that perhaps there's only one respondent in that case. But in this case, there are multiple. However, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check each respondent again.

Wait, let's go through each respondent one by one:

1. Respondent 4: Session III (Sepsis), Date 2025-05-16. Identification 3, History 3. Exam 2.
2. Respondent 19: Session I - MI, Date 2025-05-16. Identification 3, History 3. Exam 3.
3. Respondent 21: Session I (Myocardial infarction), Date 2025-05-16. Identification 3, History 3. Exam 1.
4. Respondent 22: Session IV (VT), Date 2025-05-16. Identification 3, History 3. Exam 3.
5. Respondent 11: Session IV (AF), Date 2025-04-04. Identification 3, History 3. Exam 3.

So all these five respondents meet the criteria. Therefore, the Background (examination) scores are 2, 3, 1, 3, 3. But the question is asking for the Background (examination) of the respondent(s) with those two scores. The answer should list all these scores. However, the output rules state that if the question asks for a list, provide a comma-separated list. So the answer would be ""2, 3, 1, 3, 3"". But perhaps I made a mistake here. Wait, maybe some of these respondents don't have both Identification 3 and History 3. Let me check again.

Wait, Respondent 21's Background (history) is 3, Identification is 3. Correct. Exam is 1. So yes. Respondent 22: History 3, Identification 3. Correct. Exam 3. Respondent 11: same. So yes, five respondents. But the example in the problem had a single answer. Maybe the user expects all matching respondents. But the question is phrased as ""the respondent"", which is singular. Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in my analysis. Let me check again.

Wait, looking back at the data:

Wait, Respondent 4: Identification 3, History 3 → Exam 2
Respondent 19: Identification 3, History 3 → Exam 3
Respondent 21: Identification 3, History 3 → Exam 1
Respondent 22: Identification 3, History 3 → Exam 3
Respondent 11: Identification 3, History 3 → Exam 3

So five respondents. But the question is asking for ""the respondent"" (singular). Is there a possibility that the question is looking for a specific one, perhaps the only one? Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again. Are there any other respondents with Identification 3 and History 3?

Looking at the data again:

- Respondent 4: Yes
- Respondent 19: Yes
- Respondent 21: Yes
- Respondent 22: Yes
- Respondent 11: Yes

No others. So the answer should be all their examination scores. But the output format says if the question asks for a list, provide a comma-separated list. The task is phrased as ""What is the Background (examination) of the respondent..."", but since there are multiple, the answer should list all. However, perhaps the user expects a different approach. Maybe I missed something. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps the question is looking for the Background (examination) score of the respondent(s) who have both Identification 3 and Background (history) 3. So the answer would be the scores for each such respondent. But the output needs to be in human-readable value. If there are multiple, perhaps list them all. But the example given in the problem had a single answer. Maybe in this case, there's only one respondent. Wait, no, according to the data, there are five. But perhaps I made a mistake in reading the data. Let me check each respondent again.

Wait, Respondent 4: Identification 3, History 3 → Exam 2. Correct.

Respondent 19: Identification 3, History 3 → Exam 3. Correct.

Respondent 21: Identification 3, History 3 → Exam 1. Correct.

Respondent 22: Identification 3, History 3 → Exam 3. Correct.

Respondent 11: Identification 3, History 3 → Exam 3. Correct.

So five respondents. Therefore, the answer should be the list of their examination scores. But the output rules state that if the question asks for a list, provide a comma-separated list. So the answer would be ""2, 3, 1, 3, 3"". However, the example in the problem had a single answer, but that's because there was only one respondent matching the criteria. Here, there are multiple. Therefore, the correct answer is all the examination scores of those respondents. But perhaps the user expects all of them. So the final answer is 2, 3, 1, 3, 3. But let me check again to make sure I didn't miss any or include any incorrectly.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Situation of the respondent whose score for 'Situation' was 3 and score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' was 3?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the Situation of the respondent who scored 3 in 'Situation' and 3 in 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)'. 

First, I need to look through each respondent's data. Let's start by checking each response one by one.

Looking at Respondent 12: Their Situation is 3, and Recommendation (clear recommendation) is 3. So that's a match. The Situation here is ""Identifies and prioritizes the main problem(s) unprompted"" according to the rubric. But wait, the question is asking for the actual Situation value, which in the data is the score. Wait, no, the question is phrased as ""What is the Situation of the respondent..."". Wait, the 'Situation' field in the data is a rubric score. But the question is asking for the Situation, which is the answer the respondent provided. Wait, no, looking back at the data structure, the 'Situation' in the responses is a numerical score based on the rubric. Wait, the questions section defines 'Situation' as a rubric with scores 0-3. So the actual data for each respondent's 'Situation' is a numerical score. But the question is asking for the 'Situation' of the respondent, which in the data is the score. Wait, but the user might be confused here. Wait, no, the question is phrased as ""What is the Situation of the respondent..."", but in the data, 'Situation' is a rubric score. Wait, maybe the user is asking for the textual description of the rubric that corresponds to the score. Let me check the original question again.

The task says: ""What is the Situation of the respondent whose score for 'Situation' was 3 and score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' was 3?"" So the answer should be the rubric's text description for a score of 3 in the Situation category. According to the questions section, the Situation rubric is: 0 = Unable to identify the main problem(s), 1 = Identifies the main problem(s) after extended prompting, 2 = Identifies the main problem(s) with fewer prompts needed, 3 = Identifies and prioritizes the main problem(s) unprompted. So the answer would be ""Identifies and prioritizes the main problem(s) unprompted"".

But wait, the user might be asking which respondent(s) meet those criteria. Wait, the question is phrased as ""What is the Situation of the respondent..."", but the Situation here is the rubric score's description. But the answer would be the description of the Situation score 3. However, the user might be confused. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the actual Situation that the respondent identified, but the data doesn't have open-ended responses for Situation; it's just the numerical score. The actual Situation (the problem the patient had) would be part of the SessionName. Wait, the SessionName for Respondent 12 is II (Anaphylaxis). But the question is about the Situation score's description. So the answer is the rubric text for Situation score 3. But let me check the data again.

Wait, the user's example in the <example> shows a similar question where the answer is a numerical value (Answer: 2). But in that example, the question was about the Assessment score for a specific session and date. The answer was the numerical value. So perhaps in this case, the answer is the numerical score, but the question is phrased as ""What is the Situation..."", which is a bit confusing. Wait, no. Let me re-examine the task.

The task is: ""What is the Situation of the respondent whose score for 'Situation' was 3 and score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' was 3?"" So the user is looking for the Situation (which is a rubric score) of the respondent who has both Situation=3 and Recommendation (clear recommendation)=3. Wait, but that's redundant because the Situation is already given as 3. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the question is to find the respondent(s) who have both scores as 3 and then report their Situation score's description. But the answer would be the description of the Situation score 3. But according to the output rules, for MCQ fields, we need to map the code to the option text. However, in the data, the Situation is a numerical score (0-3), and the rubric defines what each number means. So the answer should be the text corresponding to the score 3 in the Situation rubric.

But the task is to find the respondent(s) who have Situation=3 and Recommendation (clear recommendation)=3, and then report their Situation. But since the Situation is 3, the answer is the text for that score. Let's check the respondents.

Looking at the responses:

Respondent 12: Situation=3, Recommendation (clear recommendation)=3. So this is a match.

Respondent 14: Situation=3, but Recommendation (clear recommendation)=1. Not a match.

Respondent 3: Situation=2. Not a match.

Respondent 11: Situation=3, Recommendation (clear recommendation)=3. So this is another match.

Wait, let me check all respondents:

Respondent 12: Situation=3, Rec=3. Match.

Respondent 11: SessionName IV (AF), Situation=3, Rec=3. Match.

Respondent 17: Situation=3, Rec=3? Let's check. Respondent 17's Rec (clear recommendation) is 3. Yes. So Situation=3, Rec=3. So that's a third match.

Wait, let's go through each respondent:

Respondent 12: Situation 3, Rec 3. Match.

Respondent 14: Situation 3, Rec 1. No.

Respondent 3: Situation 2. No.

Respondent 11: Situation 3, Rec 3. Match.

Respondent 20: Situation 3, Rec 2. No.

Respondent 4: Situation 3, Rec 2. No.

Respondent 10: Situation 2. No.

Respondent 17: Situation 3, Rec 3. Yes.

Respondent 19: Situation 3, Rec 3. Wait, Respondent 19's Rec (clear recommendation) is 3. Yes. So Situation=3, Rec=3. So that's a fourth match.

Wait, let's check each:

Respondent 12: Yes.

Respondent 11: Yes.

Respondent 17: Yes.

Respondent 19: Yes.

Wait, looking at the data:

Respondent 19's 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' is 3. So yes, they have Situation=3 and Rec=3.

So there are four respondents who meet the criteria. But the question is asking for the Situation of the respondent(s) who meet these criteria. But the Situation is 3 for all of them, so the answer would be the rubric text for Situation score 3. However, the output rules say to provide the human-readable value. Since the question is asking for the Situation (which is a rubric score), but the answer should be the text corresponding to the score. So the answer is ""Identifies and prioritizes the main problem(s) unprompted"".

But wait, the example given in the user's message had a similar structure. In the example, the question was about the Assessment score for a specific session and date, and the answer was the numerical value (2). But in that case, the answer was the score, not the text. So perhaps here, the answer is the numerical value. Wait, but the example's answer was 2, which is the score. But the example's question was ""What is the Assessment..."", and the answer was the score. So in this case, the question is ""What is the Situation..."", and the answer would be the score. But the user's task here is different. Wait, the example's data had the Assessment score as 2, and the answer was 2. So perhaps in this case, the answer is the score. But the current task is to find the Situation of the respondents who have Situation=3 and Rec=3. But since the Situation is already 3, the answer would be 3. But that seems redundant. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in phrasing the question. Alternatively, maybe the question is to find the actual problem identified (the SessionName) for the respondent(s) who scored 3 in both. Let me check the data again.

Wait, the SessionName for Respondent 12 is II (Anaphylaxis), Respondent 11 is IV (AF), Respondent 17 is V (Hypoglycemia), and Respondent 19 is I - MI. So if the question is asking for the SessionName (the actual situation/problem), then the answer would be the list of SessionNames for those respondents. But the question is phrased as ""What is the Situation of the respondent..."", and the Situation in the data is a rubric score. So perhaps the answer is the rubric text for Situation=3. But the example's answer was a numerical value. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the user is asking for the actual problem (the SessionName) that the respondent was dealing with, but the question is phrased as ""Situation"", which in the data is a score. This is confusing. Let me re-examine the task again.

The task is: ""What is the Situation of the respondent whose score for 'Situation' was 3 and score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' was 3?""

In the data, 'Situation' is a rubric score (0-3). The question is asking for the 'Situation' of the respondent(s) who have both scores as 3. But since 'Situation' is the score, the answer would be 3, but that's redundant. Alternatively, perhaps the user is asking for the SessionName (the medical situation, like Anaphylaxis, Hypoglycemia, etc.) of the respondents who scored 3 in both 'Situation' and 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)'. 

Looking at the respondents who meet the criteria:

Respondent 12: SessionName II (Anaphylaxis)

Respondent 11: SessionName IV (AF)

Respondent 17: SessionName V (Hypoglycemia)

Respondent 19: SessionName I - MI

So the answer would be the SessionNames of these respondents. But the question is phrased as ""What is the Situation..."", which might refer to the SessionName. However, in the data, the 'SessionName' is a separate field. The 'Situation' is a rubric score. So perhaps the user is confused between 'Situation' (the score) and the actual medical situation (SessionName). But according to the data structure, 'SessionName' is the name of the session, which likely represents the medical case (e.g., Anaphylaxis, Hypoglycemia, etc.), while 'Situation' is the rubric score for how well the respondent identified the problem.

Given the example provided by the user, where the answer was the numerical score (2), I think in this case, the answer is the rubric text corresponding to the Situation score of 3. But the example's answer was a numerical value. Wait, in the example, the question was about the Assessment score, and the answer was 2. So perhaps in this case, the answer is the numerical value 3, but that seems odd. Alternatively, maybe the user wants the count of such respondents. Wait, the task says ""What is the Situation..."", which is singular, but there are multiple respondents. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the task, and the answer is the count of respondents. But the example's answer was a single number. Let me check the example again. In the example, the question was about the Assessment score for a specific session and date, and the answer was 2. So the answer was the numerical value. So perhaps here, the answer is the numerical value 3, but that's the same as the criteria. That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the answer is the SessionName(s) of the respondents who meet the criteria. But the question is phrased as ""Situation"", which is a different field. 

This is confusing. Let me re-express the task. The user is asking for the 'Situation' of the respondents who scored 3 in both 'Situation' and 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)'. Since 'Situation' is a rubric score, the answer would be 3. But that's redundant. Alternatively, the answer is the text description of the Situation score 3. According to the output rules, for MCQ fields, we need to map the code to the option text. So if 'Situation' is considered an MCQ with options 0-3, then the answer should be the text for 3. 

The rubric for Situation is:

0 = Unable to identify the main problem(s)

1 = Identifies the main problem(s) after extended prompting

2 = Identifies the main problem(s) with fewer prompts needed

3 = Identifies and prioritizes the main problem(s) unprompted

So the answer is ""Identifies and prioritizes the main problem(s) unprompted"".

But the example's answer was a numerical value, but in that case, the question was about the Assessment score, which is also a rubric. So perhaps the answer here is the text description. However, the output rules state that for MCQ fields, the answer should be the text, not the code. So the answer should be the text corresponding to the code 3 in the Situation rubric. 

But the respondents who have Situation=3 and Rec=3 are multiple. The question is asking for the Situation of those respondents, which is the same for all (3), so the answer is the text for 3. 

Alternatively, if the question is asking for the SessionName (the actual medical situation), then the answer would be the list of SessionNames. But the question uses the term 'Situation', which is a specific field in the data. So I think the correct answer is the text description of the Situation score 3.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Recommendation (global rating scale) of the respondent from the 'II - Anaphylaxsis' session whose Background (history) is higher than the average Background (history) for all sessions on '2025-05-04'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the Recommendation (global rating scale) for a specific respondent. The criteria are: the session name is 'II - Anaphylaxsis', the date is '2025-05-04', and their Background (history) score is higher than the average Background (history) of all sessions on that date.

First, I need to identify all respondents from 2025-05-04. Let's look through the responses. 

Looking at the data:

- Respondent 18: Date 2025-05-04, SessionName IV - VT
- Respondent 5: Date 2025-05-04, SessionName II - Anaphylaxsis
- Any others? Let me check again. The other respondents have dates on 2025-03-14, 2025-04-04, 2025-05-02, and 2025-05-16. So only Respondent 18 and 5 are on 2025-05-04.

Now, from these two, the session name we need is 'II - Anaphylaxsis', which is Respondent 5. But let's confirm. Respondent 5's SessionName is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"", correct. So that's the target respondent.

But wait, the question also says the Background (history) should be higher than the average of all sessions on 2025-05-04. So first, calculate the average Background (history) for that date.

On 2025-05-04, there are two respondents: 18 and 5.

Respondent 18's Background (history) is 2.
Respondent 5's Background (history) is 3.

So the average is (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5.

Now, the target respondent (Respondent 5) has a Background (history) of 3, which is higher than 2.5. So they meet the criteria.

Now, look at the Recommendation (global rating scale) for Respondent 5. The value is 3. According to the rubric, 3 corresponds to ""Confident and required little or no questioning"".

Therefore, the answer should be ""Confident and required little or no questioning"".

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Recommendation (clear recommendation) of the respondent from the 'IV (VT)' session whose Situation is higher than the average Situation for all sessions on '2025-05-02'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find the Recommendation (clear recommendation) for a respondent from the 'IV (VT)' session on 2025-05-02 whose Situation score is higher than the average Situation score for all sessions on that date.

First, I need to identify all respondents from 2025-05-02. Let's look through the responses. 

Looking at the data:

- Respondent 1: Date 2025-05-02, SessionName V (Hypoglycemia), Situation 2
- Respondent 20: Date 2025-05-02, SessionName IV (VT), Situation 3
- Respondent 16: Date 2025-05-02, SessionName I - MI, Situation 3

So, three respondents on that date. Now, calculate the average Situation score. The scores are 2, 3, and 3. Adding them: 2 + 3 + 3 = 8. Divided by 3, the average is approximately 2.67.

Next, find the respondent in the 'IV (VT)' session on that date. That's Respondent 20. Their Situation score is 3, which is higher than the average of 2.67. 

Now, check their Recommendation (clear recommendation). Respondent 20 has a value of 2. According to the schema, the rubric for Recommendation (clear recommendation) is:
0 = No recommendation
1 = Clear recommendation only after extended questioning
2 = Clear recommendation after minimal questioning
3 = Clear comprehensive recommendation without questioning

So, the answer should be ""Clear recommendation after minimal questioning"".
</think>

Clear recommendation after minimal questioning",True
