<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who participated in a 'II-Anaphylaxsis' session.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The goal is to count the respondents who participated in a session named 'II-Anaphylaxsis'. 

First, I need to look at the data provided. The dataset is in XML format, with a list of respondents under the <responses> section. Each respondent has an <answer> element for the ""SessionName"" question.

I remember from the instructions that the session names might have variations in spelling or formatting. For example, in the example given, the user had to check for '2025-05-02' and 'Background (examination)' scores. So, I need to be careful about exact matches but also check for possible typos or different formatting in the session names.

Looking at the data, I'll go through each respondent's ""SessionName"" answer. Let's list them out:

- Respondent 1: V (Hypoglycemia)
- Respondent 3: III-Sepsis
- Respondent 13: I-VF
- Respondent 17: V (Hypoglycemia)
- Respondent 15: III - Sepsis
- Respondent 8: III (Sepsis)
- Respondent 7: III-Sepsis
- Respondent 12: II (Anaphylaxis)
- Respondent 23: II-Anaphylaxsis
- Respondent 19: I - MI
- Respondent 5: II - Anaphylaxsis
- Respondent 18: IV - VT

Now, the task is to find sessions named 'II-Anaphylaxsis'. Let's check each relevant entry:

- Respondent 12's SessionName is ""II (Anaphylaxis)"". The spelling here is ""Anaphylaxis"" with an 'i', not 'Anaphylaxsis' with an 's'. So this one doesn't match.
- Respondent 23's SessionName is ""II-Anaphylaxsis"". This matches exactly the target name.
- Respondent 5's SessionName is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"". The hyphen has spaces around it, but the session name part is ""Anaphylaxsis"", which matches. However, the task specifies the session name as 'II-Anaphylaxsis' with a hyphen and no spaces. But in XML data, sometimes formatting like spaces might not matter. Wait, the exact string in the data for respondent 5 is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" (with spaces around the hyphen), while the task is looking for 'II-Anaphylaxsis' (hyphen without spaces). Are these considered the same? The question is whether the session name is exactly matching. Since the task specifies 'II-Anaphylaxsis', I need to check if the respondent's SessionName is exactly that. 

Looking at the data entries:

- Respondent 23: ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" (hyphen, no spaces)
- Respondent 5: ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" (hyphen with spaces)
- Respondent 12: ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" (different spelling)

So, only respondent 23 has the exact session name ""II-Anaphylaxsis"". Respondent 5's session name has spaces around the hyphen, which might be a typo or variation, but according to the task, we need to count exact matches. Therefore, only respondent 23 matches. 

Wait, but maybe the task is case-insensitive? The session names in the data have variations in capitalization, but the task uses 'II-Anaphylaxsis' with a lowercase 's' perhaps? Wait, no, the task says 'II-Anaphylaxsis' which is how it's spelled in respondent 23. So, the exact match is only respondent 23. However, looking at respondent 5's session name: ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" (with spaces and hyphen). The session name in the task is 'II-Anaphylaxsis' (no spaces). So, unless the spaces around the hyphen are considered part of the name, they are different. Therefore, only respondent 23 matches exactly. 

But wait, in the example provided in the initial data, the user had to count respondents from '2025-05-02', and in the data, the dates are exact matches. So, exact string matching is required. Therefore, in this case, only respondent 23's SessionName exactly matches 'II-Anaphylaxsis'. Respondent 5's session name is 'II - Anaphylaxsis' (with spaces), which is a different string. Therefore, the count is 1.

But wait, let me check again. The task says ""participated in a 'II-Anaphylaxsis' session."" So, perhaps any session that is essentially II-Anaphylaxsis, regardless of spacing in the hyphen? For example, if the session name is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" (with spaces), does that count? The example in the data shows that in the initial example, the answer was 0, which might be because the session date was '2025-05-02' and the respondents on that date had different session names. So, in that case, exact matching was required. Therefore, here, the exact session name must be 'II-Anaphylaxsis' as written. Therefore, only respondent 23 matches. So the count is 1.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who participated in a 'II - Anaphylaxsis' session.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task. The question is asking to count the respondents who participated in a session named 'II - Anaphylaxsis'. 

First, I need to look at the data provided. The data is in XML format with a list of respondents, each having answers to various questions, including the session name. 

I remember that the task is to count how many respondents have the SessionName exactly as 'II - Anaphylaxsis'. Wait, but I should check the exact spelling and formatting in the data. Let me go through each respondent's SessionName.

Looking at the respondents:

- Respondent 23: SessionName is ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" (with a hyphen, no space)
- Respondent 5: SessionName is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" (with spaces around the hyphen)
- Respondent 12: SessionName is ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" (different spelling and format)
- Others have different session names like ""I - MI"", ""III (Sepsis)"", etc.

Wait, the task specifies 'II - Anaphylaxsis' with a space around the hyphen. Let me check the exact entries. 

Looking again:

Respondent 5's SessionName is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" (hyphen with spaces). Respondent 23's is ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" (hyphen without spaces). The task's target is 'II - Anaphylaxsis', so only respondent 5 matches exactly. 

But wait, sometimes there might be typos or variations. For example, the spelling ""Anaphylaxsis"" vs. ""Anaphylaxis"". Let me check the SessionName entries. 

In the data, respondent 23 and 5 have ""Anaphylaxsis"" (with two 's's?), while respondent 12 has ""Anaphylaxis"" (one 's'). The task uses 'Anaphylaxsis' (with two 's's?), so respondents 23 and 5 might be candidates. But their SessionNames are formatted differently. 

Wait, the task says 'II - Anaphylaxsis' with spaces. So respondent 5's SessionName is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" (with spaces), which matches exactly. Respondent 23's is ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" (no space), which is a different format. So only respondent 5 matches. 

But wait, maybe the hyphen vs. dash or spacing isn't considered. The task might be case-insensitive or forgiving of spacing. However, according to the output rules, we need to preserve capitalization and exactness. So the exact match is required. 

Therefore, only respondent 5 has the exact SessionName ""II - Anaphylaxsis"". So the count is 1.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who scored 3 on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task. The user wants to count the respondents who scored 3 on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)'. 

First, I need to look at the questions section to confirm the exact wording of the question ID. The question with id ""Recommendation (clear recommendation)"" has a rubric where 3 means ""Clear comprehensive recommendation without questioning"". 

Now, I'll go through each respondent in the responses section and check their answer for this question. Let's list them out:

- Respondent 8: Their answer is 2. So, not a 3.
- Respondent 2: Answer is 2. Not 3.
- Respondent 17: Answer is 3. That's one.
- Respondent 23: Answer is 3. Second one.
- Respondent 20: Answer is 2. Not counted.
- Respondent 22: Answer is 2. No.
- Respondent 4: Answer is 2. No.
- Respondent 14: Answer is 1. No.

So, only respondents 17 and 23 have a score of 3. That makes a total of 2 respondents.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents from the 'II (Anaphylactic Shock)' session who scored 1 on 'Background (history)' and 2 on 'Situation'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents from the session named 'II (Anaphylactic Shock)' who scored 1 on 'Background (history)' and 2 on 'Situation'. 

First, I need to locate all respondents in the 'responses' section. Each respondent is enclosed in a <respondent> tag with an 'id' attribute. For each of these, I need to check three things: the session name, the score for 'Background (history)', and the score for 'Situation'.

Starting with the session name. The question asks for the session named 'II (Anaphylactic Shock)'. Looking through the responses, I'll check each <answer question=""SessionName"">. 

Looking at respondent id=""6"": their SessionName is ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"". That's a match. Now, check their scores.

For 'Background (history)', respondent 6 has an answer of 3. The task requires a score of 1 here, so this doesn't match. 

Next, check other respondents. Let's go through each one:

- Respondent 23: SessionName is ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" – not a match.
- Respondent 16: ""I - MI"" – nope.
- Respondent 4: ""III (Sepsis)"" – no.
- Respondent 5: ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" – different spelling.
- Respondent 1: ""V (Hypoglycemia)"" – no.
- Respondent 18: ""IV - VT"" – no.
- Respondent 6: already checked.
- Respondent 14: ""IV-Hypoglycemia"" – no.
- Respondent 11: ""IV (AF)"" – no.
- Respondent 8: ""III (Sepsis)"" – no.

Only respondent 6 has the correct session name. But their 'Background (history)' is 3, not 1. So even though the session matches, the scores don't. 

Wait, maybe I missed another respondent. Let me check again. All other respondents have different session names. So no one else has the exact session name 'II (Anaphylactic Shock)'. 

Therefore, even though respondent 6 is in the correct session, their scores don't meet the criteria. So the count would be zero. 

But wait, let me double-check the scores for 'Situation' and 'Background (history)' for other respondents in case there's a mistake. For example, maybe someone else has the correct scores but a different session. But the task specifically requires the session to be 'II (Anaphylactic Shock)', so even if others have the scores, they wouldn't count unless they're in that session. 

So the final answer is 0.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who scored 0 on 'Background (history)' and whose 'Comments' contain the word 'Clear'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents who scored 0 on 'Background (history)' and whose 'Comments' contain the word 'Clear'. 

First, I need to understand the structure of the data provided. The XML data has a 'questions' section that defines each question, including 'Background (history)' which uses a rubric. The 'responses' section contains individual respondents with their answers.

Looking at the 'Background (history)' question, the rubric states that a score of 0 means ""History is unstructured or non-relevant"". So I need to find all respondents where the answer to this question is 0.

Next, the 'Comments' field is an open-ended question, and I need to check if the comment contains the word 'Clear' (case-sensitive as per the output rules). 

Now, I'll go through each respondent in the data:

1. **Respondent 21**: Background (history) score is 3. Comments mention ""Diagnostic clarity"" and ""Good...assessment"". 'Clarity' is not 'Clear', so skip.
2. **Respondent 7**: Background (history) is 2. Comments have ""Time..."", so no.
3. **Respondent 10**: Background (history) is 2. Comments mention ""Time..."", no 'Clear'.
4. **Respondent 11**: Background (history) is 3. Comments say ""Clear communication"", but score isn't 0. Skip.
5. **Respondent 23**: Background (history) is 2. Comments mention ""Talking to registrav...DID: Sepsis..."", no 'Clear'.
6. **Respondent 2**: Background (history) is 2. No comments. Skip.
7. **Respondent 3**: Background (history) is 3. Comments mention ""Clear communication..."", but score is 3. Not applicable.
8. **Respondent 8**: Background (history) is 3. Comments have ""Clear communication..."", but score is 3. No.
9. **Respondent 9**: Background (history) is 2. Comments mention ""unclear communication"", which is not 'Clear'.
10. **Respondent 12**: Background (history) is 3. Comments say ""Good"". No.
11. **Respondent 14**: Background (history) is 2. Comments mention ""Late response..."", no 'Clear'.
12. **Respondent 1**: Background (history) is 2. Comments say ""Satisfactory"". No.

Wait, none of the respondents have a score of 0 in 'Background (history)'. Let me double-check each one again. 

Looking through all respondents again, I see that Respondent 3 has a score of 0 in 'Identification', but 'Background (history)' is 3. All other respondents have 'Background (history)' scores of 2 or 3. There's no respondent with a 0 in 'Background (history)'. 

Therefore, even if their comments had 'Clear', since the score isn't 0, they don't count. Since there are no respondents with a 0 in 'Background (history)', the count is 0.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 'Background (history)' is greater than 5.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents whose total score for 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 'Background (history)' is greater than 5. 

First, I need to make sure I understand the data structure. The XML data has a 'questions' section that defines each question's ID and the rubric, and a 'responses' section with each respondent's answers. 

Looking at the questions, 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' has a rubric from 0 to 3, and 'Background (history)' also has a rubric from 0 to 3. The maximum possible sum for both would be 6 (3+3), so the total needs to be greater than 5. That means the sum has to be exactly 6, since 5 is the next lower integer.

Now, I need to go through each respondent and check their scores for these two questions. Let's list out all respondents and their scores:

Respondent 14:
- Background (history): 2
- Recommendation (global rating scale): 2
Sum: 4 → Not greater than 5.

Respondent 6:
- Background (history): 3
- GRS: 3
Sum: 6 → Yes.

Respondent 2:
- Background (history): 2
- GRS: 1
Sum: 3 → No.

Respondent 13:
- Background (history): 2
- GRS: 2
Sum: 4 → No.

Respondent 16:
- Background (history): 3
- GRS: 3
Sum: 6 → Yes.

Respondent 22:
- Background (history): 3
- GRS: 3
Sum: 6 → Yes.

Respondent 10:
- Background (history): 2
- GRS: 2
Sum: 4 → No.

So, respondents 6, 16, and 22 meet the criteria. That's a total of 3 respondents.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Background (history)' and 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is greater than 3.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents whose total score for 'Background (history)' and 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is greater than 3. 

First, I need to make sure I understand the data structure. The XML data has a 'questions' section that defines each question and their scoring rubrics, and a 'responses' section with each respondent's answers. 

Looking at the questions, 'Background (history)' has a rubric from 0 to 3, and 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' also has a rubric from 0 to 3. The task is to sum the scores of these two questions for each respondent and count how many have a total greater than 3.

Now, I'll go through each respondent in the responses section and check their scores for these two questions. 

Starting with respondent id=""1"":
- Background (history): 2
- Recommendation (global rating scale): 2
Sum: 2 + 2 = 4. 4 is greater than 3, so this one counts.

Next, respondent id=""10"":
- Background (history): 2
- Recommendation (global rating scale): 2
Sum: 2 + 2 = 4. Also counts.

Respondent id=""19"":
- Background (history): 3
- Recommendation (global rating scale): 3
Sum: 3 + 3 = 6. Definitely counts.

Respondent id=""20"":
- Background (history): 2
- Recommendation (global rating scale): 3
Sum: 2 + 3 = 5. Counts.

Respondent id=""4"":
- Background (history): 3
- Recommendation (global rating scale): 2
Sum: 3 + 2 = 5. Counts.

Wait, let me double-check each one to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 

Looking again:
- id1: 2+2=4 ✅
- id10: 2+2=4 ✅
- id19:3+3=6 ✅
- id20:2+3=5 ✅
- id4:3+2=5 ✅

All five respondents have a total greater than 3. But wait, the example given in the problem had an answer of 0, but that was for a different question. In this case, all respondents except maybe some? Let me check again.

Wait, looking at the data provided:

Wait, the data in the responses for each respondent:

Respondent 1:
- Background (history): 2
- Recommendation (global rating scale): 2 → sum 4

Respondent 10:
- Background (history): 2
- Recommendation (global rating scale): 2 → sum 4

Respondent 19:
- Background (history): 3
- Recommendation (global rating scale): 3 → sum 6

Respondent 20:
- Background (history): 2
- Recommendation (global rating scale): 3 → sum 5

Respondent 4:
- Background (history): 3
- Recommendation (global rating scale): 2 → sum 5

So all five respondents have a sum greater than 3. But wait, the data in the XML provided here might be the same as the example. Wait, looking back, the example's answer was 0, but that was for a different question (count on 2025-05-02 with score 1 on Background examination). 

In the current task, the sum is for 'Background (history)' and 'Recommendation (global rating scale)'. All five respondents have scores in these two fields that add up to 4, 4, 6, 5, 5 respectively. All of these are greater than 3. So the count should be 5. But wait, let me check if any of the answers have invalid scores. For example, in the example, there was a -1 in Identification. But in the current data, for these two questions, are there any negative scores?

Looking at the responses:

For 'Background (history)', all respondents have 2, 2, 3, 2, 3. No negatives here.

For 'Recommendation (global rating scale)', the scores are 2, 2, 3, 3, 2. Also no negatives. So all are valid. Therefore, all five respondents meet the condition. But wait, the data in the XML shows five respondents. Let me count again:

Respondent 1: sum 4 → yes
Respondent 10: sum 4 → yes
Respondent 19: sum 6 → yes
Respondent 20: sum 5 → yes
Respondent 4: sum 5 → yes

That's five respondents. But the XML shows five respondents in total. So the answer should be 5. But wait, the example had a different count. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the data. Let me check the XML again.

Looking at the XML provided in the current task:

Under responses, there are five respondents: id 1, 10, 19, 20, 4. Each of them has scores for the two questions. All of their sums are indeed greater than 3. Therefore, the count is 5. But the example's answer was 0, but that's a different question. So the correct answer here is 5.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who scored 2 on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and whose 'Comments' contain the word 'communication'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents who scored 2 on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and whose 'Comments' include the word 'communication'. 

First, I need to understand the structure of the data provided. The data is in XML format with a questionnaire that includes questions and responses. The questions section defines each question's ID and the possible answers, while the responses section contains the actual data from each respondent.

Looking at the 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' question, the rubric is:
0 = Not at all confident
1 = Confident but required extended questioning
2 = Confident but required some further questioning
3 = Confident and required little or no questioning

So, we need respondents who have a score of 2 here. That translates to ""Confident but required some further questioning"".

Next, the 'Comments' field is open-ended, and we need to check if it contains the word 'communication' (case-insensitive, I assume). 

Now, I'll go through each respondent in the responses section and check these two conditions.

Starting with respondent id=""10"":
- Recommendation (global rating scale): 2 → meets the score condition.
- Comments: ""Time: (15:53-16:14)"" → no mention of 'communication'. So, exclude.

Respondent id=""15"":
- Score: 2 → meets.
- Comments: ""Detailed Response - clear communication"" → contains 'communication'. So, count this one.

Respondent id=""21"":
- Score: 3 → doesn't meet. Skip.

Respondent id=""18"":
- Score: 2 → meets.
- Comments: ""Not very concise or clear communication"" → has 'communication'. Count.

Respondent id=""17"":
- Score: 2 → meets.
- Comments: ""Concise - clear"" → no 'communication'. Exclude.

Respondent id=""16"":
- Score: 3 → no. Skip.

Respondent id=""5"":
- Score: 3 → no. Skip.

Respondent id=""22"":
- Score: 3 → no. Skip.

Respondent id=""19"":
- Score: 3 → no. Skip.

Respondent id=""4"":
- Score: 2 → meets.
- Comments: ""Clinical handover and communication skills, satisfactory"" → has 'communication'. Count.

Wait, let me double-check each one again to ensure I didn't miss any.

Looking back:

id=""15"": Comments have 'communication' → yes.
id=""18"": Comments mention 'communication' → yes.
id=""4"": Comments include 'communication' → yes.

Wait, id=""4"" has a score of 2 for Recommendation (global rating scale)? Let me check the data again.

Looking at respondent id=""4"":
<answer question=""Recommendation (global rating scale)"">2</answer>
Yes, score is 2. And comments include 'communication'.

So that's three respondents: 15, 18, and 4. Wait, but let me check again.

Wait, id=""15"" has 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' as 2? Let me confirm:

Respondent id=""15"":
<answer question=""Recommendation (global rating scale)"">2</answer> → yes.

So, three respondents: 15, 18, and 4. Wait, but in the data, let's check each:

Wait, id=""15"" is correct. id=""18"" has score 2 and comments with 'communication'. id=""4"" has score 2 and comments with 'communication'. Are there any others?

Wait, respondent id=""5"" has a score of 3, so no. Respondent id=""17"" has score 2 but comments don't have 'communication'. So total of three? Wait, but let me check again.

Wait, the initial count:

- id=""15"": yes
- id=""18"": yes
- id=""4"": yes

That's three. But wait, let me check the data again for each:

id=""15"":
<answer question=""Recommendation (global rating scale)"">2</answer>
Comments: ""Detailed Response - clear communication"" → yes.

id=""18"":
<answer question=""Recommendation (global rating scale)"">2</answer>
Comments: ""Not very concise or clear communication"" → yes.

id=""4"":
<answer question=""Recommendation (global rating scale)"">2</answer>
Comments: ""Clinical handover and communication skills, satisfactory"" → yes.

So that's three respondents. But wait, the example given in the problem had an answer of 0, but that was for a different query. So in this case, the correct answer should be 3. But let me check again to make sure I didn't miss any.

Wait, let me check all respondents again:

1. id=""10"": score 2, comments no → no
2. id=""15"": score 2, comments yes → count
3. id=""21"": score 3 → no
4. id=""18"": score 2, comments yes → count
5. id=""17"": score 2, comments no → no
6. id=""16"": score 3 → no
7. id=""5"": score 3 → no
8. id=""22"": score 3 → no
9. id=""19"": score 3 → no
10. id=""4"": score 2, comments yes → count

Total of 3 respondents. So the answer should be 3.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Identification' and 'Assessment' is greater than 6.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents whose total score for 'Identification' and 'Assessment' is greater than 6. 

First, I need to understand the structure of the data provided. The XML has a questionnaire with questions and responses. Each respondent has answers to various questions, each identified by an ID. The relevant questions here are 'Identification' and 'Assessment'. 

Looking at the questions section, 'Identification' has a rubric from 0 to 3. Similarly, 'Assessment' is also scored from 0 to 3. The total possible score for both combined would be 6 (3+3). The task is to find respondents where the sum of these two scores is greater than 6. Wait, but the maximum possible is 6. So if the sum needs to be greater than 6, that's impossible. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me check the data again.

Wait, looking at the example given in the problem, the answer was 0. The example asked for respondents on '2025-05-02' with a score of 1 on 'Background (examination)'. The data showed that respondent 1 had a score of 2 on that date, so the answer was 0. So the example's logic was correct.

Now, back to the current task. The sum of 'Identification' and 'Assessment' must be greater than 6. But each can be up to 3, so the maximum sum is 6. Therefore, no respondent can have a sum greater than 6. But wait, let me check the actual data to confirm.

Looking at the responses:

Respondent 11: Identification=3, Assessment=3 → sum=6
Respondent 6: 3 and 2 → 5
Respondent 15: 3 and 2 →5
Respondent 9:3 and 2 →5
Respondent 22:3 and 2 →5
Respondent 1: -1 and 3 →2
Respondent 23:3 and 3 →6
Respondent 10:2 and 2 →4

So the highest sum is 6 (respondents 11 and 23). Since the task is to count those with sum >6, which is impossible, the answer should be 0. But wait, maybe there's a mistake in the rubric? Let me check the question definitions again.

The 'Identification' rubric goes up to 3. 'Assessment' also up to 3. So 3+3=6. Therefore, no one can have a sum greater than 6. Hence, the count is 0.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents from the 'V (Hypoglycemia)' session who scored 0 on 'Identification' and 1 on 'Assessment'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents from the 'V (Hypoglycemia)' session who scored 0 on 'Identification' and 1 on 'Assessment'. 

First, I need to understand the structure of the data provided. The data is in XML format with a questionnaire that includes questions and responses. The questions section defines each question's ID and the rubric for scoring. The responses section contains individual respondents with their answers to each question.

The task has three main criteria:
1. The session name must be 'V (Hypoglycemia)'.
2. The score for 'Identification' must be 0.
3. The score for 'Assessment' must be 1.

I'll start by locating all respondents in the 'V (Hypoglycemia)' session. Looking through the responses, each respondent has a 'SessionName' answer. I need to check each respondent's 'SessionName' to see if it matches exactly 'V (Hypoglycemia)'.

Next, for those respondents in the correct session, I need to check their scores for 'Identification' and 'Assessment'. According to the questions schema, 'Identification' has a rubric where 0 means ""Requires direct prompting"" and 'Assessment' has a rubric where 1 means ""Assessment only after extended questioning"".

Now, let's go through each respondent in the data:

- Respondent 22: SessionName is ""IV (VT)"" – not matching.
- Respondent 7: ""III-Sepsis"" – no.
- Respondent 6: ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"" – no.
- Respondent 20: ""IV (VT)"" – no.
- Respondent 13: ""I-VF"" – no.
- Respondent 14: ""IV-Hypoglycemia"" – close but not exactly 'V (Hypoglycemia)'.
- Respondent 17: SessionName is ""V (Hypoglycemia)"". Let's check their scores. Identification is 3, which is above 0. So this doesn't meet the criteria.
- Respondent 11: ""IV (AF)"" – no.
- Respondent 2: ""MI"" – no.
- Respondent 23: ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" – no.
- Respondent 16: ""I - MI"" – no.
- Respondent 15: ""III - Sepsis"" – no.

Only respondent 17 is in the 'V (Hypoglycemia)' session. Now check their 'Identification' and 'Assessment' scores. 

For respondent 17:
- Identification: 3 (needs to be 0)
- Assessment: 3 (needs to be 1)

Since neither of these scores meet the required 0 and 1, there are no respondents that satisfy all three conditions. Therefore, the count is 0.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents from the 'IV (AF)' session who scored 0 on 'Background (examination)' and 2 on 'Identification'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents from the 'IV (AF)' session who scored 0 on 'Background (examination)' and 2 on 'Identification'. 

First, I need to go through each respondent in the data and check if they meet all three conditions: their session name is 'IV (AF)', their score for 'Background (examination)' is 0, and their score for 'Identification' is 2.

Looking at the responses section, I'll start by checking each respondent one by one.

Respondent 5: SessionName is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" – not IV (AF). Skip.

Respondent 16: SessionName is ""I - MI"" – nope.

Respondent 11: SessionName is ""IV (AF)"". Now check their scores. Background (examination) is 3, which isn't 0. So they don't qualify.

Respondent 8: Session is III (Sepsis). Not relevant.

Respondent 1: Session is V (Hypoglycemia). No.

Respondent 9: Session is II (Anaphylaxsis). Not IV (AF).

Respondent 13: Session is I-VF. Doesn't match.

Respondent 20: Session is IV (VT). Close, but not AF.

Respondent 22: Session is IV (VT) again. Not AF.

So, among all respondents, only respondent 11 has the session name 'IV (AF)'. However, their Background (examination) score is 3, not 0, and their Identification is 3, not 2. Therefore, there are no respondents that meet all three criteria. The count should be 0.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents from the 'II-Anaphylaxsis' session who scored 0 on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 2 on 'Situation'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents from the 'II-Anaphylaxsis' session who scored 0 on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 2 on 'Situation'. 

First, I need to understand the structure of the data provided. The dataset has a 'questions' section that defines each question and its possible answers, and a 'responses' section with individual respondent data. 

Looking at the 'SessionName' question, the session in question is 'II-Anaphylaxsis'. I need to filter all respondents where the 'SessionName' is exactly 'II-Anaphylaxsis'. 

Next, for each of those respondents, I need to check two scores: 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' should be 0, and 'Situation' should be 2. 

Let me go through each respondent in the responses. The respondents are listed with their IDs and answers. I'll start by checking each one's 'SessionName' first.

Looking at respondent id=""23"": Their 'SessionName' is 'II-Anaphylaxsis', which matches. Now, check their 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' score. The answer there is 3. That's not 0, so this respondent doesn't qualify. 

Next, respondent id=""9"": Their 'SessionName' is 'II (Anaphylaxsis)'. The task specifies 'II-Anaphylaxsis', but the parentheses and spacing might be different. Wait, the exact session name in the data for id=""23"" is 'II-Anaphylaxsis' (without space and with a hyphen), while id=""9"" has 'II (Anaphylaxsis)' with parentheses and a space. Are these considered the same? The task is looking for the exact 'II-Anaphylaxsis' session, so only respondent 23's session name matches exactly. Respondent 9's session name is written differently, so they might not be included. 

But wait, maybe there's a typo or variation in the session names. Let me check all respondents. 

Looking through all the responses:

- id=""10"": SessionName is ""(MI)-VT""
- id=""19"": ""I - MI""
- id=""21"": ""I (Myocardial infarction)""
- id=""1"": ""V (Hypoglycemia)""
- id=""9"": ""II (Anaphylaxsis)""
- id=""12"": ""II (Anaphylaxis)""
- id=""8"": ""III (Sepsis)""
- id=""20"": ""IV (VT)""
- id=""23"": ""II-Anaphylaxsis""

So, only respondent 23 has the exact 'II-Anaphylaxsis' session name. The others with Anaphylaxis-related sessions have different formatting. Therefore, only respondent 23 is part of the 'II-Anaphylaxsis' session. 

Now, check their scores. For respondent 23:

- 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is 3, which is not 0. 
- 'Situation' is 3. 

So, even though the session name matches, the scores don't meet the criteria. 

Are there any other respondents with session names that might be considered 'II-Anaphylaxsis' despite formatting differences? For example, respondent id=""9"" has 'II (Anaphylaxsis)' and id=""12"" has 'II (Anaphylaxis)'. The spelling in the task is 'Anaphylaxsis' with two 's's. Let me check the exact spelling in the data. 

In the task, the session name is 'II-Anaphylaxsis'. Respondent 23's session is 'II-Anaphylaxsis', while respondent 9's is 'II (Anaphylaxsis)' (with one 's' in Anaphylaxsis? Wait, no. Wait, the spelling in the data for respondent 9 is 'Anaphylaxsis'? Let me check:

Respondent 9's SessionName: ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"" – yes, that's spelled with two 's's. So 'Anaphylaxsis' vs. 'Anaphylaxis' (which is the correct medical term, but the data might have a typo). The task specifies 'II-Anaphylaxsis', which matches respondent 23's session name. However, respondent 9's session is 'II (Anaphylaxsis)' with parentheses and a space, but the same spelling. 

Wait, the task says 'II-Anaphylaxsis' session. The hyphen vs. parentheses might be a formatting difference. But in the data, respondent 9's session is 'II (Anaphylaxsis)' and respondent 23's is 'II-Anaphylaxsis'. Are these considered the same session? The task is case-sensitive and exact in matching. Since the session names are different in formatting (hyphen vs. parentheses and space), they are considered different. Therefore, only respondent 23 is in 'II-Anaphylaxsis' session. 

But let's confirm. The task is to count respondents from the 'II-Anaphylaxsis' session. So only respondent 23. Now, check their scores. 

For respondent 23:

- 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is 3 (answer is 3)
- 'Situation' is 3 (answer is 3)

So neither of the required scores (0 and 2) are met. Therefore, there are zero respondents meeting both criteria. 

Wait, but maybe I missed other respondents. Let me check all respondents again. 

Looking through all respondents:

- id=""23"": SessionName 'II-Anaphylaxsis', GRS 3, Situation 3 → no
- id=""9"": SessionName 'II (Anaphylaxsis)', GRS 2, Situation 3 → no
- id=""12"": SessionName 'II (Anaphylaxis)', GRS 3, Situation 3 → no

No other respondents have the exact session name. Therefore, even if we consider possible typos or variations, there are no respondents in the specified session with the required scores. 

Thus, the count is 0.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents from the 'IV (VT)' session who scored 1 on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 0 on 'Background (examination)'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents from the 'IV (VT)' session who scored 1 on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 0 on 'Background (examination)'. 

First, I need to understand the structure of the data provided. The dataset is in XML format with a list of questions and responses. Each respondent has answers to various questions, each identified by an ID and a question tag.

Starting with the questions section, I should note the IDs and their corresponding questions to ensure I'm looking at the right data. The relevant questions here are 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 'Background (examination)'. The 'SessionName' is also crucial because we need to filter respondents from the 'IV (VT)' session.

Next, I'll go through each respondent in the responses section. For each respondent, I need to check three things:
1. Their 'SessionName' is exactly 'IV (VT)'.
2. Their score for 'Background (examination)' is 0.
3. Their score for 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is 1.

Looking at the respondents one by one:

- **Respondent 15**: SessionName is ""III - Sepsis"". Not IV (VT). Skip.
- **Respondent 10**: SessionName is ""(MI)-VT"". Not IV (VT). Skip.
- **Respondent 6**: SessionName is ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"". Skip.
- **Respondent 13**: SessionName is ""I-VF"". Skip.
- **Respondent 17**: SessionName is ""V (Hypoglycemia)"". Skip.
- **Respondent 22**: SessionName is ""IV (VT)"". Let's check the scores. 
  - 'Background (examination)' is 3. Doesn't match 0. So, no.
- **Respondent 4**: SessionName is ""III (Sepsis)"". Skip.
- **Respondent 18**: SessionName is ""IV - VT"". Wait, the task specifies 'IV (VT)', but this respondent's SessionName is ""IV - VT"". The parentheses are replaced with a hyphen. However, in the data, there's another respondent (22) with ""IV (VT)"". So, the exact match is important. Since the task says 'IV (VT)', respondent 18's session name is ""IV - VT"", which is different. So, this one doesn't count either.

Wait, but maybe I should check if there's any other respondent with SessionName ""IV (VT)"". Respondent 22 has ""IV (VT)"", but their 'Background (examination)' is 3 and 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is 3. So, they don't meet the criteria of 0 and 1.

Looking again, there's no respondent with SessionName exactly ""IV (VT)"" who has 0 on Background (examination) and 1 on Recommendation (global rating scale). The only possible candidate is respondent 18, but their SessionName is ""IV - VT"", which might be a typo or variation. However, the task specifies 'IV (VT)', so unless the hyphen is considered equivalent, which it's not in exact matches, this doesn't count. 

Additionally, checking their scores: respondent 18's 'Background (examination)' is 2 and 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is 2. So, they don't meet the required scores either.

Therefore, after checking all respondents, there are none that meet all three criteria. The count should be 0.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Assessment' and 'Identification' is greater than 6.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents whose total score for 'Assessment' and 'Identification' is greater than 6. 

First, I need to understand where these two questions are in the data. The 'Assessment' and 'Identification' are question IDs in the questionnaire. Each respondent has an answer for these, which are numerical scores.

Looking at the schema in the questions section:
- 'Identification' has a rubric with scores from 0 to 3.
- 'Assessment' also has a rubric with scores from 0 to 3.

So, each of these can contribute up to 3 points. The maximum combined score would be 6 (3+3). The task is to find respondents where the sum of these two scores is greater than 6. Wait, that's impossible because 3+3=6. So, if the sum has to be greater than 6, that would require each to be 3.5 or more, but the scores are integers. Therefore, the only way the sum is greater than 6 is if the total is 7 or higher. But since each can only be up to 3, the maximum possible sum is 6. Therefore, there are no respondents who meet this condition. 

Wait, that can't be right. Let me check again. Oh, wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me recalculate. If 'Assessment' and 'Identification' each can be 3, then 3+3=6. The problem says ""greater than 6"", which would require a sum of 7 or more. But since the maximum possible is 6, there are no respondents with a sum greater than 6. Therefore, the answer should be 0.

But let me verify by checking each respondent's scores to be sure. Let's go through each respondent in the responses:

Respondent 20:
- Identification: 3
- Assessment: 3
Total: 6 → Not greater than 6.

Respondent 8:
- Identification: 3
- Assessment: 2
Total: 5 → No.

Respondent 22:
- Identification: 3
- Assessment: 2 → Total 5.

Respondent 5:
- Identification:3, Assessment:3 → 6.

Respondent 16:
- Identification:3, Assessment:3 → 6.

Respondent 23:
- Identification:3, Assessment:3 → 6.

Respondent 15:
- Identification:3, Assessment:2 → 5.

Respondent 12:
- Identification:3, Assessment:2 → 5.

Respondent 7:
- Identification:3, Assessment:2 →5.

Respondent 19:
- Identification:3, Assessment:2 →5.

All respondents have a sum of 6 or less. Therefore, none have a total greater than 6. The count is 0.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Identification' and 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is greater than 5.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents whose total score for 'Identification' and 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is greater than 5. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The questionnaire has a list of questions, each with an ID and a rubric. The responses are from various respondents, each with answers to these questions.

The two questions in focus here are 'Identification' and 'Recommendation (global rating scale)'. Let me check their rubrics to confirm the scoring. 

Looking at the 'Identification' question: the rubric is 0 to 3. So possible scores are 0, 1, 2, or 3. 

For 'Recommendation (global rating scale)', the rubric is also 0 to 3. So each of these two questions can contribute up to 3 points each. 

The total of these two would be the sum of their scores. The task is to find respondents where this sum is greater than 5. Since each can be up to 3, the maximum possible sum is 6. So a sum greater than 5 would mean the sum is 6. Because 3 + 3 = 6, which is the only combination that gives a total over 5.

Now, I need to go through each respondent and check their scores for these two questions. 

Let's list out all respondents and their scores:

Respondent 16:
- Identification: 3
- GRS: 3
Total: 6 → meets the condition.

Respondent 18:
- Identification: 3
- GRS: 2
Total: 5 → doesn't meet.

Respondent 7:
- Identification: 3
- GRS: 2
Total: 5 → no.

Respondent 8:
- Identification: 3
- GRS: 3
Total: 6 → yes.

Respondent 3:
- Identification: 0
- GRS: 3
Total: 3 → no.

Respondent 17:
- Identification: 3
- GRS: 2
Total: 5 → no.

Respondent 15:
- Identification: 3
- GRS: 2
Total: 5 → no.

Respondent 12:
- Identification: 3
- GRS: 3
Total: 6 → yes.

Respondent 2:
- Identification: 3
- GRS: 1
Total: 4 → no.

Respondent 10:
- Identification: 2
- GRS: 2
Total: 4 → no.

Respondent 22:
- Identification: 3
- GRS: 3
Total: 6 → yes.

Respondent 1:
- Identification: -1 (Wait, the rubric for Identification is 0-3. But this respondent has -1. Maybe a typo, but according to the data, it's -1. So total would be -1 + 2 = 1 → no.)

Now, let's count the respondents with total 6. From the list above:

Respondent 16: 6
Respondent 8: 6
Respondent 12: 6
Respondent 22: 6

That's four respondents. Wait, let me check again.

Wait, in the data, respondent 3 has Identification 0 and GRS 3, total 3. Respondent 17: 3+2=5. Respondent 15: 3+2=5. Respondent 12: 3+3=6. Respondent 22: 3+3=6. 

So the ones that meet the condition are respondents 16, 8, 12, 22. That's four. 

Wait, but let me check each again:

Looking at the XML data:

Respondent 16:
<answer question=""Identification"">3</answer>
<answer question=""Recommendation (global rating scale)"">3</answer>
Total: 6.

Respondent 8:
<answer question=""Identification"">3</answer>
<answer question=""Recommendation (global rating scale)"">3</answer>
Total: 6.

Respondent 12:
<answer question=""Identification"">3</answer>
<answer question=""Recommendation (global rating scale)"">3</answer>
Total: 6.

Respondent 22:
<answer question=""Identification"">3</answer>
<answer question=""Recommendation (global rating scale)"">3</answer>
Total: 6.

So that's four respondents. 

Wait, but in the data, let me check again:

Looking at the XML responses:

- Respondent 16: yes.
- Respondent 8: yes.
- Respondent 12: yes.
- Respondent 22: yes.

Are there any others? Let's check all:

Respondent 3: GRS 3, but Identification 0. 0+3=3. No.

Respondent 17: GRS 2, Identification 3. 5. No.

Respondent 15: same as 17. No.

Respondent 2: GRS 1. No.

Respondent 10: GRS 2. No.

Respondent 1: GRS 2, Identification -1. No.

So total of 4 respondents. Therefore, the answer should be 4.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who scored 3 on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and whose 'Comments' contain the word 'Overall'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The goal is to count the respondents who scored 3 on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and have the word 'Overall' in their Comments. 

First, I need to understand the structure of the data provided. The XML has a 'questions' section that defines each question, including the 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and 'Comments'. The 'responses' section contains all the respondents' answers.

Starting with the 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' question. The rubric for this question is: 0 = No recommendation, 1 = Clear recommendation only after extended questioning, 2 = Clear recommendation after minimal questioning, 3 = Clear comprehensive recommendation without questioning. So, we need to find respondents who have a '3' in their answer for this question.

Next, the 'Comments' field is an open-ended question. We need to check if the text in this field contains the word 'Overall'. It's important to note that the search is case-sensitive unless specified, but the task doesn't mention case sensitivity, so I'll assume it's looking for the exact word as given. However, looking at the example provided in the data, the comments don't have the word 'Overall' in any of the entries. Wait, let me check each respondent's comments again.

Looking through each respondent's 'Comments' in the data:

- Respondent 17: ""Concise - clear Satisfactory"" – no 'Overall'.
- Respondent 7: ""Time: (1:00-1:17)"" – no.
- Respondent 19: ""Wrong CPR position Clarity is a bit low over whole case scenario Satisfactory"" – 'over' in 'over whole' but not 'Overall'.
- Respondent 18: ""Not very concise or clear communication Satisfactory"" – no.
- Respondent 5: ""Good clear and precise clinical handover Good"" – no.
- Respondent 6: (empty) – no.
- Respondent 11: ""Clear communication and handover"" – no.
- Respondent 15: ""Detailed Response - clear communication"" – no.
- Respondent 2: (empty) – no.
- Respondent 23: Comments mention ""Time: (11:43-11:58) Talking to registrav could not summarize the condition of patient very clearly DID: Sepsis I Anaphylaxsis given by team"" – no 'Overall'.
- Respondent 4: ""Clinical handover and communication skills, satisfactory No panic, no arrest team Satisfactory"" – no.
- Respondent 12: ""Good"" – no.

None of the comments include the word 'Overall'. Now, check which respondents have a score of 3 in 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)'. 

Looking at each respondent's answer for that question:

- Respondent 17: 3
- Respondent 7: 2
- Respondent 19: 3

- Respondent 11: 3
- Respondent 15: 2
- Respondent 2: 2
- Respondent 23: 3
- Respondent 4: 2
- Respondent 12: 3

So respondents 17, 19, 11, 23, and 12 have a score of 3. Now, check their comments for 'Overall'. As established earlier, none of these respondents have 'Overall' in their comments. Therefore, even though they scored 3, their comments don't contain the required word. 

Thus, the count is 0.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents from the 'I - MI' session who scored 0 on 'Identification' and 2 on 'Situation'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents from the 'I - MI' session who scored 0 on 'Identification' and 2 on 'Situation'. 

First, I need to understand the structure of the data provided. The data is in XML format with a list of respondents, each having answers to various questions. The questions section defines each question's ID and the rubric for scoring. 

The key steps here are:
1. Identify all respondents from the session named 'I - MI'.
2. For each of those respondents, check their scores for 'Identification' and 'Situation'.
3. Count how many of them have a score of 0 on 'Identification' and 2 on 'Situation'.

Starting with the first part: finding respondents in the 'I - MI' session. Looking through the responses, each respondent has an answer for the 'SessionName' under the question with id ""SessionName"". 

Looking at the data:
- Respondent 16 has SessionName ""I - MI"".
- Other respondents have different session names like ""III-Sepsis"", ""V (Hypoglycemia)"", etc. So only respondent 16 is in 'I - MI'.

Now, check respondent 16's scores. 
- Identification: The answer is 3. The rubric for Identification is 0-3, where 0 is the lowest. Since we need 0, this respondent doesn't meet that criteria.
- Situation: The answer is 3. We need a score of 2 here. 

So, even though respondent 16 is in the correct session, their scores don't match the required 0 and 2. 

Are there any other respondents in 'I - MI'? From the data provided, no. All other SessionNames are different. 

Therefore, there are zero respondents who meet all the specified conditions.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Situation' and 'Background (history)' is greater than 3.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents whose total score for 'Situation' and 'Background (history)' is greater than 3. 

First, I need to make sure I understand the data structure. The XML data has a 'questions' section that defines each question by its ID and the rubric. Then, the 'responses' section contains each respondent's answers to these questions.

Looking at the questions, 'Situation' has a rubric from 0 to 3, and 'Background (history)' also has a rubric from 0 to 3. The task is to sum these two scores for each respondent and count how many have a total greater than 3.

So, I need to go through each respondent in the responses, extract their scores for these two questions, add them together, and check if the sum exceeds 3. Then, count how many such respondents there are.

Let me start by listing all respondents and their scores for 'Situation' and 'Background (history)'.

Respondent 22:
- Situation: 3
- Background (history): 3
Sum: 6 (which is >3)

Respondent 10:
- Situation: 2
- Background (history): 2
Sum: 4 (>3)

Respondent 1:
- Situation: 2
- Background (history): 2
Sum: 4 (>3)

Respondent 13:
- Situation: 3
- Background (history): 2
Sum: 5 (>3)

Respondent 9:
- Situation: 3
- Background (history): 2
Sum: 5 (>3)

Respondent 21:
- Situation: 2
- Background (history): 3
Sum: 5 (>3)

Respondent 7:
- Situation: 3
- Background (history): 2
Sum: 5 (>3)

Respondent 3:
- Situation: 2
- Background (history): 3
Sum: 5 (>3)

Respondent 18:
- Situation: 3
- Background (history): 2
Sum: 5 (>3)

Respondent 17:
- Situation: 3
- Background (history): 3
Sum: 6 (>3)

Respondent 6:
- Situation: 2
- Background (history): 3
Sum: 5 (>3)

Now, let's count how many of these sums are greater than 3. Looking at each:

- Respondent 22: 6 >3 → yes
- Respondent 10: 4 >3 → yes
- Respondent 1: 4 >3 → yes
- Respondent 13:5 >3 → yes
- Respondent 9:5 → yes
- Respondent 21:5 → yes
- Respondent 7:5 → yes
- Respondent 3:5 → yes
- Respondent 18:5 → yes
- Respondent 17:6 → yes
- Respondent 6:5 → yes

That's all 11 respondents. Wait, but looking back at the data, there are 11 respondents in total. Let me check each again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, let's recount the respondents:

Looking at the XML, the respondents are id 22,10,1,13,9,21,7,3,18,17,6. That's 11 respondents. All of them have a sum of Situation and Background (history) scores greater than 3. But wait, let me check each again.

Wait, respondent 10: Situation=2, Background=2 → sum 4. Yes, 4>3. Correct.

Respondent 1: same as 10, sum 4. Correct.

Respondent 13: 3+2=5. Correct.

Respondent 9:3+2=5. Correct.

Respondent 21:2+3=5. Correct.

Respondent 7:3+2=5. Correct.

Respondent 3:2+3=5. Correct.

Respondent 18:3+2=5. Correct.

Respondent 17:3+3=6. Correct.

Respondent 6:2+3=5. Correct.

So all 11 respondents have a sum greater than 3. But wait, the example given in the problem had an answer of 0 for a different question, but that's a different task. For this task, according to the data, all respondents have a sum of Situation and Background (history) greater than 3. But that seems unlikely. Let me check again.

Wait, looking at the data again. Let's check each respondent's scores:

Respondent 22: Situation=3, Background (history)=3 → 6.

Respondent 10: Situation=2, Background (history)=2 → 4.

Respondent 1: Situation=2, Background (history)=2 →4.

Respondent 13: Situation=3, Background (history)=2 →5.

Respondent 9: Situation=3, Background (history)=2 →5.

Respondent 21: Situation=2, Background (history)=3 →5.

Respondent 7: Situation=3, Background (history)=2 →5.

Respondent 3: Situation=2, Background (history)=3 →5.

Respondent 18: Situation=3, Background (history)=2 →5.

Respondent 17: Situation=3, Background (history)=3 →6.

Respondent 6: Situation=2, Background (history)=3 →5.

Yes, all 11 respondents have a sum greater than 3. Therefore, the count is 11. But wait, the example in the problem had a similar structure and the answer was 0. But that was for a different question (date and specific score). So in this case, the answer should be 11. But let me check if any respondent has a sum less than or equal to 3.

Looking again:

Is there any respondent where Situation + Background (history) ≤3?

Looking at each:

- All sums are 4,5,6. So no one has a sum ≤3. Therefore, all 11 respondents meet the criteria. So the answer is 11.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose 'Identification' is higher than the average 'Identification' for all sessions on the same date.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents whose 'Identification' score is higher than the average 'Identification' score for all sessions on the same date. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The XML has a list of respondents, each with various answers, including the 'Date' and 'Identification' scores. The 'Identification' question uses a rubric from 0 to 3. 

So, the plan is:
1. For each respondent, note their date and Identification score.
2. For each date, calculate the average Identification score of all respondents on that date.
3. Compare each respondent's Identification score to the average of their respective date.
4. Count how many respondents have a score higher than their date's average.

Let me start by extracting all the respondents with their dates and Identification scores. Let's list them out:

- Respondent 18: Date 2025-05-04, Identification 3
- Respondent 2: 2025-04-04, 3
- Respondent 3: 2025-04-04, 0
- Respondent 16: 2025-05-02, 3
- Respondent 22: 2025-05-16, 3
- Respondent 10: 2025-03-14, 2
- Respondent 14: 2025-03-14, 3
- Respondent 6: 2025-04-04, 3

Now, group them by date:

2025-03-14: Respondents 10 (2), 14 (3)
2025-04-04: Respondents 2 (3), 3 (0), 6 (3)
2025-05-02: Respondent 16 (3)
2025-05-04: Respondent 18 (3)
2025-05-16: Respondent 22 (3)

Next, calculate the average for each date:

For 2025-03-14: (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5
For 2024-04-04: (3 + 0 + 3)/3 = 6/3 = 2
For 2025-05-02: 3/1 = 3
For 2025-05-04: 3/1 = 3
For 2025-05-16: 3/1 = 3

Now, compare each respondent's score to their date's average:

2025-03-14:
- Respondent 10: 2 vs 2.5 → 2 < 2.5 → no
- Respondent 14: 3 vs 2.5 → 3 > 2.5 → yes

2025-04-04:
- Respondent 2: 3 vs 2 → yes
- Respondent 3: 0 vs 2 → no
- Respondent 6: 3 vs 2 → yes

2025-05-02:
- Respondent 16: 3 vs 3 → equal, not higher → no

2025-05-04:
- Respondent 18: 3 vs 3 → no

2025-05-16:
- Respondent 22: 3 vs 3 → no

So, the respondents who meet the criteria are:
- Respondent 14 (2025-03-14)
- Respondent 2 (2025-04-04)
- Respondent 6 (2025-04-04)

That's a total of 3 respondents. Wait, let me double-check:

Wait, 2025-04-04's average is 2. So respondents 2 and 6 scored 3, which is higher than 2. So that's two on that date. Respondent 14 is another. So total 3. Yes. So the answer should be 3.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score across all rubric items is below the average total score for all sessions.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents whose total score across all rubric items is below the average total score for all sessions. 

First, I need to understand which questions are rubric-based. Looking at the questions section, the rubric items are: Identification, Situation, Background (history), Background (examination), Assessment, Recommendation (clear recommendation), and Recommendation (global rating scale). Each of these has a rubric from 0 to 3. The other questions (Date, SessionName, Comments) are open-ended and don't contribute to the score.

Next, I need to calculate the total score for each respondent by summing their scores across all rubric items. Let's list out each respondent and their scores:

Respondent 21:
- Identification: 3
- Situation: 2
- Background (history): 3
- Background (examination): 1
- Assessment: 2
- Recommendation (clear recommendation): 3
- Recommendation (GRS): 3
Total: 3+2+3+1+2+3+3 = 17

Respondent 23:
- All rubric items: 3,3,2,2,3,3,3
Total: 3+3+2+2+3+3+3 = 19

Respondent 14:
- Scores: 3,3,2,2,3,1,2
Total: 3+3+2+2+3+1+2 = 16

Respondent 12:
- Scores: 3,3,3,3,2,3,3
Total: 3+3+3+3+2+3+3 = 20

Respondent 13:
- Scores: 3,3,2,1,2,2,2
Total: 3+3+2+1+2+2+2 = 15

Respondent 15:
- Scores: 3,3,2,3,2,2,2
Total: 3+3+2+3+2+2+2 = 17

Respondent 19:
- Scores: 3,3,3,3,2,3,3
Total: 3+3+3+3+2+3+3 = 20

Respondent 17:
- Scores: 3,3,3,3,3,3,2
Total: 3+3+3+3+3+3+2 = 20

Respondent 2:
- Scores: 3,3,2,3,3,2,1
Total: 3+3+2+3+3+2+1 = 17

Now, let's list all the totals: 17, 19, 16, 20, 15, 17, 20, 20, 17. 

Calculating the average total score: sum all totals and divide by the number of respondents (9). 

Sum = 17 + 19 + 16 + 20 + 15 + 17 + 20 + 20 + 17 = 161. 

Average = 161 / 9 ≈ 17.89.

Now, find which respondents have totals below 17.89. 

Looking at the totals:
- 17 (Respondents 21, 15, 2)
- 16 (Respondent 14)
- 15 (Respondent 13)

So, the respondents with totals below the average are 21, 14, 13, 15, 2. Wait, wait. Wait, 17 is exactly 17, which is below 17.89. So 17 is below the average. So the totals below 17.89 are 15,16,17. Let me check each:

Respondent 13: 15 (below)
Respondent 14: 16 (below)
Respondent 21: 17 (17 < 17.89? Yes, since 17.89 is approximately 17.89, so 17 is below)
Respondent 15: 17 (same as 21)
Respondent 2: 17 (same)

Wait, the sum was 161, divided by 9 is 17.888..., so 17.89 when rounded. So any total less than 17.89 would be 17 and below. Wait, 17 is less than 17.89. So all respondents with total 17 or lower. Let's check each:

Respondent 21: 17 → below
Respondent 14: 16 → below
Respondent 13: 15 → below
Respondent 15: 17 → below
Respondent 2: 17 → below

Wait, but the totals are:

Respondent 21: 17
Respondent 23: 19
Respondent 14: 16
Respondent 12: 20
Respondent 13: 15
Respondent 15: 17
Respondent 19: 20
Respondent 17: 20
Respondent 2: 17

So the totals below 17.89 are 15,16,17. So respondents with totals 15,16,17. Let's count how many:

- 15: 1 (respondent 13)
- 16: 1 (respondent 14)
- 17: 3 (respondents 21, 15, 2)

Total of 1+1+3=5 respondents.

Wait, but the average is approximately 17.89. So any total less than that would be 17 and below. So 17 is included. So the count is 5.

But let me verify the sum again. Let's add all totals:

17 +19=36; +16=52; +20=72; +15=87; +17=104; +20=124; +20=144; +17=161. Yes, sum is 161. 161/9=17.888... So average is ~17.89.

So respondents with total <17.89 are those with total ≤17. So how many?

Looking at each:

- 21:17 → yes
- 23:19 → no
-14:16 → yes
-12:20 → no
-13:15 → yes
-15:17 → yes
-19:20 → no
-17:20 → no
-2:17 → yes

That's 21,14,13,15,2 → 5 respondents. So the answer should be 5.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the respondents whose 'Background (examination)' score is equal to the average 'Background (examination)' score for all sessions that occurred on the same date.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents whose 'Background (examination)' score is equal to the average 'Background (examination)' score for all sessions that occurred on the same date. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The XML data has a list of respondents, each with answers to various questions, including the date of the session and the score for 'Background (examination)'. 

The plan is:
1. For each respondent, determine their date and 'Background (examination)' score.
2. For each date, calculate the average 'Background (examination)' score of all respondents on that date.
3. Compare each respondent's score to the average of their respective date.
4. Count how many respondents have a score equal to the average of their date.

Let me start by extracting all the respondents and their relevant data. Looking at the responses section, each respondent has an answer for 'Date' and 'Background (examination)'. 

First, I'll list out all respondents with their dates and 'Background (examination)' scores:

- Respondent 5: Date 2025-05-04, score 3
- Respondent 21: Date 2025-05-16, score 1
- Respondent 12: Date 2025-05-02, score 3
- Respondent 4: Date 2025-05-16, score 2
- Respondent 6: Date 2025-04-04, score 3
- Respondent 18: Date 2025-05-04, score 2
- Respondent 13: Date 2025-03-14, score 1
- Respondent 23: Date 2025-03-14, score 2
- Respondent 22: Date 2025-05-16, score 3
- Respondent 20: Date 2025-05-02, score -1
- Respondent 1: Date 2025-05-02, score 2
- Respondent 17: Date 2025-05-04, score 3

Now, group them by date:

2025-03-14:
- Respondent 13: 1
- Respondent 23: 2
Average = (1 + 2) / 2 = 1.5

2025-04-04:
- Respondent 6: 3
Average = 3 (only one respondent)

2025-05-02:
- Respondent 12: 3
- Respondent 20: -1
- Respondent 1: 2
Scores: 3, -1, 2. Sum is 4. Average = 4 / 3 ≈ 1.333...

2025-05-04:
- Respondent 5: 3
- Respondent 18: 2
- Respondent 17: 3
Scores: 3, 2, 3. Sum is 8. Average ≈ 2.666...

2025-05-16:
- Respondent 21: 1
- Respondent 4: 2
- Respondent 22: 3
Scores: 1, 2, 3. Sum is 6. Average = 2

Next, for each respondent, check if their score equals the average of their date's group.

Let's go through each:

2025-03-14 (avg 1.5):
- Respondent 13: 1 → 1 ≠ 1.5 → no
- Respondent 23: 2 → 2 ≠ 1.5 → no

2025-04-04 (avg 3):
- Respondent 6: 3 → 3 = 3 → yes

2025-05-02 (avg ~1.333):
- Respondent 12: 3 → no
- Respondent 20: -1 → no
- Respondent 1: 2 → no

2025-05-04 (avg ~2.666):
- Respondent 5: 3 → no
- Respondent 18: 2 → 2 vs 2.666 → no
- Respondent 17: 3 → no

2025-05-16 (avg 2):
- Respondent 21: 1 → no
- Respondent 4: 2 → yes
- Respondent 22: 3 → no

So the respondents who meet the condition are Respondent 6 (date 2025-04-04) and Respondent 4 (date 2025-05-16). That's a total of 2 respondents.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who participated in a session where the average 'Assessment' for that session name is greater than 1.5.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents who participated in a session where the average 'Assessment' score for that session name is greater than 1.5. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The XML data has a list of respondents, each with answers to various questions, including 'SessionName' and 'Assessment'. The 'Assessment' question uses a rubric with scores from 0 to 3. 

The key steps here are:
1. Group all respondents by their 'SessionName'.
2. For each session group, calculate the average 'Assessment' score.
3. Identify which sessions have an average 'Assessment' greater than 1.5.
4. Count all respondents that are part of those sessions.

Let me start by listing all the respondents and their corresponding 'SessionName' and 'Assessment' scores. 

Looking at the data:

- Respondent 15: SessionName ""III - Sepsis"", Assessment 2
- Respondent 22: SessionName ""IV (VT)"", Assessment 2
- Respondent 18: SessionName ""IV - VT"", Assessment 3
- Respondent 14: SessionName ""IV-Hypoglycemia"", Assessment 3
- Respondent 21: SessionName ""I (Myocardial infarction)"", Assessment 2
- Respondent 13: SessionName ""I-VF"", Assessment 2
- Respondent 8: SessionName ""III (Sepsis)"", Assessment 2
- Respondent 17: SessionName ""V (Hypoglycemia)"", Assessment 3
- Respondent 16: SessionName ""I - MI"", Assessment 3
- Respondent 6: SessionName ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"", Assessment 2

Wait, I need to check if some session names are the same but written differently. For example, ""III - Sepsis"" vs. ""III (Sepsis)"" – are these considered the same session? The problem states ""session name"", so I should treat them as different if the names differ. Similarly, ""IV (VT)"" and ""IV - VT"" might be the same session but named differently. However, the exact session names in the data must be considered as distinct unless they are identical. 

But looking at the data, let's list all unique session names as per their exact names:

1. III - Sepsis (Respondent 15)
2. IV (VT) (Respondent 22)
3. IV - VT (Respondent 18)
4. IV-Hypoglycemia (Respondent 14)
5. I (Myocardial infarction) (Respondent 21)
6. I-VF (Respondent 13)
7. III (Sepsis) (Respondent 8)
8. V (Hypoglycemia) (Respondent 17)
9. I - MI (Respondent 16)
10. II (Anaphylactic Shock) (Respondent 6)

Now, group respondents by their exact session names and calculate the average 'Assessment' for each group.

Let's process each session:

1. III - Sepsis: Only respondent 15 with Assessment 2. Average = 2.0
2. IV (VT): Respondent 22 with Assessment 2. Average = 2.0
3. IV - VT: Respondent 18 with Assessment 3. Average = 3.0
4. IV-Hypoglycemia: Respondent 14 with Assessment 3. Average = 3.0
5. I (Myocardial infarction): Respondent 21 with Assessment 2. Average = 2.0
6. I-VF: Respondent 13 with Assessment 2. Average = 2.0
7. III (Sepsis): Respondent 8 with Assessment 2. Average = 2.0
8. V (Hypoglycemia): Respondent 17 with Assessment 3. Average = 3.0
9. I - MI: Respondent 16 with Assessment 3. Average = 3.0
10. II (Anaphylactic Shock): Respondent 6 with Assessment 2. Average = 2.0

Now, check which sessions have an average greater than 1.5. All the averages here are 2.0 or 3.0, which are all greater than 1.5. Therefore, all sessions meet the criteria. 

But wait, the problem says ""average 'Assessment' for that session name is greater than 1.5"". Since all sessions have averages of 2 or 3, which are all above 1.5, all respondents are part of such sessions. Therefore, the total count is the number of all respondents, which is 10. 

Wait, but looking back at the data, there are 10 respondents listed. Let me confirm:

Respondent IDs: 15,22,18,14,21,13,8,17,16,6. That's 10 respondents. 

But wait, the example given in the problem had an answer of 0. But in this case, all sessions have an average above 1.5. So the count would be 10. 

But wait, let me double-check each session's average. For example, session ""III - Sepsis"" has one respondent with Assessment 2. Average is 2.0. Similarly, ""IV (VT)"" has one respondent with 2.0. All others are either 2 or 3. So yes, all sessions have averages above 1.5. Therefore, all 10 respondents should be counted. 

But wait, the example in the problem had a different scenario where the answer was 0. But in this case, the answer would be 10. However, I need to make sure that I didn't miss any session with an average <=1.5. Let me check again:

Each session has only one respondent except perhaps some sessions that might have the same name. Wait, in the data, are there any sessions with the same name but different formatting? For example, ""III - Sepsis"" vs. ""III (Sepsis)"" – these are different session names as per the data. So each session has only one respondent, so each average is the same as the individual's score. 

But in the data, for example, ""III (Sepsis)"" (respondent 8) has Assessment 2. So average is 2.0. All sessions have averages of 2.0 or 3.0. Therefore, all sessions meet the average >1.5. Hence, all 10 respondents are counted. 

But wait, looking at the data again, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me list each session and their respondents:

- III - Sepsis: 1 respondent (15) → 2
- IV (VT): 1 (22) → 2
- IV - VT: 1 (18) →3
- IV-Hypoglycemia:1 (14) →3
- I (Myocardial infarction):1 (21) →2
- I-VF:1 (13) →2
- III (Sepsis):1 (8) →2
- V (Hypoglycemia):1 (17) →3
- I - MI:1 (16) →3
- II (Anaphylactic Shock):1 (6) →2

All of these have averages equal to their single respondent's score. All are 2 or 3, which are above 1.5. Therefore, all 10 respondents are part of sessions where the average is >1.5. 

So the answer should be 10. But wait, the example in the problem had a similar structure but the answer was 0. However, in that example, the date was 2025-05-02 and looking for score 1 in 'Background (examination)', and there were no respondents meeting that. 

But in this case, the answer is 10. However, I need to check again if I missed any sessions. Let me count the respondents again. The data has 10 respondents: 15,22,18,14,21,13,8,17,16,6. That's 10. All of them are in sessions with average >1.5. So the answer is 10.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the respondents whose 'Background (examination)' is higher than the average 'Background (examination)' for all sessions on the same date.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents whose 'Background (examination)' score is higher than the average 'Background (examination)' score for all sessions on the same date. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The XML has a list of respondents, each with answers to various questions, including the date of the session and the 'Background (examination)' score. 

The key steps are:
1. For each respondent, determine their 'Background (examination)' score.
2. For each date, calculate the average 'Background (examination)' score of all respondents on that date.
3. Compare each respondent's score to the average of their respective date.
4. Count how many respondents have a score higher than their date's average.

Let me start by extracting all the respondents and their dates and Background (examination) scores. 

Looking at the data:

Respondent 9: Date 2025-05-04, Background (examination) 2
Respondent 7: 2025-03-14, 3
Respondent 4: 2025-05-16, 2
Respondent 2: 2025-04-04, 3
Respondent 14: 2025-03-14, 2
Respondent 1: 2025-05-02, 2
Respondent 8: 2025-05-02, 2
Respondent 22: 2025-05-16, 3
Respondent 20: 2025-05-02, -1

Now, group them by date:

2025-03-14: Respondents 7 (3), 14 (2) → Average = (3+2)/2 = 2.5
2025-04-04: Respondent 2 (3) → Average = 3
2025-05-02: Respondents 1 (2), 8 (2), 20 (-1) → Average = (2 + 2 + (-1))/3 = 3/3 = 1
2025-05-04: Respondent 9 (2) → Average = 2
2025-05-16: Respondents 4 (2), 22 (3) → Average = (2+3)/2 = 2.5

Now, compare each respondent's score to their date's average:

- 2025-03-14:
  - Respondent 7: 3 > 2.5 → Yes
  - Respondent 14: 2 < 2.5 → No
- 2025-04-04:
  - Respondent 2: 3 = 3 → No (needs to be higher, not equal)
- 2025-05-02:
  - Respondent 1: 2 > 1 → Yes
  - Respondent 8: 2 > 1 → Yes
  - Respondent 20: -1 < 1 → No
- 2025-05-04:
  - Respondent 9: 2 = 2 → No
- 2025-05-16:
  - Respondent 4: 2 < 2.5 → No
  - Respondent 22: 3 > 2.5 → Yes

So the respondents with scores higher than their date's average are:
- Respondent 7 (2025-03-14)
- Respondent 1 (2025-05-02)
- Respondent 8 (2025-05-02)
- Respondent 22 (2025-05-16)

That's a total of 4 respondents. Let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss any:

- Respondent 7: 3 vs 2.5 → yes
- Respondent 1: 2 vs 1 → yes
- Respondent 8: 2 vs 1 → yes
- Respondent 22: 3 vs 2.5 → yes

Yes, that's four. So the answer should be 4.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the respondents who participated in a session where the average 'Assessment' for that session name is greater than 2.0.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents who participated in a session where the average 'Assessment' score for that session name is greater than 2.0. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The XML has a list of respondents, each with answers to various questions, including 'SessionName' and 'Assessment'. The 'Assessment' question uses a rubric from 0 to 3. 

The key steps here are:
1. Group all respondents by their 'SessionName'.
2. For each session, calculate the average 'Assessment' score.
3. Identify which sessions have an average greater than 2.0.
4. Count all respondents that are part of those sessions.

Let me start by extracting all the respondents and their 'SessionName' and 'Assessment' values. 

Looking at the data:

- Respondent 20: SessionName ""IV (VT)"", Assessment 3
- Respondent 2: SessionName ""MI"", Assessment 3
- Respondent 15: SessionName ""III - Sepsis"", Assessment 2
- Respondent 23: SessionName ""II-Anaphylaxsis"", Assessment 3
- Respondent 22: SessionName ""IV (VT)"", Assessment 2
- Respondent 8: SessionName ""III (Sepsis)"", Assessment 2
- Respondent 19: SessionName ""I - MI"", Assessment 2
- Respondent 13: SessionName ""I-VF"", Assessment 2

Now, group them by SessionName. Let's note that some session names might be similar but written differently, like ""III - Sepsis"" vs. ""III (Sepsis)"". Are these considered the same session? The problem states ""session name"", so I should treat them as different if the names are different. For example, ""III - Sepsis"" and ""III (Sepsis)"" are different session names. Similarly, ""MI"" and ""I - MI"" are different.

So, the sessions are:
1. IV (VT): Respondents 20 (Assessment 3) and 22 (Assessment 2). Average = (3 + 2)/2 = 2.5
2. MI: Respondent 2 (Assessment 3). Average = 3.0
3. III - Sepsis: Respondent 15 (Assessment 2). Average = 2.0
4. II-Anaphylaxsis: Respondent 23 (Assessment 3). Average = 3.0
5. III (Sepsis): Respondent 8 (Assessment 2). Average = 2.0
6. I - MI: Respondent 19 (Assessment 2). Average = 2.0
7. I-VF: Respondent 13 (Assessment 2). Average = 2.0

Now, check which sessions have an average greater than 2.0:
- IV (VT): 2.5 > 2.0 → yes
- MI: 3.0 > 2.0 → yes
- II-Anaphylaxsis: 3.0 > 2.0 → yes

The other sessions (III - Sepsis, III (Sepsis), I - MI, I-VF) have averages of exactly 2.0 or less, so they don't qualify.

Now, count the respondents in the qualifying sessions:
- IV (VT): 2 respondents (20 and 22)
- MI: 1 respondent (2)
- II-Anaphylaxsis: 1 respondent (23)

Total respondents = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4.

Wait, but let me double-check the session names and their respondents again to make sure I didn't miss any. 

Looking back:
- IV (VT) has respondents 20 and 22. Correct.
- MI has respondent 2. Correct.
- II-Anaphylaxsis has respondent 23. Correct.

So 2 + 1 + 1 = 4. Therefore, the answer should be 4.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score across all rubric items is below the average total score for all sessions.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the number of respondents whose total score across all rubric items is below the average total score for all sessions. 

First, I need to understand which questions are rubric-based and contribute to the total score. Looking at the questions section, the rubric items are:

- Identification (0-3)
- Situation (0-3)
- Background (history) (0-3)
- Background (examination) (0-3)
- Assessment (0-3)
- Recommendation (clear recommendation) (0-3)
- Recommendation (global rating scale) (0-3)

The other questions (Date, SessionName, Comments) are open-ended and don't contribute to the score. So, for each respondent, I need to sum the scores of these seven rubric questions.

Next, I'll go through each respondent in the responses section and calculate their total scores. Let's list them out:

Respondent 8:
- Identification: 3
- Situation: 3
- Background (history): 3
- Background (examination): 2
- Assessment: 2
- Recommendation (clear recommendation): 2
- GRS: 3
Total: 3+3+3+2+2+2+3 = 18

Respondent 18:
- Identification: 3
- Situation: 3
- Background (history): 2
- Background (examination): 2
- Assessment: 3
- Recommendation (clear recommendation): 2
- GRS: 2
Total: 3+3+2+2+3+2+2 = 17

Respondent 7:
- Identification: 3
- Situation: 3
- Background (history): 2
- Background (examination): 3
- Assessment: 2
- Recommendation (clear recommendation): 2
- GRS: 2
Total: 3+3+2+3+2+2+2 = 17

Respondent 2:
- Identification: 3
- Situation: 3
- Background (history): 2
- Background (examination): 3
- Assessment: 3
- Recommendation (clear recommendation): 2
- GRS: 1
Total: 3+3+2+3+3+2+1 = 17

Respondent 5:
- Identification: 3
- Situation: 3
- Background (history): 3
- Background (examination): 3
- Assessment: 3
- Recommendation (clear recommendation): 2
- GRS: 3
Total: 3+3+3+3+3+2+3 = 20

Respondent 17:
- Identification: 3
- Situation: 3
- Background (history): 3
- Background (examination): 3
- Assessment: 3
- Recommendation (clear recommendation): 3
- GRS: 2
Total: 3+3+3+3+3+3+2 = 20

Respondent 10:
- Identification: 2
- Situation: 2
- Background (history): 2
- Background (examination): 2
- Assessment: 2
- Recommendation (clear recommendation): 2
- GRS: 2
Total: 2+2+2+2+2+2+2 = 14

Respondent 23:
- Identification: 3
- Situation: 3
- Background (history): 2
- Background (examination): 2
- Assessment: 3
- Recommendation (clear recommendation): 3
- GRS: 3
Total: 3+3+2+2+3+3+3 = 19

Respondent 14:
- Identification: 3
- Situation: 3
- Background (history): 2
- Background (examination): 2
- Assessment: 3
- Recommendation (clear recommendation): 1
- GRS: 2
Total: 3+3+2+2+3+1+2 = 16

Respondent 12:
- Identification: 3
- Situation: 3
- Background (history): 3
- Background (examination): 3
- Assessment: 2
- Recommendation (clear recommendation): 3
- GRS: 3
Total: 3+3+3+3+2+3+3 = 20

Respondent 22:
- Identification: 3
- Situation: 3
- Background (history): 3
- Background (examination): 3
- Assessment: 2
- Recommendation (clear recommendation): 2
- GRS: 3
Total: 3+3+3+3+2+2+3 = 19

Now, let's list all the totals:
- 8: 18
- 18:17
- 7:17
- 2:17
- 5:20
- 17:20
- 10:14
- 23:19
- 14:16
- 12:20
- 22:19

Now, calculate the average total score. Sum all the totals and divide by the number of respondents (11).

Sum = 18 +17+17+17+20+20+14+19+16+20+19 = 
Let's compute step by step:
18+17=35
35+17=52
52+17=69
69+20=89
89+20=109
109+14=123
123+19=142
142+16=158
158+20=178
178+19=197

Total sum is 197. Average = 197 / 11 ≈ 17.909

So the average is approximately 17.91. Now, count how many respondents have a total score below this average. Since the average is ~17.91, scores below 17.91 are 17 and below.

Looking at the totals:
- 18:17 (17 < 17.91 → yes)
- 7:17 (yes)
- 2:17 (yes)
- 10:14 (yes)
- 14:16 (16 <17.91 → yes)
Others are 18, 19, 20 which are above or equal.

Wait, respondent 18's total is 17, which is below 17.91. Similarly, respondents 7, 2, 10, 14. Wait, let's check each:

Respondent 8: 18 → above average (18 >17.91)
Respondent 18:17 → below
Respondent7:17 → below
Respondent2:17 → below
Respondent5:20 → above
Respondent17:20 → above
Respondent10:14 → below
Respondent23:19 → above
Respondent14:16 → below
Respondent12:20 → above
Respondent22:19 → above

So the respondents with total below 17.91 are: 18,7,2,10,14. That's 5 respondents.

Wait, but let me recount:

Respondent IDs with totals below 17.91:

- 18 (17)
- 7 (17)
- 2 (17)
- 10 (14)
- 14 (16)

That's 5 respondents. So the answer should be 5. But wait, let me check again:

Wait, the respondents are:

ID 18:17

ID7:17

ID2:17

ID10:14

ID14:16

Total of 5. So the count is 5.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose 'Assessment' is higher than the average 'Assessment' for all sessions on the same date.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents whose 'Assessment' score is higher than the average 'Assessment' score for all sessions on the same date. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The XML data has a list of respondents, each with various answers, including the 'Date' and 'Assessment' scores. The 'Assessment' question is defined with a rubric from 0 to 3. 

So, the plan is:
1. For each respondent, note their 'Date' and 'Assessment' score.
2. For each date, calculate the average 'Assessment' score of all respondents on that date.
3. Compare each respondent's 'Assessment' score to the average of their respective date.
4. Count how many respondents have a score higher than their date's average.

Let me start by extracting all the respondents with their dates and assessment scores. Looking at the data:

- Respondent 19: Date 2025-05-16, Assessment 2
- Respondent 20: Date 2025-05-02, Assessment 3
- Respondent 11: Date 2025-04-04, Assessment 3
- Respondent 8: Date 2025-05-02, Assessment 2
- Respondent 10: Date 2025-03-14, Assessment 2
- Respondent 5: Date 2025-05-04, Assessment 3
- Respondent 17: Date 2025-05-04, Assessment 3
- Respondent 22: Date 2025-05-16, Assessment 2
- Respondent 7: Date 2025-03-14, Assessment 2
- Respondent 18: Date 2025-05-04, Assessment 3

Now, group them by date:

2025-03-14: Respondents 10 (2), 7 (2) → Average = (2+2)/2 = 2
2025-04-04: Respondent 11 (3) → Average = 3
2025-05-02: Respondents 20 (3), 8 (2) → Average = (3+2)/2 = 2.5
2025-05-04: Respondents 5 (3), 17 (3), 18 (3) → Average = (3+3+3)/3 = 3
2025-05-16: Respondents 19 (2), 22 (2) → Average = (2+2)/2 = 2

Next, compare each respondent's score to their date's average:

- 2025-03-14: Both have 2, which equals the average. So no one here.
- 2025-04-04: 3 vs average 3 → equal, so no.
- 2025-05-02: Respondent 20 (3 > 2.5 → yes), Respondent 8 (2 < 2.5 → no)
- 2025-05-04: All have 3, which equals the average of 3. So none.
- 2025-05-16: Both have 2, which equals the average. No.

So the only respondent with a score higher than the date's average is Respondent 20. Therefore, the count is 1.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the respondents whose 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' score is equal to the average 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' score for all sessions that occurred on the same date.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the number of respondents whose 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' score equals the average score of all sessions on the same date. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The XML has a list of respondents, each with answers to various questions, including the date of the session and the 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' score. 

The steps I need to follow are:

1. **Calculate the average 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' score for each date.**
   - For each unique date in the responses, compute the average of the 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' scores from all respondents on that date.

2. **For each respondent, check if their score matches the average score of their respective date.**
   - Compare each respondent's score to the precomputed average for their date.

3. **Count how many respondents meet this condition.**

Let's start by extracting all the dates and their corresponding scores. Looking at the data:

- **Respondent 2**: Date 2025-04-04, Score 2
- **Respondent 18**: 2025-05-04, 2
- **Respondent 19**: 2025-05-16, 3
- **Respondent 6**: 2025-04-04, 2
- **Respondent 14**: 2025-03-14, 1
- **Respondent 22**: 2025-05-16, 2
- **Respondent 16**: 2025-05-02, 2
- **Respondent 23**: 2025-03-14, 3
- **Respondent 20**: 2025-05-02, 2
- **Respondent 11**: 2025-04-04, 3

Now, group the scores by date:

- **2025-03-14**: Scores 1 (Respondent 14) and 3 (Respondent 23). Average = (1 + 3)/2 = 2
- **2025-04-04**: Scores 2 (Respondent 2), 2 (Respondent 6), 3 (Respondent 11). Average = (2 + 2 + 3)/3 ≈ 2.333. Since scores are integers, but the average is a float. However, the problem states ""equal to the average"", which might require checking if the average is an integer. If the average is not an integer, no one on that date would have a matching score. For 2025-04-04, the average is approximately 2.33, so no one's score (2,2,3) equals 2.33.
- **2025-05-02**: Scores 2 (Respondent 16) and 2 (Respondent 20). Average = (2 + 2)/2 = 2. So both have scores equal to the average.
- **2025-05-04**: Only Respondent 18 with score 2. Average is 2. So this respondent matches.
- **2025-05-16**: Scores 3 (Respondent 19) and 2 (Respondent 22). Average = (3 + 2)/2 = 2.5. No one has a score of 2.5, so no matches here.

Now, count the respondents whose score equals the average for their date:

- **2025-03-14**: Average is 2. Respondent 14 scored 1, Respondent 23 scored 3. Neither matches 2. So 0 here.
- **2025-04-04**: Average is ~2.33. No scores match. 0.
- **2025-05-02**: Both respondents (16 and 20) scored 2, which is the average. So 2 here.
- **2025-05-04**: Respondent 18 scored 2, which is the average. 1 here.
- **2025-05-16**: 0.

Adding them up: 0 + 0 + 2 + 1 + 0 = 3.

Wait, but let me double-check. For 2025-05-04, there's only one respondent (18) with score 2. The average is 2, so that's a match. For 2025-05-02, two respondents (16 and 20) with score 2, average 2. So total of 3 respondents. 

Therefore, the answer should be 3.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose 'Background (examination)' is higher than the average 'Background (examination)' for all sessions on the same date.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents whose 'Background (examination)' score is higher than the average 'Background (examination)' score for all sessions on the same date. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The XML data has a list of respondents, each with answers to various questions, including the date of the session and the 'Background (examination)' score. 

So, the plan is:
1. For each respondent, note their date and their 'Background (examination)' score.
2. For each date, calculate the average of all 'Background (examination)' scores from respondents on that date.
3. Compare each respondent's score to the average of their respective date.
4. Count how many respondents have a score higher than their date's average.

Let me start by extracting all the respondents' dates and their corresponding 'Background (examination)' scores. 

Looking at the data:
- Respondent 17: Date 2025-05-04, score 3
- Respondent 11: 2025-04-04, 3
- Respondent 14: 2025-03-14, 2
- Respondent 21: 2025-05-16, 1
- Respondent 5: 2025-05-04, 3
- Respondent 10: 2025-03-14, 2
- Respondent 13: 2025-03-14, 1
- Respondent 6: 2025-04-04, 3
- Respondent 23: 2025-03-14, 2
- Respondent 9: 2025-05-04, 2
- Respondent 8: 2025-05-02, 2

Now, group them by date:

2025-05-04: Respondents 17, 5, 9. Scores: 3, 3, 2. Average = (3+3+2)/3 = 8/3 ≈ 2.67
2025-04-04: Respondents 11, 6. Scores: 3, 3. Average = 3
2025-03-14: Respondents 14,10,13,23. Scores: 2,2,1,2. Average = (2+2+1+2)/4 = 7/4 = 1.75
2025-05-16: Respondent 21. Score 1. Average = 1
2025-05-02: Respondent 8. Score 2. Average = 2

Now, compare each respondent's score to their date's average:

2025-05-04:
- 17: 3 > 2.67 → yes
- 5: 3 > 2.67 → yes
- 9: 2 < 2.67 → no

2025-04-04:
- 11: 3 = 3 → no
- 6: 3 = 3 → no

2025-03-14:
- 14: 2 > 1.75 → yes
- 10: 2 > 1.75 → yes
- 13: 1 < 1.75 → no
- 23: 2 > 1.75 → yes

2025-05-16:
- 21: 1 = 1 → no

2025-05-02:
- 8: 2 = 2 → no

Now, count the 'yes' cases. From 2025-05-04: 2 respondents (17,5). From 2025-03-14: 3 respondents (14,10,23). Total is 2 + 3 = 5.

Wait, let me check again. For 2025-03-14, the scores are 2,2,1,2. The average is 1.75. So respondents 14 (2), 10 (2), and 23 (2) all have scores higher than 1.75. Respondent 13 has 1, which is below. So that's 3 respondents here. Then 2025-05-04 has 2. So total 5. 

But wait, the answer in the example was 0 for a similar question. But in this case, the task is different. The example was counting respondents on 2025-05-02 with score 1, which had 0. But here, the task is more complex. 

So the final count should be 5. Let me verify each step again to be sure.

Yes, the calculation seems correct. The total is 5 respondents.

5",True
