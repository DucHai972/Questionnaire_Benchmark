</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who participated in a 'II-Anaphylaxsis' session.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task. The question is asking to count the respondents who participated in a 'II-Anaphylaxsis' session. 

First, I need to look at the data provided in the responses section. Each respondent has a 'SessionName' field. The task is to find all respondents where the SessionName exactly matches 'II-Anaphylaxsis'. 

Looking through each respondent:

- Respondent 1: SessionName is ""V (Hypoglycemia)"" – not a match.
- Respondent 3: ""III-Sepsis"" – nope.
- Respondent 13: ""I-VF"" – no.
- Respondent 17: ""V (Hypoglycemia)"" – not matching.
- Respondent 15: ""III - Sepsis"" – different.
- Respondent 8: ""III (Sepsis)"" – no.
- Respondent 7: ""III-Sepsis"" – still not.
- Respondent 12: ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" – close but the spelling is Anaphylaxis, not Anaphylaxsis.
- Respondent 23: ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" – this matches exactly. So that's one.
- Respondent 19: ""I - MI"" – no.
- Respondent 5: ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" – the SessionName here is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"". The hyphens and spaces might differ, but the key part is ""Anaphylaxsis"". The session name in the task is 'II-Anaphylaxsis', so the prefix here is ""II - "" with a space and hyphen. The task's session name is written as 'II-Anaphylaxsis' without the space. But in data analysis, sometimes variations in formatting like spaces or hyphens might be considered the same. Wait, but the task specifies 'II-Anaphylaxsis' exactly. Let me check the exact entries.

Looking at Respondent 23's SessionName: ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" (no space after II). Respondent 5's SessionName is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" (with space and hyphen). The task is to match 'II-Anaphylaxsis', so Respondent 5's entry has a space after II, making it ""II - Anaphylaxsis"". Are these considered the same? The task's exact wording is 'II-Anaphylaxsis', so unless the data entry is case-sensitive or exact, Respondent 5's session name is slightly different. However, the core part is ""Anaphylaxsis"" which is the same. But the session name in the task is written as 'II-Anaphylaxsis', which in the data, Respondent 23 has exactly that. Respondent 5's is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" with a space and hyphen. So maybe they are different sessions. For example, ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" vs. ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" could be considered different if the hyphen spacing matters. But maybe the user considers them the same. Wait, looking back at the example given in the initial data, the answer was 0. Let me check the example. In the example, the task was to count respondents from '2025-05-02' with score 1 on Background (examination). The answer was 0. Looking at the data, Respondent 13 had a score of 1 on Background (examination) but their date was 2025-03-14, so not counted. So the example shows that exact matching is required. Therefore, in this case, the SessionName must exactly match 'II-Anaphylaxsis' as written. 

So Respondent 23's SessionName is ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" which matches exactly. Respondent 5's is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" with a space and hyphen, which is different. Therefore, only Respondent 23 matches. But wait, let me check again. The task says 'II-Anaphylaxsis' – in the data, Respondent 23's SessionName is ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" (exact match). Respondent 5's is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" (with space and hyphen). So only Respondent 23. But wait, another respondent: Respondent 12 has ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" which is a different spelling (Anaphylaxis vs. Anaphylaxsis). So that's a different session. 

Therefore, the count is 1. But wait, let me check all respondents again to be sure. 

Looking through all the responses again:

- Respondent 23: SessionName: II-Anaphylaxsis – matches.
- Respondent 5: SessionName: II - Anaphylaxsis – the session name has a space after II and before the hyphen. So ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" vs. ""II-Anaphylaxsis"". Depending on the system, these might be considered different. Since the task specifies 'II-Anaphylaxsis' without the space, Respondent 5's entry is different. So only Respondent 23. 

But wait, in the data, Respondent 5's SessionName is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"". The task is to count 'II-Anaphylaxsis'. The hyphen and spacing might be a typo, but according to exact string matching, they are different. Therefore, only Respondent 23. 

So the answer should be 1.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who participated in a 'II - Anaphylaxsis' session.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task. I need to count the respondents who participated in a session named 'II - Anaphylaxsis'. 

First, I'll look at the data provided. The key here is to check each respondent's SessionName and see if it matches exactly 'II - Anaphylaxsis'. But wait, I should also consider possible variations in the SessionName entries. For example, sometimes there might be parentheses or different spacing.

Looking at the responses:

- Respondent 23: SessionName is 'II-Anaphylaxsis'. The hyphen instead of a space and dash. Close but not exactly the same as 'II - Anaphylaxsis'.
- Respondent 5: SessionName is 'II - Anaphylaxsis'. That's an exact match.
- Respondent 12: SessionName is 'II (Anaphylaxis)'. The spelling here is Anaphylaxis instead of Anaphylaxsis. The extra 's' might be a typo, but according to the data, we have to take it as is. So this is a different name.
- Other respondents have different SessionNames like 'I - MI', 'V (Hypoglycemia)', etc.

So, only Respondent 5 has the exact SessionName 'II - Anaphylaxsis'. Wait, but Respondent 23's SessionName is 'II-Anaphylaxsis' (with a hyphen instead of space-dash). Should I consider that a match? The task specifies 'II - Anaphylaxsis' with a space and dash. The data entries might have inconsistencies, but according to the instructions, I should match exactly as per the data. Since the task is looking for the exact name 'II - Anaphylaxsis', only Respondent 5 matches. Respondent 23's SessionName is written without the space, so it's a different entry. Therefore, the count is 1.

- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the respondents who scored 3 on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task. The question is asking to count the respondents who scored 3 on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)'. 

First, I need to make sure I understand the data structure. The 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' is question 8 in the survey. The rubric for this question is:
0 = No recommendation,
1 = Clear recommendation only after extended questioning,
2 = Clear recommendation after minimal questioning,
3 = Clear comprehensive recommendation without questioning.

So, I need to look through each respondent's entry for the 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' field and check if their score is 3.

Looking at the responses:

Respondent 8: Recommendation (clear recommendation): 2 → Not 3.
Respondent 2: 2 → No.
Respondent 17: 3 → Yes.
Respondent 23: 3 → Yes.
Respondent 20: 2 → No.
Respondent 22: 2 → No.
Respondent 4: 2 → No.
Respondent 14: 1 → No.

Wait, let me go through each one again to be sure.

Respondent 8: 2 → No.
Respondent 2: 2 → No.
Respondent 17: 3 → Count this one.
Respondent 23: 3 → Count this one.
Respondent 20: 2 → No.
Respondent 22: 2 → No.
Respondent 4: 2 → No.
Respondent 14: 1 → No.

So, only respondents 17 and 23 have a score of 3. That's two respondents. Therefore, the answer should be 2.

<task>
Count the respondents from the 'II (Anaphylactic Shock)' session who scored 1 on 'Background (history)' and 2 on 'Situation'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents from the 'II (Anaphylactic Shock)' session who scored 1 on 'Background (history)' and 2 on 'Situation'. 

First, I need to go through each respondent in the data and check if they meet all three conditions: their SessionName is 'II (Anaphylactic Shock)', their Background (history) score is 1, and their Situation score is 2.

Looking at the responses:

Starting with Respondent 23: Their SessionName is 'II-Anaphylaxsis', which is similar but not exactly 'II (Anaphylactic Shock)'. So they don't qualify.

Respondent 16: SessionName is 'I - MI', so no.

Respondent 4: SessionName is 'III (Sepsis)', nope.

Respondent 5: 'II - Anaphylaxsis' – again, similar but not the exact name. The session name needs to match exactly, right? The task specifies 'II (Anaphylactic Shock)', so variations in spelling or formatting might matter. So this one is out.

Respondent 1: SessionName is 'V (Hypoglycemia)', so no.

Respondent 18: 'IV - VT', not matching.

Respondent 6: Here's a match. Their SessionName is 'II (Anaphylactic Shock)'. Now check the scores. Background (history) is 3, and Situation is 2. But we need Background (history) to be 1, so this doesn't fit.

Respondent 14: SessionName is 'IV-Hypoglycemia', so no.

Respondent 11: 'IV (AF)', nope.

Respondent 8: 'III (Sepsis)', not matching.

Wait, did I miss any other respondents? Let me check again. The data includes Respondents 23, 16, 4, 5, 1, 18, 6, 14, 11, 8. 

Looking at Respondent 6 again: SessionName is correct, but Background (history) is 3, which is higher than required. So no one else in the list has the exact SessionName 'II (Anaphylactic Shock)'. 

Therefore, there are zero respondents that meet all three criteria. The answer should be 0.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who scored 0 on 'Background (history)' and whose 'Comments' contain the word 'Clear'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The goal is to count the respondents who scored 0 on 'Background (history)' and have the word 'Clear' in their Comments.

First, I need to look at the 'Background (history)' question. From the questions section, the rubric for question 5 (Background history) is:
0 = History is unstructured or non-relevant
1 = Relevant history but frequent clarification needed
2 = Relevant history with few further questions needed
3 = Comprehensive focused history

So, I need to find all respondents where Background (history) is 0.

Next, check their Comments field for the presence of the word 'Clear' (case-insensitive, I assume). The task says ""contain the word 'Clear'"", so any comment that includes 'clear' in any case (like 'Clear', 'clear', 'CLEAR') should be considered. But looking at the data, the comments seem to have 'Clear' capitalized when used, like ""Clear communication"" or ""Diagnostic clarity is present"". Wait, 'clarity' isn't 'clear', but maybe 'Clear' as a standalone word. So I need to check each comment for the exact substring 'Clear' (case-sensitive? The output rules don't specify, but the example in the data has ""Clear communication"", so maybe case-sensitive. But the task says ""contain the word 'Clear'"", so perhaps exact match. Let's proceed with case-sensitive check for 'Clear'.

Now, go through each respondent in the data:

Respondent 21: Background (history) is 3. Comments mention 'Diagnostic clarity' and 'Good...' – no 'Clear', so skip.

Respondent 7: Background (history) is 2. Comments: ""Time: ..."" – no. Skip.

Respondent 10: Background (history) 2. Comments: Time. Skip.

Respondent 11: Background (history) 3. Comments: ""Clear communication..."" but score is 3. So even though 'Clear' is there, the history score is 3. Doesn't meet criteria.

Respondent 23: Background (history) 2. Comments mention 'Talking to registrav...' and 'DID: Sepsis...' – no 'Clear'. Skip.

Respondent 2: Background (history) 2. Comments empty. Skip.

Respondent 3: Background (history) 3. Comments: ""Clear communication..."" but score is 3. So no.

Respondent 8: Background (history) 3. Comments: ""Clear communication..."" but history is 3. Doesn't qualify.

Respondent 9: Background (history) 2. Comments: ""Overall a bit unclear..."" – 'unclear' is not 'Clear'. Skip.

Respondent 12: Background (history) 3. Comments: ""Good"" – no. Skip.

Respondent 14: Background (history) 2. Comments: ""Late response..."" – no. Skip.

Respondent 1: Background (history) 2. Comments: ""Satisfactory"" – no.

Wait, none of the respondents have a Background (history) score of 0. Let me check again.

Looking through all respondents:

- Respondent 3: Identification is 0, but Background (history) is 3.
- Respondent 1: Identification is -1, but Background (history) is 2.

All other respondents have Background (history) scores of 2 or 3. So there are zero respondents with a score of 0 on Background (history). Therefore, even if their comments had 'Clear', the count would be zero. But let's confirm.

Wait, the task is to count those who scored 0 on Background (history) AND have 'Clear' in comments. Since no one has a 0 in Background (history), the answer is 0.

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 'Background (history)' is greater than 5.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents whose total score for 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 'Background (history)' is greater than 5. 

First, I need to make sure I understand the data structure. The questions section defines each field. 'Background (history)' is question 5 with a rubric from 0 to 3. 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is question 9, also with a rubric from 0 to 3. The total of these two would range from 0+0=0 to 3+3=6. The question asks for a total greater than 5, so the sum needs to be 6.

Now, I'll go through each respondent and check their scores for these two fields. Let's list them out:

Respondent 14:
- Background (history): 2
- Recommendation (global rating scale): 2
Sum: 2 + 2 = 4 → Not greater than 5.

Respondent 6:
- Background (history): 3
- Recommendation (global rating scale): 3
Sum: 3 + 3 = 6 → Meets the condition.

Respondent 2:
- Background (history): 2
- Recommendation (global rating scale): 1
Sum: 2 + 1 = 3 → No.

Respondent 13:
- Background (history): 2
- Recommendation (global rating scale): 2
Sum: 4 → No.

Respondent 16:
- Background (history): 3
- Recommendation (global rating scale): 3
Sum: 6 → Yes.

Respondent 22:
- Background (history): 3
- Recommendation (global rating scale): 3
Sum: 6 → Yes.

Respondent 10:
- Background (history): 2
- Recommendation (global rating scale): 2
Sum: 4 → No.

So, the respondents who meet the criteria are 6, 16, and 22. That's three respondents. Let me double-check each entry to ensure I didn't make a mistake. All three have 3 in both fields, summing to 6, which is greater than 5. The others have sums of 4 or less. Therefore, the count should be 3.

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Background (history)' and 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is greater than 3.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents whose total score for 'Background (history)' and 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is greater than 3. 

First, I need to make sure I understand the data structure. The questions section defines each field. 'Background (history)' is question 5, and its rubric ranges from 0 to 3. Similarly, 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is question 9, also with a rubric from 0 to 3. 

Now, looking at the responses, I need to go through each respondent and calculate the sum of these two scores. If the sum is greater than 3, I should count that respondent.

Let's start with Respondent 1. Their Background (history) score is 2, and the Recommendation (global rating scale) is 2. Adding those gives 4, which is greater than 3. So that's one.

Next, Respondent 10. Background (history) is 2, and the global rating is 2. Again, 2+2=4. That's another one. Wait, but the task says ""greater than 3"", so 4 is acceptable. So that's two so far.

Respondent 19: Background (history) is 3, global rating is 3. 3+3=6, which is definitely greater than 3. That's the third.

Respondent 20: Background (history) is 2, global rating is 3. 2+3=5. That's the fourth.

Respondent 4: Background (history) is 3, global rating is 2. 3+2=5. That's the fifth.

Wait, but wait. Let me check each respondent again to make sure I didn't miss any. Let's list them all:

Respondent 1: 2 + 2 = 4 → yes.
Respondent 10: 2 + 2 = 4 → yes.
Respondent 19: 3 + 3 = 6 → yes.
Respondent 20: 2 + 3 = 5 → yes.
Respondent 4: 3 + 2 = 5 → yes.

Wait, but looking back at the data provided, the respondents listed are 1, 10, 19, 20, and 4. Are there more respondents? The data in the questionnaire shows only these five. So all five respondents have a sum of 4, 4, 6, 5, and 5 respectively. All of these are greater than 3. But wait, the example given in the initial data had an answer of 0, but that was for a different question. The current task is different.

Wait, but let me check again. The task is to count the respondents where the sum of 'Background (history)' and 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is greater than 3. 

Looking at each respondent:

Respondent 1: Background (history) = 2, GRS = 2 → 4 → yes.
Respondent 10: 2 + 2 = 4 → yes.
Respondent 19: 3 + 3 = 6 → yes.
Respondent 20: 2 + 3 = 5 → yes.
Respondent 4: 3 + 2 = 5 → yes.

So all five respondents meet the criteria. But wait, the data provided in the questionnaire has only these five respondents. So the answer would be 5. But wait, let me check again. Wait, the example in the initial data had an answer of 0, but that was for a different question (counting those with score 1 on a different field on a specific date). So in this case, all five respondents have a sum greater than 3. But wait, let me check each one again to be sure.

Wait, Respondent 20's Background (examination) is -1, but that's a different field. The task is about Background (history) and Recommendation (global rating scale). So for Respondent 20, Background (history) is 2, GRS is 3. 2+3=5. Correct.

Respondent 4: Background (history) is 3, GRS is 2. 3+2=5. Correct.

So all five respondents have sums of 4,4,6,5,5. All are greater than 3. Therefore, the count is 5. But wait, the data in the questionnaire shows only these five respondents. So the answer should be 5. But let me check again to make sure I didn't miscount.

Wait, the data in the questionnaire's responses section lists:

Respondent 1, 10, 19, 20, 4. That's five respondents. Each of them has a sum of Background (history) and GRS greater than 3. So the answer is 5. But wait, let me check each one again:

Respondent 1: 2 (history) + 2 (GRS) = 4 >3 → yes.
Respondent 10: 2 +2=4 → yes.
Respondent 19:3+3=6 → yes.
Respondent 20:2+3=5 → yes.
Respondent 4:3+2=5 → yes.

Yes, all five. So the answer is 5. But wait, the example in the initial data had an answer of 0, but that's a different question. So in this case, the correct answer is 5.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who scored 2 on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and whose 'Comments' contain the word 'communication'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The goal is to count the respondents who scored 2 on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and have the word 'communication' in their Comments.

First, I need to look at the 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' field for each respondent. The rubric for this question is: 0 = Not at all confident, 1 = Confident but required extended questioning, 2 = Confident but required some further questioning, 3 = Confident and required little or no questioning. So, we're looking for respondents with a score of 2 here.

Next, I need to check their 'Comments' section to see if it contains the word 'communication'. The search should be case-insensitive, but I should look for any form of the word, like 'communication', 'communications', etc. But in the data provided, I need to check each comment exactly as written.

Now, let's go through each respondent one by one.

Starting with Respondent 10:
- Recommendation (global rating scale): 2
- Comments: ""Time: (15:53-16:14)"" – no mention of communication. So, doesn't qualify.

Respondent 15:
- Score: 2
- Comments: ""Detailed Response - clear communication"" – here, 'communication' is present. So this counts.

Respondent 21:
- Score: 3 (needs to be 2, so skip)

Respondent 18:
- Score: 2
- Comments: ""Not very concise or clear communication"" – 'communication' is there. So this counts.

Respondent 17:
- Score: 2
- Comments: ""Concise - clear"" – no 'communication' here. So no.

Respondent 16:
- Score: 3 – skip.

Respondent 5:
- Score: 3 – skip.

Respondent 22:
- Score: 3 – skip.

Respondent 19:
- Score: 3 – skip.

Respondent 4:
- Score: 2
- Comments: ""Clinical handover and communication skills, satisfactory"" – 'communication' is present. So this counts.

Wait, let me check again. Respondent 4's global rating is 2, and comments include 'communication'. So that's another one.

So, the respondents meeting both criteria are 15, 18, and 4. Wait, let me verify each again.

Respondent 15: Score 2, comments have 'communication' – yes.

Respondent 18: Score 2, comments: ""Not very concise or clear communication"" – yes.

Respondent 4: Score 2, comments: ""Clinical handover and communication skills..."" – yes.

So that's three respondents. Wait, but let me check all again to make sure I didn't miss any.

Looking back:

Respondent 10: Score 2, but no 'communication' in comments.

Respondent 15: Yes.

Respondent 18: Yes.

Respondent 4: Yes.

Any others? Let's check all the other respondents with score 2.

Respondent 10: No.

Respondent 18: Yes.

Respondent 17: Score 2, but comments are ""Concise - clear"" – no 'communication'.

Respondent 4: Yes.

So total of three respondents: 15, 18, 4. Wait, but let me check the data again.

Wait, the data for Respondent 4:

Date: 2025-05-16

Recommendation (global rating scale): 2

Comments: ""Clinical handover and communication skills, satisfactory

No panic, no arrest team

Satisfactory""

Yes, 'communication' is there.

So that's three respondents. But wait, let me check the original data again to confirm.

Looking at the responses:

Respondent 15: Comments: ""Detailed Response - clear communication"" – yes.

Respondent 18: Comments: ""Not very concise or clear communication"" – yes.

Respondent 4: Comments: ""Clinical handover and communication skills, satisfactory"" – yes.

So three respondents. Therefore, the answer should be 3.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Identification' and 'Assessment' is greater than 6.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents whose total score for 'Identification' and 'Assessment' is greater than 6. 

First, I need to make sure I understand the data structure. The questions section defines each field, and the responses have the actual data. The relevant fields here are 'Identification' and 'Assessment'. Both are rubric-based scores ranging from 0 to 3. 

So, for each respondent, I need to add their 'Identification' score and 'Assessment' score. If the sum is greater than 6, they should be counted.

Let me go through each respondent one by one:

**Respondent 11:**
- Identification: 3
- Assessment: 3
- Total: 3 + 3 = 6 → Not greater than 6. Exclude.

**Respondent 6:**
- Identification: 3
- Assessment: 2
- Total: 3 + 2 = 5 → Exclude.

**Respondent 15:**
- Identification: 3
- Assessment: 2
- Total: 5 → Exclude.

**Respondent 9:**
- Identification: 3
- Assessment: 2
- Total: 5 → Exclude.

**Respondent 22:**
- Identification: 3
- Assessment: 2
- Total: 5 → Exclude.

**Respondent 1:**
- Identification: -1 (Wait, the rubric for Identification goes from 0 to 3. But here it's -1. That's odd. Maybe a data entry error? But according to the data, it's -1. So, even if we take it as is, -1 + 3 (Assessment) = 2. Exclude.)

**Respondent 23:**
- Identification: 3
- Assessment: 3
- Total: 6 → Exclude.

**Respondent 10:**
- Identification: 2
- Assessment: 2
- Total: 4 → Exclude.

Hmm, none of the respondents have a total greater than 6. The highest possible sum is 3 + 3 = 6, which is exactly 6, not greater. So the count should be 0.

Wait, but let me double-check. Are there any other respondents I might have missed? Let me count again:

Looking at all respondents:

- 11: 3+3=6 → no
- 6: 3+2=5 → no
- 15:3+2=5 → no
- 9:3+2=5 → no
- 22:3+2=5 → no
- 1: -1+3=2 → no
- 23:3+3=6 → no
- 10:2+2=4 → no

No one has a total over 6. So the answer is 0.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents from the 'V (Hypoglycemia)' session who scored 0 on 'Identification' and 1 on 'Assessment'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The goal is to count the respondents from the 'V (Hypoglycemia)' session who scored 0 on 'Identification' and 1 on 'Assessment'. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The questions section defines each field, and the responses are from various respondents. 

Starting with the session name: the task specifies 'V (Hypoglycemia)'. I need to check each respondent's SessionName to see if it matches exactly. Let's look through the responses:

- Respondent 17 has SessionName: V (Hypoglycemia)
- Respondent 14: IV-Hypoglycemia (different session)
- Others have different session names like IV (VT), III-Sepsis, etc. So only Respondent 17 is in the correct session.

Next, check the scores for Identification and Assessment. The task requires Identification to be 0 and Assessment to be 1. 

Looking at Respondent 17's data:
- Identification: 3
- Assessment: 3

So, this respondent doesn't meet the criteria. 

Wait, maybe I missed other respondents. Let me check all again. 

Looking through each respondent's SessionName:

- Respondent 17: V (Hypoglycemia) – correct session. 
- Others: No other respondents have 'V (Hypoglycemia)' as their SessionName. 

Now, check their Identification and Assessment scores. Respondent 17's Identification is 3 (which is not 0) and Assessment is 3 (not 1). Therefore, there are no respondents in the 'V (Hypoglycemia)' session with Identification 0 and Assessment 1. 

So the count should be 0.

</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents from the 'IV (AF)' session who scored 0 on 'Background (examination)' and 2 on 'Identification'. 

First, I need to go through each respondent in the data and check if they meet all three conditions: their SessionName is 'IV (AF)', their Background (examination) score is 0, and their Identification score is 2.

Looking at the responses:

Starting with Respondent 5: Their SessionName is 'II - Anaphylaxsis', so that's not IV (AF). Skip.

Respondent 16: SessionName is 'I - MI'. Not relevant.

Respondent 11: SessionName is 'IV (AF)'. Okay, that's a match. Now check their Background (examination) score. It's 3. So that's not 0. So they don't qualify. Next.

Respondent 8: SessionName is 'III (Sepsis)'. Not IV (AF). Skip.

Respondent 1: SessionName is 'V (Hypoglycemia)'. No.

Respondent 9: SessionName is 'II (Anaphylaxsis)'. Not matching.

Respondent 13: SessionName is 'I-VF'. Not IV (AF).

Respondent 20: SessionName is 'IV (VT)'. Close, but VT instead of AF. So no.

Respondent 22: SessionName is 'IV (VT)'. Again, VT. Not AF.

Now, are there any other respondents in the data? Let me check again. The list provided includes Respondents 5, 16, 11, 8, 1, 9, 13, 20, 22. That's all. 

So among these, only Respondent 11 has SessionName 'IV (AF)'. But their Background (examination) is 3, not 0. Also, their Identification is 3, not 2. So they don't meet the criteria. 

Are there any other respondents in the data that I might have missed? Let me check again. The data provided doesn't have any other respondents with SessionName 'IV (AF)'. 

Therefore, there are zero respondents who meet all three conditions. The answer should be 0.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents from the 'II-Anaphylaxsis' session who scored 0 on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 2 on 'Situation'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The question is asking to count the respondents from the 'II-Anaphylaxsis' session who scored 0 on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 2 on 'Situation'. 

First, I need to look through all the respondents in the data provided. Let me go through each respondent one by one.

Starting with Respondent 11: Their SessionName is 'IV (AF)', which doesn't match 'II-Anaphylaxsis'. So they're out.

Respondent 10: SessionName is '(MI)-VT'. Not matching. Next.

Respondent 19: SessionName is 'I - MI'. Nope.

Respondent 21: SessionName is 'I (Myocardial infarction)'. Doesn't match.

Respondent 1: SessionName is 'V (Hypoglycemia)'. Not relevant.

Respondent 9: SessionName is 'II (Anaphylaxsis)'. Wait, the task is looking for 'II-Anaphylaxsis'. The hyphen vs. parentheses might be a variation. Let me check the exact spelling. The task specifies 'II-Anaphylaxsis', so I need to see if any respondents have that exact SessionName. 

Looking at Respondent 9: The SessionName is written as 'II (Anaphylaxsis)' with parentheses. Then Respondent 23 has 'II-Anaphylaxsis' with a hyphen. So the exact match for 'II-Anaphylaxsis' is Respondent 23. But wait, the task says 'II-Anaphylaxsis', so Respondent 23's SessionName is exactly that. However, let's check others.

Respondent 12: SessionName is 'II (Anaphylaxis)'. Note the spelling difference here: Anaphylaxis vs. Anaphylaxsis. The task has 'Anaphylaxsis', which is a possible misspelling of Anaphylaxis. But according to the data, Respondent 9 and 23 have 'Anaphylaxsis' in their SessionNames. So maybe it's a typo, but we have to take it as given. So only respondents with SessionName exactly 'II-Anaphylaxsis' (with hyphen and spelling) are considered. 

Looking at the data:

- Respondent 9: SessionName is 'II (Anaphylaxsis)' — parentheses, not hyphen. So not exact match.
- Respondent 23: SessionName is 'II-Anaphylaxsis' — hyphen and correct spelling as per task. So this is a match.

Now, for these respondents, check their scores on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 'Situation'.

Starting with Respondent 23:
- Situation: 3 (from the data: Situation: 3)
- Recommendation (global rating scale): 3
So they scored 3 on both, which doesn't meet the criteria of 0 on GRS and 2 on Situation. So they don't count.

Next, check other respondents with SessionName variations. Wait, maybe the task is considering any session that is 'II-Anaphylaxsis' regardless of formatting. Let me check all respondents again.

Looking for SessionName that includes 'II' and 'Anaphylaxsis' in any format. Let's see:

Respondent 9: 'II (Anaphylaxsis)' — this is SessionName. So even though it's in parentheses, the session is II and Anaphylaxsis. The task's SessionName is 'II-Anaphylaxsis', but maybe the hyphen vs. parentheses is a formatting difference. However, in data analysis, exact string matching is usually required unless specified otherwise. So unless the task allows for variations, we have to match exactly. But let's check the data again.

Wait, in the example provided earlier, the answer was 0. The example had a similar structure. Let me see if there's a pattern. The example asked for '2025-05-02' and 'Background (examination)' score 1. The answer was 0 because none of the respondents on that date had a score of 1. So in that case, the analysis was strict.

So applying the same logic here, the SessionName must exactly match 'II-Anaphylaxsis' as written. So only Respondent 23 has that exact SessionName. Now, check their scores:

- Situation: 3 (needs to be 2)
- Recommendation (global rating scale): 3 (needs to be 0)

So they don't meet the criteria. Are there any other respondents with SessionName 'II-Anaphylaxsis'? Let's check all:

Looking through the list again:

Respondent 9: SessionName is 'II (Anaphylaxsis)' — parentheses, not hyphen. So not exact.

Respondent 12: 'II (Anaphylaxis)' — different spelling (Anaphylaxis vs. Anaphylaxsis). So not a match.

Respondent 23: 'II-Anaphylaxsis' — exact match. But their scores are 3 and 3.

No other respondents have SessionName exactly 'II-Anaphylaxsis'. Therefore, there are zero respondents who meet both criteria. So the answer is 0.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents from the 'IV (VT)' session who scored 1 on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 0 on 'Background (examination)'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents from the 'IV (VT)' session who scored 1 on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 0 on 'Background (examination)'. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The questions section defines each field, and the responses are from various respondents. Let me start by identifying the relevant fields and their criteria.

The key fields here are:
- SessionName: We need to filter respondents where SessionName is exactly 'IV (VT)'.
- Background (examination): We need a score of 0.
- Recommendation (global rating scale): We need a score of 1.

Now, I'll go through each respondent in the data and check these three conditions.

Looking at the responses:

Respondent 15: SessionName is 'III - Sepsis'. Doesn't match. Skip.

Respondent 10: SessionName is '(MI)-VT'. Not 'IV (VT)'. Skip.

Respondent 6: SessionName is 'II (Anaphylactic Shock)'. No.

Respondent 13: SessionName is 'I-VF'. Not matching.

Respondent 17: SessionName is 'V (Hypoglycemia)'. Nope.

Respondent 22: SessionName is 'IV (VT)'. Let's check the scores. Background (examination) is 3, which is not 0. So even though the session matches, the scores don't. Disregard.

Respondent 4: SessionName is 'III (Sepsis)'. Not relevant.

Respondent 18: SessionName is 'IV - VT'. Wait, the task specifies 'IV (VT)'. The respondent's SessionName is written as 'IV - VT'. The parentheses and hyphen might be different. But the task is looking for exact matches. The problem is whether 'IV - VT' is considered the same as 'IV (VT)'. The original example in the data has 'IV (VT)' for Respondent 22 and 'IV - VT' for Respondent 18. The task is asking for 'IV (VT)', so I need to check if the SessionName matches exactly. Since 'IV - VT' uses a hyphen and space instead of parentheses, it's a different string. Therefore, Respondent 18's session doesn't match. 

Now, checking the scores for the only possible candidate, Respondent 22. But their Background (examination) is 3, and Recommendation (global rating scale) is 3. So they don't meet the criteria. 

Wait, are there any other respondents with SessionName 'IV (VT)'? Let me check again. Respondent 22: SessionName is 'IV (VT)'. Background (examination) is 3. Recommendation (global rating scale) is 3. So no. 

Are there any other respondents with SessionName that might be a variation? For example, maybe 'IV-VT' without parentheses? Let me check all SessionNames again:

Respondent 10: (MI)-VT
Respondent 6: II (Anaphylactic Shock)
Respondent 13: I-VF
Respondent 17: V (Hypoglycemia)
Respondent 22: IV (VT)
Respondent 4: III (Sepsis)
Respondent 18: IV - VT

No other 'IV (VT)' sessions. So the only one is Respondent 22, but their scores don't match. 

Therefore, there are zero respondents meeting all three conditions.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Assessment' and 'Identification' is greater than 6.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task. The goal is to count the respondents whose total score for 'Assessment' and 'Identification' is greater than 6. 

First, I need to understand where these two fields are in the data. Looking at the questions section:

3. Identification: ... [Rubric: 0-3]
7. Assessment: ... [Rubric: 0-3]

So both are scored from 0 to 3. The maximum possible sum would be 6 (3+3). Wait, the task says ""greater than 6"". But if each can only go up to 3, their sum can't exceed 6. So, the only way the total is greater than 6 is if there's a mistake in the data or perhaps a miscalculation. Hmm, maybe I need to check the actual responses.

Let me go through each respondent and add their Assessment and Identification scores.

Starting with Respondent 20:
- Identification: 3
- Assessment: 3
Total: 6. Not greater than 6. So exclude.

Respondent 8:
- Identification: 3
- Assessment: 2
Total: 5. No.

Respondent 22:
- Identification: 3
- Assessment: 2 → 5. No.

Respondent 5:
- Identification: 3
- Assessment: 3 → 6. No.

Respondent 16:
- Identification: 3
- Assessment: 3 → 6. No.

Respondent 23:
- Identification: 3
- Assessment: 3 → 6. No.

Respondent 15:
- Identification: 3
- Assessment: 2 → 5. No.

Respondent 12:
- Identification: 3
- Assessment: 2 → 5. No.

Respondent 7:
- Identification: 3
- Assessment: 2 → 5. No.

Respondent 19:
- Identification: 3
- Assessment: 2 → 5. No.

Wait, all respondents have Identification as 3. The Assessment scores are either 2 or 3. So the maximum total is 6 (3+3). The task asks for a total greater than 6, which is impossible based on the rubric. Therefore, the count should be 0. But let me double-check each entry to make sure I didn't miss any.

Looking again:

All respondents have Identification: 3. The highest Assessment is 3. So 3+3=6. None have a sum over 6. So the answer is 0.

Count the respondents whose total score for 'Identification' and 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is greater than 5.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents whose total score for 'Identification' and 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is greater than 5. 

First, I need to make sure I understand the data structure. The questions section defines each field. 'Identification' and 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' are both rubric-based scores. 

Looking at the questions:
- Question 3 is Identification, with a rubric from 0 to 3.
- Question 9 is Recommendation (global rating scale), also with a rubric from 0 to 3.

The task is to sum each respondent's score for these two questions and count how many have a total greater than 5. 

Now, I'll go through each respondent in the responses and calculate their scores for these two fields. 

Starting with Respondent 16:
- Identification: 3
- Recommendation (GRS): 3
Total: 6. 6 > 5, so count this one.

Respondent 18:
- Identification: 3
- GRS: 2
Total: 5. Not greater than 5. Exclude.

Respondent 7:
- Identification: 3
- GRS: 2
Total: 5. Exclude.

Respondent 8:
- Identification: 3
- GRS: 3
Total: 6. Include.

Respondent 3:
- Identification: 0
- GRS: 3
Total: 3. Exclude.

Respondent 17:
- Identification: 3
- GRS: 2
Total: 5. Exclude.

Respondent 15:
- Identification: 3
- GRS: 2
Total: 5. Exclude.

Respondent 12:
- Identification: 3
- GRS: 3
Total: 6. Include.

Respondent 2:
- Identification: 3
- GRS: 1
Total: 4. Exclude.

Respondent 10:
- Identification: 2
- GRS: 2
Total: 4. Exclude.

Respondent 22:
- Identification: 3
- GRS: 3
Total: 6. Include.

Respondent 1:
- Identification: -1 (Wait, the rubric for Identification is 0-3. But here it's -1. Maybe a typo, but according to the data, we have to take it as is. So -1 + 2 (GRS) = 1. Exclude.)

So the respondents with total >5 are 16, 8, 12, 22. That's 4 respondents. Let me double-check each:

16: 3+3=6 ✅

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who scored 3 on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and whose 'Comments' contain the word 'Overall'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The goal is to count the respondents who scored 3 on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and have the word 'Overall' in their Comments. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' field uses a rubric where 3 means ""Clear comprehensive recommendation without questioning"". So I need to look for all respondents with a score of 3 in that field.

Next, check the 'Comments' section for each of those respondents to see if the word 'Overall' appears. The search should be case-insensitive, but the exact presence of the word matters. 

Looking at the responses:

- Respondent 17: Score 3 in Recommendation (clear recommendation). Comments: ""Concise - clear Satisfactory"". No 'Overall' here.
- Respondent 7: Score 2. Doesn't meet the score requirement.
- Respondent 19: Score 3. Comments mention ""Wrong CPR position"" and ""Clarity is a bit low..."". No 'Overall'.
- Respondent 18: Score 2. Not applicable.
- Respondent 5: Score 2. Doesn't qualify.
- Respondent 6: Score 2. No.
- Respondent 11: Score 3. Comments: ""Clear communication and handover"". No 'Overall'.
- Respondent 15: Score 2. Not applicable.
- Respondent 2: Score 2. No.
- Respondent 23: Score 3. Comments mention ""Time..."" and other notes. No 'Overall'.
- Respondent 4: Score 2. Doesn't meet.
- Respondent 12: Score 3. Comments: ""Good"". No 'Overall'.

After checking all respondents, none of those with a score of 3 in 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' have 'Overall' in their comments. Therefore, the count is 0.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents from the 'I - MI' session who scored 0 on 'Identification' and 2 on 'Situation'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The question is asking to count the respondents from the 'I - MI' session who scored 0 on 'Identification' and 2 on 'Situation'. 

First, I need to identify all respondents who attended the session named 'I - MI'. Looking through the responses:

- Respondent 16 has SessionName: I - MI.
- Respondent 2's SessionName is MI. The task specifies 'I - MI', so I need to check if 'MI' is considered the same. But the exact name in the data is 'I - MI' for Respondent 16, and others like Respondent 2 have 'MI' which might be a different session. So probably, only Respondent 16 is in 'I - MI'.

Next, check their scores. For Respondent 16:
- Identification: 3
- Situation: 3

These don't meet the criteria of 0 on Identification and 2 on Situation. 

Looking at other respondents, maybe I missed someone. Let me check all SessionName entries again. 

Respondent 3: III-Sepsis
Respondent 17: V (Hypoglycemia)
Respondent 15: III - Sepsis
Respondent 2: MI
Respondent 20: IV (VT)
Respondent 5: II - Anaphylaxsis
Respondent 14: IV-Hypoglycemia
Respondent 8: III (Sepsis)
Respondent 10: (MI)-VT
Respondent 1: V (Hypoglycemia)
Respondent 9: II (Anaphylaxsis)

No other respondents have 'I - MI' as their SessionName. So only Respondent 16 is in that session. But their scores don't match. Therefore, the count is 0.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Situation' and 'Background (history)' is greater than 3.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The question is asking to count the respondents whose total score for 'Situation' and 'Background (history)' is greater than 3. 

First, I need to make sure I understand the data structure. The 'Questions' section lists each question with their respective rubrics. For this task, we're focusing on two specific questions: 

4. Situation: Scored from 0 to 3.
5. Background (history): Also scored from 0 to 3.

The task is to sum the scores of these two questions for each respondent and count how many have a total greater than 3.

Now, I'll go through each respondent in the 'Responses' section and calculate their combined scores for Situation and Background (history). 

Let's list out each respondent:

- **Respondent 22**: Situation=3, Background (history)=3 → 3+3=6. 6>3 → count.
- **Respondent 10**: Situation=2, Background (history)=2 → 2+2=4. 4>3 → count.
- **Respondent 1**: Situation=2, Background (history)=2 → 2+2=4. 4>3 → count.
- **Respondent 13**: Situation=3, Background (history)=2 → 3+2=5. 5>3 → count.
- **Respondent 9**: Situation=3, Background (history)=2 → 3+2=5. 5>3 → count.
- **Respondent 21**: Situation=2, Background (history)=3 → 2+3=5. 5>3 → count.
- **Respondent 7**: Situation=3, Background (history)=2 → 3+2=5. 5>3 → count.
- **Respondent 3**: Situation=2, Background (history)=3 → 2+3=5. 5>3 → count.
- **Respondent 18**: Situation=3, Background (history)=2 → 3+2=5. 5>3 → count.
- **Respondent 17**: Situation=3, Background (history)=3 → 3+3=6. 6>3 → count.
- **Respondent 6**: Situation=2, Background (history)=3 → 2+3=5. 5>3 → count.

Now, let's count how many of these meet the condition. 

Looking at each:

- Respondent 22: Yes
- Respondent 10: Yes
- Respondent 1: Yes
- Respondent 13: Yes
- Respondent 9: Yes
- Respondent 21: Yes
- Respondent 7: Yes
- Respondent 3: Yes
- Respondent 18: Yes
- Respondent 17: Yes
- Respondent 6: Yes

That's 11 respondents in total. Wait, but let me check again. Each of the 11 respondents listed here has a sum greater than 3. Let me verify each calculation again to be sure.

Yes, all the sums are either 4, 5, or 6, which are all greater than 3. So the total count is 11.

</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents whose 'Identification' score is higher than the average 'Identification' score for all sessions on the same date. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The data provided includes multiple respondents, each with a 'Date' and an 'Identification' score. The 'Identification' rubric is from 0 to 3. 

The plan is:
1. For each respondent, determine the average 'Identification' score of all respondents who share the same date.
2. Compare the individual's 'Identification' score to that average.
3. Count how many respondents have a score higher than their date's average.

Let's start by listing all the respondents and their dates and Identification scores:

- Respondent 18: 2025-05-04, Identification 3
- Respondent 2: 2025-04-04, Identification 3
- Respondent 3: 2025-04-04, Identification 0
- Respondent 16: 2025-05-02, Identification 3
- Respondent 22: 2025-05-16, Identification 3
- Respondent 10: 2025-03-14, Identification 2
- Respondent 14: 2025-03-14, Identification 3
- Respondent 6: 2025-04-04, Identification 3

Now, group them by date:

2025-03-14: Respondents 10 (2) and 14 (3)
2025-04-04: Respondents 2 (3), 3 (0), 6 (3)
2025-05-02: Respondent 16 (3)
2025-05-04: Respondent 18 (3)
2025-05-16: Respondent 22 (3)

Next, calculate the average for each date:

For 2025-03-14: (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5
For 2025-04-04: (3 + 0 + 3) / 3 = 6/3 = 2
For 2025-05-02: Only 3, average is 3
For 2025-05-04: Only 3, average is 3
For 2025-05-16: Only 3, average is 3

Now, compare each respondent's score to their date's average:

- Respondent 18 (3 vs 3): 3 is not higher than 3 → no
- Respondent 2 (3 vs 2): 3 > 2 → yes
- Respondent 3 (0 vs 2): 0 < 2 → no
- Respondent 16 (3 vs 3): no
- Respondent 22 (3 vs 3): no
- Respondent 10 (2 vs 2.5): 2 < 2.5 → no
- Respondent 14 (3 vs 2.5): 3 > 2.5 → yes
- Respondent 6 (3 vs 2): 3 > 2 → yes

So, the respondents who meet the criteria are Respondent 2, 14, and 6. That's a total of 3 respondents.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score across all rubric items is below the average total score for all sessions.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the number of respondents whose total score across all rubric items is below the average total score for all sessions. 

First, I need to understand which fields are rubric items. Looking at the questions section, the rubric items are questions 3 through 9. Each of these has a score from 0 to 3. So, for each respondent, I need to sum their scores for Identification (3), Situation (4), Background (history) (5), Background (examination) (6), Assessment (7), Recommendation (clear recommendation) (8), and Recommendation (global rating scale) (9). 

Next, I'll go through each respondent and calculate their total scores. Let's list them out:

Starting with Respondent 21:
- Identification: 3
- Situation: 2
- Background (history): 3
- Background (examination): 1
- Assessment: 2
- Recommendation (clear recommendation): 3
- Recommendation (global rating scale): 3
Total = 3+2+3+1+2+3+3 = 17

Respondent 23:
Scores: 3,3,2,2,3,3,3 → 3+3+2+2+3+3+3 = 19

Respondent 14:
Scores: 3,3,2,2,3,1,2 → 3+3+2+2+3+1+2 = 16

Respondent 12:
Scores: 3,3,3,3,2,3,3 → 3+3+3+3+2+3+3 = 20

Respondent 13:
Scores: 3,3,2,1,2,2,2 → 3+3+2+1+2+2+2 = 15

Respondent 15:
Scores: 3,3,2,3,2,2,2 → 3+3+2+3+2+2+2 = 17

Respondent 19:
Scores: 3,3,3,3,2,3,3 → 3+3+3+3+2+3+3 = 20

Respondent 17:
Scores: 3,3,3,3,3,3,2 → 3+3+3+3+3+3+2 = 20

Respondent 2:
Scores: 3,3,2,3,3,2,1 → 3+3+2+3+3+2+1 = 17

Now, let's list all the totals:
- 21:17, 23:19, 14:16, 12:20, 13:15, 15:17, 19:20, 17:20, 2:17

Next, calculate the average total score. Sum all these totals and divide by the number of respondents (9).

Sum = 17+19+16+20+15+17+20+20+17 = 17+19=36; 36+16=52; 52+20=72; 72+15=87; 87+17=104; 104+20=124; 124+20=144; 144+17=161.

Average = 161 / 9 ≈ 17.888...

So the average total score is approximately 17.89. Now, we need to count how many respondents have a total below this average. 

Looking at the totals:
- 17 (Respondent 21, 15, 2) → 17 is below 17.89? Wait, 17 is less than 17.89, so yes.
- 16 (Respondent 14)
- 15 (Respondent 13)

So the respondents with totals below 17.89 are:
Respondent 14 (16), 13 (15), 21 (17), 15 (17), 2 (17). Wait, wait, 17 is 17, which is less than 17.89. So 17 is below the average. Let me check each:

- 21:17 → below
- 23:19 → above
- 14:16 → below
- 12:20 → above
- 13:15 → below
- 15:17 → below
- 19:20 → above
- 17:20 → above
- 2:17 → below

So that's 21,14,13,15,2. That's 5 respondents. Wait, let me recount:

Respondent 21:17 → yes
Respondent 14:16 → yes
Respondent 13:15 → yes
Respondent 15:17 → yes
Respondent 2:17 → yes
That's 5. But wait, the sum of their totals is 17+16+15+17+17 = 82. Wait, but the average is 17.89. So each of these 5 have totals below or equal? Wait, 17 is less than 17.89, so yes. So 5 respondents. 

Wait, but the initial calculation of the average was 161/9 ≈17.888... So 17.89. So any total less than that. So 17 is below. So the count is 5. 

But let me check each respondent's total again to be sure:

Respondent 21:17 → below
Respondent 23:19 → above
Respondent 14:16 → below
Respondent 12:20 → above
Respondent 13:15 → below
Respondent 15:17 → below
Respondent 19:20 → above
Respondent 17:20 → above
Respondent 2:17 → below

So that's 5 respondents: 21,14,13,15,2. So the answer should be 5. But wait, let me check the totals again. 

Wait, the totals for each:

21:3+2+3+1+2+3+3=17

14:3+3+2+2+3+1+2=16

13:3+3+2+1+2+2+2=15

15:3+3+2+3+2+2+2=17

2:3+3+2+3+3+2+1=17

So yes, those five have totals below 17.89. So the count is 5.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose 'Background (examination)' score is equal to the average 'Background (examination)' score for all sessions that occurred on the same date.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the number of respondents whose 'Background (examination)' score equals the average 'Background (examination)' score for all sessions that occurred on the same date. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The dataset includes multiple respondents, each with a Date and a 'Background (examination)' score. The goal is to group respondents by their Date, calculate the average score for each date, and then count how many respondents on each date have a score equal to that average. Finally, sum those counts across all dates.

Let me start by listing all the respondents and their dates along with their 'Background (examination)' scores. 

Looking at the responses:

- Respondent 5: 2025-05-04, score 3
- Respondent 21: 2025-05-16, score 1
- Respondent 12: 2025-05-02, score 3
- Respondent 4: 2025-05-16, score 2
- Respondent 6: 2025-04-04, score 3
- Respondent 18: 2025-05-04, score 2
- Respondent 13: 2025-03-14, score 1
- Respondent 23: 2025-03-14, score 2
- Respondent 22: 2025-05-16, score 3
- Respondent 20: 2025-05-02, score -1
- Respondent 1: 2025-05-02, score 2
- Respondent 17: 2025-05-04, score 3

Now, group them by date:

2025-03-14:
- Respondent 13: 1
- Respondent 23: 2
Average for this date: (1 + 2)/2 = 1.5. So, no one here has a score equal to 1.5.

2025-04-04:
- Respondent 6: 3
Average is 3. So, this respondent's score equals the average. Count = 1.

2025-05-02:
- Respondent 12: 3
- Respondent 20: -1
- Respondent 1: 2
Average: (3 + (-1) + 2)/3 = (4)/3 ≈ 1.333. None of the scores (3, -1, 2) equal 1.333. So count 0.

2025-05-04:
- Respondent 5: 3
- Respondent 18: 2
- Respondent 17: 3
Average: (3 + 2 + 3)/3 = 8/3 ≈ 2.666. No scores equal this average. Count 0.

2025-05-16:
- Respondent 21: 1
- Respondent 4: 2
- Respondent 22: 3
Average: (1 + 2 + 3)/3 = 6/3 = 2. So, Respondent 4 has a score of 2, which equals the average. Count = 1.

Adding up the counts from each date where the score equals the average: 1 (from 2025-04-04) + 1 (from 2025-05-16) = 2.

Wait, but let me double-check. For 2025-04-04, only Respondent 6 is present with a score of 3. The average is 3, so that's 1. For 2025-05-16, the average is 2, and Respondent 4 has a score of 2. So that's another 1. Total of 2. Are there any other dates?

Wait, what about 2025-03-14: average 1.5. No one has 1.5. 2025-05-02: average ~1.333, no matches. 2025-05-04: average ~2.666, no matches. So total is 2. But wait, let me check again.

Wait, Respondent 6 is on 2025-04-04 with score 3. The average is 3, so that's 1. Then 2025-05-16 has three respondents: 1,2,3. Average is 2. Respondent 4 has 2. So that's 1. Total 2. So the answer should be 2.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who participated in a session where the average 'Assessment' for that session name is greater than 1.5.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents who participated in a session where the average 'Assessment' score for that session name is greater than 1.5. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The data provided includes multiple respondents, each with a SessionName and an Assessment score. The Assessment is a rubric-based score from 0 to 3. 

The key here is to group the respondents by their SessionName, calculate the average Assessment score for each session, and then count all respondents in sessions where that average is above 1.5.

Let me start by listing all the respondents along with their SessionName and Assessment scores:

- Respondent 15: SessionName ""III - Sepsis"", Assessment 2
- Respondent 22: SessionName ""IV (VT)"", Assessment 2
- Respondent 18: SessionName ""IV - VT"", Assessment 3
- Respondent 14: SessionName ""IV-Hypoglycemia"", Assessment 3
- Respondent 21: SessionName ""I (Myocardial infarction)"", Assessment 2
- Respondent 13: SessionName ""I-VF"", Assessment 2
- Respondent 8: SessionName ""III (Sepsis)"", Assessment 2
- Respondent 17: SessionName ""V (Hypoglycemia)"", Assessment 3
- Respondent 16: SessionName ""I - MI"", Assessment 3
- Respondent 6: SessionName ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"", Assessment 2

Now, I need to group these by SessionName. Let's see:

1. III - Sepsis: Respondents 15 and 8. Their Assessment scores are 2 and 2. Average = (2+2)/2 = 2.0
2. IV (VT) and IV - VT: These might be the same session. Let's check. The SessionNames are ""IV (VT)"" (Respondent 22) and ""IV - VT"" (Respondent 18). The naming is slightly different, but ""VT"" likely stands for the same thing. So combining these two, the scores are 2 and 3. Average = (2+3)/2 = 2.5
3. IV-Hypoglycemia: Respondent 14, Assessment 3. Average = 3.0
4. I (Myocardial infarction): Respondent 21, Assessment 2. Average = 2.0
5. I-VF: Respondent 13, Assessment 2. Average = 2.0
6. V (Hypoglycemia): Respondent 17, Assessment 3. Average = 3.0
7. I - MI: Respondent 16, Assessment 3. Average = 3.0
8. II (Anaphylactic Shock): Respondent 6, Assessment 2. Average = 2.0

Wait, but I need to check if SessionNames that are similar but written differently are considered the same. For example, ""III - Sepsis"" vs. ""III (Sepsis)""—probably the same session. Similarly, ""IV (VT)"" vs. ""IV - VT""—likely the same. Let me confirm:

- ""III - Sepsis"" (Respondent 15) and ""III (Sepsis)"" (Respondent 8): These are the same session name, just different formatting. So combining them: Assessments 2 and 2. Average remains 2.0.

- ""IV (VT)"" (Respondent 22) and ""IV - VT"" (Respondent 18): Again, same session, different formatting. So their Assessments are 2 and 3. Average 2.5.

- ""IV-Hypoglycemia"" (Respondent 14) and ""V (Hypoglycemia)"" (Respondent 17): These are different sessions (IV vs. V), so they should be treated separately.

- ""I (Myocardial infarction)"" (Respondent 21), ""I-VF"" (Respondent 13), and ""I - MI"" (Respondent 16): ""I"" here might refer to different sessions. ""Myocardial infarction"" and ""MI"" are the same, so ""I (Myocardial infarction)"" and ""I - MI"" are the same session. But ""I-VF"" is a different condition (Ventricular Fibrillation), so it's a separate session.

So correcting the groups:

1. III Sepsis (Respondents 15 and 8): Average 2.0
2. IV VT (Respondents 22 and 18): Average 2.5
3. IV-Hypoglycemia (Respondent 14): 3.0
4. I Myocardial Infarction (Respondents 21 and 16): Wait, Respondent 16's SessionName is ""I - MI"" which is Myocardial Infarction. So combining Respondent 21 (Assessment 2) and 16 (Assessment 3): Average (2+3)/2 = 2.5
5. I-VF (Respondent 13): 2.0
6. V Hypoglycemia (Respondent 17): 3.0
7. II Anaphylactic Shock (Respondent 6): 2.0

Now, calculate the average for each session:

- III Sepsis: 2.0 > 1.5 → include
- IV VT: 2.5 > 1.5 → include
- IV-Hypoglycemia: 3.0 > 1.5 → include
- I Myocardial Infarction (MI): 2.5 > 1.5 → include
- I-VF: 2.0 > 1.5 → include
- V Hypoglycemia: 3.0 > 1.5 → include
- II Anaphylactic Shock: 2.0 > 1.5 → include

Wait, all sessions except maybe none? Let me check each:

All the calculated averages are above 1.5. Wait, the lowest average here is 2.0. So all sessions have an average Assessment greater than 1.5. Therefore, all respondents are part of sessions that meet the criteria. 

But wait, let me check again. The task is to count respondents in sessions where the average Assessment is >1.5. If all sessions have an average above 1.5, then all 10 respondents are included. But looking back at the data:

Wait, the original data has 10 respondents. Let me recount:

Respondent 15,22,18,14,21,13,8,17,16,6 → 10 respondents. If all sessions have average >1.5, then the answer is 10. But wait, let me check each session again.

Wait, the session ""I-VF"" (Respondent 13) has an average of 2.0 (since it's only one respondent with Assessment 2). So that's 2.0, which is above 1.5. Similarly, ""II Anaphylactic Shock"" (Respondent 6) has average 2.0. All others are higher. So yes, all sessions have averages above 1.5. Therefore, all 10 respondents should be counted. But wait, looking at the example given in the problem, the answer was 0. But that was for a different question. However, in this case, according to the data, all sessions have an average Assessment greater than 1.5. Therefore, the count should be 10. But let me verify again.

Wait, let's list each session and their average:

1. III Sepsis: Respondents 15 (2) and 8 (2) → average 2.0
2. IV VT: Respondents 22 (2) and 18 (3) → average 2.5
3. IV-Hypoglycemia: Respondent 14 (3) → average 3.0
4. I Myocardial Infarction: Respondents 21 (2) and 16 (3) → average 2.5
5. I-VF: Respondent 13 (2) → average 2.0
6. V Hypoglycemia: Respondent 17 (3) → average 3.0
7. II Anaphylactic Shock: Respondent 6 (2) → average 2.0

All these averages are above 1.5. Therefore, all 10 respondents are in sessions where the average Assessment is greater than 1.5. So the answer should be 10. But wait, the example in the problem had an answer of 0, but that was for a different question. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in grouping the sessions. Let me check again:

- SessionName for Respondent 21 is ""I (Myocardial infarction)"", and Respondent 16 is ""I - MI"". Are these considered the same session? ""MI"" stands for Myocardial Infarction, so yes. So combining those two, their average is (2+3)/2=2.5. So that's correct.

- Respondent 13's SessionName is ""I-VF"", which is a different session (VF is Ventricular Fibrillation), so it's a separate session with one respondent.

So all sessions have averages >=2.0, which is above 1.5. Therefore, all 10 respondents are included. But the data provided in the questionnaire has 10 respondents. Let me count again:

Respondent 15,22,18,14,21,13,8,17,16,6 → that's 10 respondents. So the answer should be 10. But wait, in the example, the answer was 0, but that was for a different question. So in this case, the correct answer is 10. But I need to make sure I didn't miss any session that has an average <=1.5.

Wait, let's check each session's average again:

- III Sepsis: 2.0
- IV VT: 2.5
- IV-Hypoglycemia: 3.0
- I Myocardial Infarction: 2.5
- I-VF: 2.0
- V Hypoglycemia: 3.0
- II Anaphylactic Shock: 2.0

All of these are above 1.5. Therefore, all respondents are part of sessions that meet the criteria. So the count is 10.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose 'Background (examination)' is higher than the average 'Background (examination)' for all sessions on the same date.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents whose 'Background (examination)' score is higher than the average 'Background (examination)' for all sessions on the same date. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The 'Background (examination)' is question 6 in the survey, with a rubric from 0 to 3. Each respondent has a date, and their score for this question. 

The approach should be:
1. For each respondent, determine their date and their 'Background (examination)' score.
2. For each date, calculate the average 'Background (examination)' score of all respondents on that date.
3. Compare each respondent's score to the average of their respective date.
4. Count how many respondents have a score higher than their date's average.

Let's start by extracting all the respondents' dates and their corresponding 'Background (examination)' scores. 

Looking at the responses:

- Respondent 9: 2025-05-04, score 2
- Respondent 7: 2025-03-14, score 3
- Respondent 4: 2025-05-16, score 2
- Respondent 2: 2025-04-04, score 3
- Respondent 14: 2025-03-14, score 2
- Respondent 1: 2025-05-02, score 2
- Respondent 8: 2025-05-02, score 2
- Respondent 22: 2025-05-16, score 3
- Respondent 20: 2025-05-02, score -1 (but wait, the rubric is 0-3. A score of -1 might be an invalid entry or a typo. However, according to the data provided, we have to take it as is. So we'll include it in calculations unless specified otherwise.)

Wait, the rubric for 'Background (examination)' is 0 to 3. A score of -1 isn't part of the rubric. But the data shows Respondent 1 has Identification: -1, which is also outside the rubric for that question. So perhaps these are data entry errors. However, the problem doesn't mention handling invalid scores, so we'll proceed with the given values, treating -1 as a valid entry for the purpose of this calculation. 

But let's check the data again. For Respondent 20, 'Background (examination)' is -1. Since the rubric is 0-3, this might be a mistake, but the data includes it, so we have to consider it. However, when calculating the average, this -1 will affect the average for 2025-05-02. 

Now, let's group the respondents by date and calculate the average for each date.

First, list all dates and their corresponding scores:

2025-05-04: [2] (only Respondent 9)
Average: 2

2025-03-14: [3 (Respondent 7), 2 (Respondent 14)] → sum 5, average 2.5

2025-05-16: [2 (Respondent 4), 3 (Respondent 22)] → sum 5, average 2.5

2025-04-04: [3 (Respondent 2)] → average 3

2025-05-02: [2 (Respondent 1), 2 (Respondent 8), -1 (Respondent 20)] → sum 3, average 1.0

Now, for each respondent, compare their score to the average of their date:

- Respondent 9: score 2 vs. average 2 → not higher. So no.
- Respondent 7: 3 vs. 2.5 → higher. Yes.
- Respondent 4: 2 vs. 2.5 → lower. No.
- Respondent 2: 3 vs. 3 → equal. Not higher. No.
- Respondent 14: 2 vs. 2.5 → lower. No.
- Respondent 1: 2 vs. 1.0 → higher. Yes.
- Respondent 8: 2 vs. 1.0 → higher. Yes.
- Respondent 22: 3 vs. 2.5 → higher. Yes.
- Respondent 20: -1 vs. 1.0 → -1 is lower than 1.0. No.

So the respondents with scores higher than their date's average are:

Respondent 7, 1, 8, 22. That's four respondents.

Wait, let's double-check:

For 2025-05-02, average is 1.0. Respondents 1 and 8 have 2, which is higher. Respondent 20 has -1, which is lower. So two here.

Respondent 7 (3) on 2025-03-14 (average 2.5) → yes.

Respondent 22 (3) on 2025-05-16 (average 2.5) → yes.

So total of 4 respondents: 7, 1, 8, 22.

Wait, but let's count again:

Respondent 7: yes (3 > 2.5)
Respondent 1: 2 > 1.0 → yes
Respondent 8: 2 > 1.0 → yes
Respondent 22: 3 > 2.5 → yes
That's four.

But wait, are there any others?

Respondent 2: 3 vs. 3 → equal, so no.

So total of 4 respondents. But let's check the data again to make sure.

Wait, the data for Respondent 20 is on 2025-05-02 with a score of -1. The average for that date is (2 + 2 + (-1)) /3 = 3/3 = 1.0. So yes, the average is 1.0. So 2 is higher than 1.0. So respondents 1 and 8 on that date have 2, which is higher. So two there.

Respondent 7 and 22 are the other two. So total 4.

Therefore, the answer should be 4.

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who participated in a session where the average 'Assessment' for that session name is greater than 2.0.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents who participated in a session where the average 'Assessment' score for that session name is greater than 2.0. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The 'Assessment' question is question 7, and its rubric is from 0 to 3. Each respondent is part of a session with a specific SessionName. The goal is to group respondents by their SessionName, calculate the average Assessment score for each session, and then count how many respondents are in sessions where this average is above 2.0.

Let me start by listing all the respondents along with their SessionName and Assessment scores:

- Respondent 20: SessionName ""IV (VT)"", Assessment 3
- Respondent 2: SessionName ""MI"", Assessment 3
- Respondent 15: SessionName ""III - Sepsis"", Assessment 2
- Respondent 23: SessionName ""II-Anaphylaxsis"", Assessment 3
- Respondent 22: SessionName ""IV (VT)"", Assessment 2
- Respondent 8: SessionName ""III (Sepsis)"", Assessment 2
- Respondent 19: SessionName ""I - MI"", Assessment 2
- Respondent 13: SessionName ""I-VF"", Assessment 2

Now, group them by SessionName:

1. IV (VT): Respondents 20 and 22. Their Assessment scores are 3 and 2. Average = (3 + 2)/2 = 2.5. This is greater than 2.0, so both respondents count.

2. MI: Respondent 2. Assessment 3. Average is 3.0. Greater than 2.0. This respondent counts.

3. III - Sepsis: Respondent 15. Assessment 2. Average 2.0. Not greater than 2.0. Exclude.

4. II-Anaphylaxsis: Respondent 23. Assessment 3. Average 3.0. Greater than 2.0. Counts.

5. III (Sepsis): Respondent 8. Assessment 2. Average 2.0. Exclude.

6. I - MI: Respondent 19. Assessment 2. Average 2.0. Exclude.

7. I-VF: Respondent 13. Assessment 2. Average 2.0. Exclude.

Wait, but I need to check if SessionNames are case-sensitive or if variations matter. For example, ""III - Sepsis"" vs. ""III (Sepsis)""—are they considered the same session? The data shows different SessionNames: ""III - Sepsis"" (Respondent 15) and ""III (Sepsis)"" (Respondent 8). Since the names are written differently, they should be treated as separate sessions. Similarly, ""MI"" (Respondent 2) and ""I - MI"" (Respondent 19) might be different sessions. So each unique SessionName is a separate group.

So recalculating the groups:

- IV (VT): 2 respondents (20,22) → average 2.5 → include both.
- MI: 1 respondent (2) → average 3.0 → include.
- II-Anaphylaxsis: 1 respondent (23) → average 3.0 → include.
- The rest have averages ≤2.0.

Total respondents in qualifying sessions: 2 (IV (VT)) + 1 (MI) + 1 (II-Anaphylaxsis) = 4.

Wait, but let me double-check. Are there any other sessions with average >2.0?

Looking again:

- Session ""IV (VT)"" has two respondents: 3 and 2 → average 2.5.
- Session ""MI"" (Respondent 2) → 3 → average 3.0.
- Session ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" (Respondent 23) → 3 → average 3.0.
- All other sessions have either one respondent with 2 (average 2.0) or two respondents with 2 each (like if there were others, but in this data, no). 

So the qualifying sessions are IV (VT), MI, and II-Anaphylaxsis. The respondents in these sessions are 20, 22, 2, and 23. That's four respondents. 

Therefore, the answer should be 4.

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score across all rubric items is below the average total score for all sessions.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the number of respondents whose total score across all rubric items is below the average total score for all sessions. 

First, I need to understand which fields are rubric items. Looking at the questions section, the rubric items are questions 3 through 9. Each of these has a rubric with scores from 0 to 3. So, for each respondent, I need to sum their scores for Identification (Q3), Situation (Q4), Background (history) (Q5), Background (examination) (Q6), Assessment (Q7), Recommendation (clear recommendation) (Q8), and Recommendation (global rating scale) (Q9). 

Next, I need to calculate the total score for each respondent. Let's list out all the respondents and their scores:

Starting with Respondent 8:
- Q3: 3, Q4:3, Q5:3, Q6:2, Q7:2, Q8:2, Q9:3. Total = 3+3+3+2+2+2+3 = 18.

Respondent 18:
- 3,3,2,2,3,2,2. Total = 3+3+2+2+3+2+2 = 17.

Respondent 7:
- 3,3,2,3,2,2,2. Total = 3+3+2+3+2+2+2 = 17.

Respondent 2:
- 3,3,2,3,3,2,1. Total = 3+3+2+3+3+2+1 = 17.

Respondent 5:
- 3,3,3,3,3,2,3. Total = 3+3+3+3+3+2+3 = 20.

Respondent 17:
- 3,3,3,3,3,3,2. Total = 3+3+3+3+3+3+2 = 20.

Respondent 10:
- 2,2,2,2,2,2,2. Total = 2*7 =14.

Respondent 23:
- 3,3,2,2,3,3,3. Total = 3+3+2+2+3+3+3 = 19.

Respondent 14:
- 3,3,2,2,3,1,2. Total = 3+3+2+2+3+1+2 =16.

Respondent 12:
- 3,3,3,3,2,3,3. Total = 3+3+3+3+2+3+3=20.

Respondent 22:
- 3,3,3,3,2,2,3. Total =3+3+3+3+2+2+3=19.

Now, let's list all the totals:
18,17,17,17,20,20,14,19,16,20,19.

Next, calculate the average total score. Sum all these totals and divide by the number of respondents (11).

Sum = 18+17=35; 35+17=52; 52+17=69; 69+20=89; 89+20=109; 109+14=123; 123+19=142; 142+16=158; 158+20=178; 178+19=197. Total sum is 197.

Average = 197 / 11 ≈ 17.909. So approximately 17.91.

Now, find how many respondents have a total below this average. The average is about 17.91, so scores below 17.91 are 17 and below. Let's check each total:

- 18: above
- 17: below
- 17: below
- 17: below
- 20: above
- 20: above
- 14: below
- 19: above
- 16: below
- 20: above
- 19: above

So the respondents with totals below 17.91 are: Respondent 18 (17), Respondent 7 (17), Respondent 2 (17), Respondent 10 (14), Respondent 14 (16). That's 5 respondents.

Wait, let me recount:

Looking at the list:

18 (18) → above

17 (17) → below

17 (17) → below

17 (17) → below

20 → above

20 → above

14 → below

19 → above

16 → below

20 → above

19 → above

So the below-average totals are at 17,17,17,14,16. That's 5 respondents. So the count is 5.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the respondents whose 'Assessment' is higher than the average 'Assessment' for all sessions on the same date.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents whose 'Assessment' score is higher than the average 'Assessment' for all sessions on the same date. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The 'Assessment' question is question 7, with a rubric from 0 to 3. Each respondent has a Date and an Assessment score. 

The plan is:
1. For each respondent, determine their date and Assessment score.
2. For each date, calculate the average Assessment score of all respondents on that date.
3. Compare each respondent's Assessment score to the average of their respective date.
4. Count how many respondents have a score higher than the average.

Let's start by extracting all the respondents' dates and Assessment scores. Looking at the data:

- Respondent 19: Date 2025-05-16, Assessment 2
- Respondent 20: 2025-05-02, 3
- Respondent 11: 2025-04-04, 3
- Respondent 8: 2025-05-02, 2
- Respondent 10: 2025-03-14, 2
- Respondent 5: 2025-05-04, 3
- Respondent 17: 2025-05-04, 3
- Respondent 22: 2025-05-16, 2
- Respondent 7: 2025-03-14, 2
- Respondent 18: 2025-05-04, 3

Now, group them by date:

2025-03-14: Respondents 10 and 7. Both have Assessment 2. Average = (2+2)/2 = 2.0
2025-04-04: Respondent 11. Score 3. Average = 3.0
2025-05-02: Respondents 20 and 8. Scores 3 and 2. Average = (3+2)/2 = 2.5
2025-05-04: Respondents 5, 17, 18. All have 3. Average = (3+3+3)/3 = 3.0
2025-05-16: Respondents 19 and 22. Both have 2. Average = 2.0

Next, compare each respondent's score to their date's average:

- Respondent 19 (2025-05-16, 2 vs 2.0): 2 is not higher than 2.0 → No
- Respondent 20 (2025-05-02, 3 vs 2.5): 3 > 2.5 → Yes
- Respondent 11 (2025-04-04, 3 vs 3.0): 3 is not higher than 3 → No
- Respondent 8 (2025-05-02, 2 vs 2.5): 2 < 2.5 → No
- Respondent 10 (2025-03-14, 2 vs 2.0): No
- Respondent 5 (2025-05-04, 3 vs 3.0): No
- Respondent 17 (2025-05-04, 3 vs 3.0): No
- Respondent 22 (2025-05-16, 2 vs 2.0): No
- Respondent 7 (2025-03-14, 2 vs 2.0): No
- Respondent 18 (2025-05-04, 3 vs 3.0): No

Only Respondent 20 has an Assessment score higher than the average for their date. So the count is 1.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' score is equal to the average 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' score for all sessions that occurred on the same date.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the number of respondents whose 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' score equals the average score of all sessions on the same date. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' is a rubric-based score with values from 0 to 3. Each respondent has a date and a score for this category. 

The plan is:
1. Calculate the average 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' score for each date.
2. For each respondent, compare their score to the average of their respective date.
3. Count how many respondents meet the condition where their score equals the average of their date.

Let's start by listing all the respondents and their dates and scores. From the data:

Respondent 2: Date 2025-04-04, Score 2
Respondent 18: 2025-05-04, Score 2
Respondent 19: 2025-05-16, Score 3
Respondent 6: 2025-04-04, Score 2
Respondent 14: 2025-03-14, Score 1
Respondent 22: 2025-05-16, Score 2
Respondent 16: 2025-05-02, Score 2
Respondent 23: 2025-03-14, Score 3
Respondent 20: 2025-05-02, Score 2
Respondent 11: 2025-04-04, Score 3

Now, group them by date:

2025-03-14: Respondents 14 (1), 23 (3) → Average = (1 + 3)/2 = 2
2025-04-04: Respondents 2 (2), 6 (2), 11 (3) → Sum = 2+2+3=7 → Average = 7/3 ≈ 2.333...
2025-05-02: Respondents 16 (2), 20 (2) → Average = (2+2)/2 = 2
2025-05-04: Respondent 18 (2) → Average = 2
2025-05-16: Respondents 19 (3), 22 (2) → Average = (3+2)/2 = 2.5

Next, check each respondent's score against their date's average:

- Respondent 14 (2025-03-14, score 1) vs average 2 → Not equal.
- Respondent 23 (2025-03-14, score 3) vs average 2 → Not equal.
- Respondent 2 (2025-04-04, 2) vs 2.333 → No.
- Respondent 6 (2025-04-04, 2) vs 2.333 → No.
- Respondent 11 (2025-04-04, 3) vs 2.333 → No.
- Respondent 18 (2025-05-04, 2) vs 2 → Yes.
- Respondent 16 (2025-05-02, 2) vs 2 → Yes.
- Respondent 20 (2025-05-02, 2) vs 2 → Yes.
- Respondent 19 (2025-05-16, 3) vs 2.5 → No.
- Respondent 22 (2025-05-16, 2) vs 2.5 → No.

So, the respondents who meet the condition are 18, 16, 20. That's three respondents. Therefore, the answer is 3.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose 'Background (examination)' is higher than the average 'Background (examination)' for all sessions on the same date.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents whose 'Background (examination)' score is higher than the average 'Background (examination)' for all sessions on the same date. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The 'Background (examination)' is question 6 in the survey, with a rubric from 0 to 3. Each respondent has a date and a score for this question. 

The main steps I need to perform are:
1. Calculate the average 'Background (examination)' score for each date.
2. For each respondent, compare their score to the average of their respective date.
3. Count how many respondents have a score higher than their date's average.

Let me start by listing all the respondents and their dates along with their 'Background (examination)' scores. 

Looking at the responses:

- Respondent 17: Date 2025-05-04, Score 3
- Respondent 11: 2025-04-04, 3
- Respondent 14: 2025-03-14, 2
- Respondent 21: 2025-05-16, 1
- Respondent 5: 2025-05-04, 3
- Respondent 10: 2025-03-14, 2
- Respondent 13: 2025-03-14, 1
- Respondent 6: 2025-04-04, 3
- Respondent 23: 2025-03-14, 2
- Respondent 9: 2025-05-04, 2
- Respondent 8: 2025-05-02, 2

Now, group them by date and calculate the average for each group.

Starting with 2025-03-14:
Respondents 14, 10, 13, 23. Their scores are 2, 2, 1, 2. Sum is 7. Number of respondents is 4. Average is 7/4 = 1.75.

2025-04-04:
Respondents 11 and 6. Both have 3. Sum 6, average 3.

2025-05-02:
Only Respondent 8 with score 2. Average is 2.

2025-05-04:
Respondents 17, 5, 9. Scores 3, 3, 2. Sum 8. Average 8/3 ≈ 2.666...

2025-05-16:
Only Respondent 21 with score 1. Average is 1.

Now, compare each respondent's score to their date's average.

For 2025-03-14 (average 1.75):
- Respondent 14: 2 > 1.75 → yes
- Respondent 10: 2 > 1.75 → yes
- Respondent 13: 1 < 1.75 → no
- Respondent 23: 2 > 1.75 → yes
So 3 respondents here.

2025-04-04 (average 3):
Both respondents have 3, which is equal, not higher. So 0.

2025-05-02 (average 2):
Respondent 8 has 2 → equal. So 0.

2025-05-04 (average ~2.67):
- Respondent 17: 3 > 2.67 → yes
- Respondent 5: 3 > 2.67 → yes
- Respondent 9: 2 < 2.67 → no
So 2 here.

2025-05-16 (average 1):
Respondent 21 has 1 → equal. So 0.

Adding them up: 3 (from 2025-03-14) + 2 (from 2025-05-04) = 5 total respondents.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations. 

For 2025-03-14, the average is 1.75. Scores above that are 2 and 2. So three respondents (14,10,23) have 2, which is higher than 1.75. Correct.

For 2025-05-04, average is 8/3 ≈ 2.666. Respondents 17 and 5 have 3, which is higher. So two. 

Total is 3 + 2 = 5. 

So the answer should be 5.
