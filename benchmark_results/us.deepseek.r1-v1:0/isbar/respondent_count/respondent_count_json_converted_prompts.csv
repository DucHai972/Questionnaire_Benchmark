<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who participated in a 'II-Anaphylaxsis' session.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task. The user wants to count the respondents who participated in a 'II-Anaphylaxsis' session. First, I need to look at the data provided.

Looking at the 'responses' array, each respondent has an 'answers' object that includes 'SessionName'. The task is to check how many of these have the exact SessionName 'II-Anaphylaxsis'. 

Wait, but I should also check for possible variations. For example, sometimes the same session might be written with different spacing or punctuation. Let me go through each response one by one.

Respondent 1: SessionName is ""V (Hypoglycemia)"" – nope.
Respondent 3: ""III-Sepsis"" – not matching.
Respondent 13: ""I-VF"" – no.
Respondent 17: ""V (Hypoglycemia)"" – no.
Respondent 15: ""III - Sepsis"" – different.
Respondent 8: ""III (Sepsis)"" – nope.
Respondent 7: ""III-Sepsis"" – not it.
Respondent 12: ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" – close but the spelling is Anaphylaxis vs. Anaphylaxsis. Wait, the task says 'II-Anaphylaxsis' with two 's's. Let me check the exact spelling in the data.

Looking at respondent 23: Their SessionName is ""II-Anaphylaxsis"". That's a match. Also, respondent 5: ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" – note the space and hyphen. The task's target is 'II-Anaphylaxsis', but respondent 5's session has a space after the hyphen. Are these considered the same? The user might consider variations in formatting, but the exact match is needed unless specified otherwise. However, the task specifies the exact session name as 'II-Anaphylaxsis', so I need to check if the SessionName in the responses exactly matches that string.

Wait, looking at the data:

- Respondent 23: ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" (exact match)
- Respondent 5: ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" (with space and hyphen)
- Any others?

Wait, let me check all responses again:

Respondent 12: ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" – different spelling (Anaphylaxis vs. Anaphylaxsis) and format.

Respondent 5's SessionName is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" – the session name has a space after the hyphen. The task is looking for 'II-Anaphylaxsis' without the space. So, are these considered the same? The problem is whether the hyphen with or without space is considered the same session. Since the task specifies the exact name, I should count only exact matches. However, sometimes in data entry, hyphens and spaces can vary. Let me check the example given in the initial data.

In the example, the answer was 0 for a similar question. Let me see: in the example, the user asked for '2025-05-02' and 'Background (examination)' score 1. The answer was 0 because none of the respondents on that date had a score of 1. So, the example shows that exact matches are required.

Therefore, in this case, the exact SessionName must be 'II-Anaphylaxsis' as written. So, respondent 23's session is exactly ""II-Anaphylaxsis"". Respondent 5's is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" (with space), which is different. So, only respondent 23 matches. Wait, but let me check respondent 5 again. The SessionName is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" (with a space after the hyphen and before Anaphylaxsis). The task is looking for 'II-Anaphylaxsis' (no space). So, these are different. Therefore, only respondent 23 has the exact match. But wait, the task says 'II-Anaphylaxsis' – maybe the user made a typo, but according to the data, respondent 23's SessionName is ""II-Anaphylaxsis"", and respondent 5's is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"". So, only respondent 23 matches exactly. But wait, looking at the data again:

Wait, in the responses, respondent 5's SessionName is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" (with a space and hyphen), and respondent 23's is ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" (hyphen without space). So, the exact strings are different. Therefore, only respondent 23 would match the exact 'II-Anaphylaxsis' as per the task. But wait, the task's spelling is 'Anaphylaxsis' with two 's's. Let me check the data again. Respondent 23's SessionName is ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" (Anaphylaxsis with two 's's?), or is it a typo? Let me check the data again.

Looking at the data for respondent 23:

""SessionName"": ""II-Anaphylaxsis""

Yes, that's how it's written. The task is to count sessions named 'II-Anaphylaxsis', which matches respondent 23. Respondent 5's SessionName is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" (with a space and hyphen, but the spelling is Anaphylaxsis with two 's's? Wait, no. Wait, the task says 'II-Anaphylaxsis' (maybe a typo for Anaphylaxis?), but in the data, respondent 23's SessionName is ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" (Anaphylaxsis with double 's'), while respondent 5's is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" (Anaphylaxsis with double 's' as well). Wait, no, let me check the exact spelling.

Wait, the task is to count 'II-Anaphylaxsis'. Let me check the exact spelling in the data:

Respondent 23: ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" – that's the exact match.

Respondent 5: ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" – note the space after II and hyphen, but the session name is ""Anaphylaxsis"" (with two 's's). Wait, Anaphylaxsis is a misspelling of Anaphylaxis (which is the correct term). But in the data, both respondent 23 and 5 have ""Anaphylaxsis"" with two 's's. So, the SessionName for respondent 5 is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" (with space) and respondent 23 is ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" (without space). The task is looking for 'II-Anaphylaxsis' (without space). So, only respondent 23 matches exactly. However, sometimes session names might have variations in spacing or punctuation but refer to the same session. But according to the data schema, the SessionName is an open-ended question, so the exact string matters. Therefore, only respondent 23's SessionName exactly matches 'II-Anaphylaxsis'. 

Wait, but looking at respondent 5's data:

""SessionName"": ""II - Anaphylaxsis""

So, the hyphen is followed by a space. The task is looking for 'II-Anaphylaxsis' (hyphen without space). Therefore, these are two different strings. Hence, only respondent 23 would be counted. But wait, maybe the user intended to count all variations of 'II-Anaphylaxsis' regardless of spacing. But according to the example given, exact matches are required. For instance, in the example, the answer was 0 because none of the respondents on 2025-05-02 had a score of 1 in 'Background (examination)'. So, exact matches are necessary.

Therefore, in this case, only respondent 23 has the exact SessionName 'II-Anaphylaxsis'. Respondent 5's SessionName is 'II - Anaphylaxsis' (with space), which is different. So the count is 1. But wait, let me check again. Wait, respondent 5's SessionName is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" (with space), and the task is looking for 'II-Anaphylaxsis' (no space). So, these are different. Therefore, only respondent 23 is a match. So the answer is 1. But wait, let me check all responses again to make sure I didn't miss any.

Looking through all responses:

- Respondent 1: V (Hypoglycemia)
- 3: III-Sepsis
- 13: I-VF
- 17: V (Hypoglycemia)
- 15: III - Sepsis
- 8: III (Sepsis)
- 7: III-Sepsis
- 12: II (Anaphylaxis)
- 23: II-Anaphylaxsis
- 19: I - MI
- 5: II - Anaphylaxsis
- 18: IV - VT

So, only respondent 23 and 5 have 'Anaphylaxsis' in their SessionName. But respondent 5's is 'II - Anaphylaxsis' (with space), and 23's is 'II-Anaphylaxsis' (without space). The task is looking for 'II-Anaphylaxsis', so only 23 matches exactly. Therefore, the count is 1.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who participated in a 'II - Anaphylaxsis' session.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task. The user wants to count the respondents who participated in a session named 'II - Anaphylaxsis'. 

First, I need to look at the 'responses' array in the provided data. Each respondent has an 'answers' object that includes the 'SessionName' field. My job is to check each response's 'SessionName' and see if it matches exactly 'II - Anaphylaxsis'. 

Looking through the list:

1. Respondent 23: SessionName is ""II-Anaphylaxsis"". Hmm, the hyphen here is without spaces. The target is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" with spaces around the hyphen. So this might not match. But wait, maybe there's a typo? Let me check the exact spelling. The user specified 'Anaphylaxsis' with two 's's. The respondent's entry also has ""II-Anaphylaxsis"". The difference is the hyphen spacing. But the task is looking for 'II - Anaphylaxsis' with spaces. So this might not be a match. Or maybe the user considers variations. But according to strict matching, it's different.

2. Respondent 19: SessionName is ""I - MI"". Not relevant.

3. Respondent 10: ""(MI)-VT"". No.

4. Respondent 16: ""I - MI"". No.

5. Respondent 1: ""V (Hypoglycemia)"". No.

6. Respondent 12: ""II (Anaphylaxis)"". The name here is ""Anaphylaxis"" with one 's', so different spelling. So not a match.

7. Respondent 11: ""IV (AF)"". No.

8. Respondent 4: ""III (Sepsis)"". No.

9. Respondent 7: ""III-Sepsis"". No.

10. Respondent 21: ""I (Myocardial infarction)"". No.

11. Respondent 5: SessionName is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"". Here, the hyphen has spaces, and the spelling is ""Anaphylaxsis"" with two 's's. This matches exactly the target name. So this is a match.

12. Respondent 18: ""IV - VT"". No.

So, only respondent 5 has the exact SessionName ""II - Anaphylaxsis"". Wait, but let me check again. The user's task is to count sessions named 'II - Anaphylaxsis'. Let me check all responses again.

Looking at respondent 5's data: ""SessionName"": ""II - Anaphylaxsis"". Yes, that's exactly the name we're looking for. 

Another possible entry is respondent 23: ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" (no spaces around hyphen). But the task specifies 'II - Anaphylaxsis' with spaces. So that's a different string. Unless there's a typo in the data entry, but we have to go by exact match. So respondent 23's session name is ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" which is not the same as ""II - Anaphylaxsis"". Therefore, only respondent 5 matches.

Wait, but let me check again. Are there any other respondents with ""II - Anaphylaxsis""? Let's go through each response again:

- Respondent 5: ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" – matches exactly.
- Any others? Respondent 12 has ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" which is a different spelling (Anaphylaxis vs. Anaphylaxsis). So no.

So the count should be 1. But wait, the example given in the initial data had an answer of 0 for a similar question. Let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The example was looking for a score of 1 on a specific date, and the answer was 0. But in this case, the task is different. 

Yes, the answer here is 1, as only respondent 5 has the exact SessionName ""II - Anaphylaxsis"".

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who scored 3 on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task. I need to count the respondents who scored 3 on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)'. 

First, I'll look at the questions schema to confirm what 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' refers to. The rubric says it's scored from 0 to 3, where 3 means ""Clear comprehensive recommendation without questioning"".

Now, I'll go through each response in the data. Let's check each respondent's answers for the 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' value.

Respondent 8: Their answer is 2. Not a 3.
Respondent 2: Answer is 2. Not a 3.
Respondent 17: Answer is 3. That's one.
Respondent 23: Answer is 3. That's two.
Respondent 20: Answer is 2. Not a 3.
Respondent 22: Answer is 2. Not a 3.
Respondent 4: Answer is 2. Not a 3.
Respondent 14: Answer is 1. Not a 3.

So, respondents 17 and 23 have a score of 3. That makes a total of 2.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents from the 'II (Anaphylactic Shock)' session who scored 1 on 'Background (history)' and 2 on 'Situation'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents from the 'II (Anaphylactic Shock)' session who scored 1 on 'Background (history)' and 2 on 'Situation'. 

First, I need to go through each response in the dataset and check if they meet all three conditions: the session name is 'II (Anaphylactic Shock)', their 'Background (history)' score is 1, and their 'Situation' score is 2.

Looking at the responses list, there are 10 respondents. Let me check each one:

1. **Respondent 23**: SessionName is 'II-Anaphylaxsis'. That's similar but not exactly 'II (Anaphylactic Shock)', so this doesn't match. Also, their Background (history) is 2 and Situation is 3. So no.

2. **Respondent 16**: SessionName is 'I - MI'. Doesn't match. Background (history) is 3, Situation 3. Not relevant.

3. **Respondent 4**: SessionName is 'III (Sepsis)'. Not matching. Background (history) is 3, Situation 3. Nope.

4. **Respondent 5**: SessionName is 'II - Anaphylaxsis'. Close but not the exact name. Background (history) is 3, Situation 3. Doesn't fit.

5. **Respondent 1**: SessionName is 'V (Hypoglycemia)'. Not the right session. Background (history) is 2, Situation 2. Still not matching.

6. **Respondent 18**: SessionName is 'IV - VT'. Not matching. Background (history) is 2, Situation 3. No.

7. **Respondent 6**: SessionName is 'II (Anaphylactic Shock)'. That's a match. Now check the scores. Background (history) is 3, Situation is 2. Oh, Background (history) here is 3, but we need 1. So this doesn't meet the criteria.

8. **Respondent 14**: SessionName is 'IV-Hypoglycemia'. Not the right session. Background (history) is 2, Situation 3. No.

9. **Respondent 11**: SessionName is 'IV (AF)'. Not matching. Background (history) is 3, Situation 3. Doesn't apply.

10. **Respondent 8**: SessionName is 'III (Sepsis)'. Not the correct session. Background (history) is 3, Situation 3. No.

Wait, so the only respondent with SessionName 'II (Anaphylactic Shock)' is respondent 6. But their Background (history) is 3 and Situation is 2. The required scores are Background (history) 1 and Situation 2. So even though the session matches, the scores don't. Therefore, there are zero respondents that meet all three conditions.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who scored 0 on 'Background (history)' and whose 'Comments' contain the word 'Clear'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The goal is to count the respondents who scored 0 on 'Background (history)' and have the word 'Clear' in their 'Comments'. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The 'questions' section defines each field. 'Background (history)' uses a rubric where 0 means ""History is unstructured or non-relevant"". The 'Comments' field is open-ended, so I need to check if the text contains 'Clear' (case-insensitive, but the output should preserve the original case).

Now, looking at the 'responses' array. Each respondent has an 'answers' object. I need to iterate through each response and check two conditions:
1. The value of 'Background (history)' is exactly 0.
2. The 'Comments' field includes the word 'Clear' (case-sensitive? The output rules say to preserve capitalization, but the task says ""contain the word 'Clear'"". Since the example in the data has ""Clear communication"" with a capital C, maybe it's case-sensitive. So I should look for exact matches of 'Clear' in the comments.

Let's go through each respondent:

1. Respondent 21: Background (history) is 3. Comments mention ""Diagnostic clarity"" and ""Good...assessment"". 'Clarity' has 'clear' but not the exact word. So no.

2. Respondent 7: Background (history) is 2. Comments: ""Time..."". Doesn't meet either condition.

3. Respondent 10: Background (history) is 2. Comments: ""Time..."". No.

4. Respondent 11: Background (history) is 3. Comments: ""Clear communication..."". But score is 3, so no.

5. Respondent 23: Background (history) is 2. Comments mention ""Talking to registrav...DID: Sepsis..."". No 'Clear' here.

6. Respondent 2: Background (history) is 2. Comments empty. No.

7. Respondent 3: Background (history) is 3. Comments: ""The patient...Clear communication..."". Score is 3, so even though 'Clear' is present, the score isn't 0. So no.

8. Respondent 8: Background (history) is 3. Comments: ""Clear communication..."". Score 3. Doesn't meet.

9. Respondent 9: Background (history) is 2. Comments: ""Overall a bit unclear..."". 'unclear' is different. No.

10. Respondent 12: Background (history) is 3. Comments: ""Good"". No.

11. Respondent 14: Background (history) is 2. Comments: ""Late response..."". No.

12. Respondent 1: Background (history) is 2. Comments: ""Satisfactory"". No.

Wait, none of the respondents have a 'Background (history)' score of 0. Let me double-check each one:

Looking again at all responses:

- Respondent 3: Identification is 0, but Background (history) is 3.
- All others have Background (history) scores of 2, 3, or 2. No one has a 0. 

So even if someone had 'Clear' in comments, since no one scored 0 on Background (history), the count is 0.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 'Background (history)' is greater than 5.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents whose total score for 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 'Background (history)' is greater than 5. 

First, I need to make sure I understand the data structure. The 'responses' array contains each respondent's answers, and each answer includes various fields with scores. The relevant fields here are 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 'Background (history)'. 

Looking at the 'questions' section, 'Background (history)' has a rubric with scores from 0 to 3, and 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' also uses a rubric from 0 to 3. So each of these fields can contribute a maximum of 3 points. Adding them together, the maximum possible total would be 6. The question asks for a total greater than 5, which means the sum needs to be 6.

Now, I need to go through each respondent in the 'responses' array and calculate the sum of these two scores. Then check if the sum is greater than 5 (i.e., equals 6). Let's list them out one by one.

Starting with respondent 14:
- Background (history): 2
- Recommendation (global rating scale): 2
Sum: 2 + 2 = 4 → Not greater than 5.

Respondent 6:
- Background (history): 3
- Recommendation (global rating scale): 3
Sum: 3 + 3 = 6 → This meets the condition.

Respondent 2:
- Background (history): 2
- Recommendation (global rating scale): 1
Sum: 2 + 1 = 3 → No.

Respondent 13:
- Background (history): 2
- Recommendation (global rating scale): 2
Sum: 4 → No.

Respondent 16:
- Background (history): 3
- Recommendation (global rating scale): 3
Sum: 6 → Yes.

Respondent 22:
- Background (history): 3
- Recommendation (global rating scale): 3
Sum: 6 → Yes.

Respondent 10:
- Background (history): 2
- Recommendation (global rating scale): 2
Sum: 4 → No.

So, respondents 6, 16, and 22 have a total score of 6, which is greater than 5. That's three respondents. Wait, let me double-check each entry to make sure I didn't miss any.

Yes, respondent 6: 3+3=6, 16: 3+3=6, 22: 3+3=6. That's three in total. So the answer should be 3.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Background (history)' and 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is greater than 3.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents whose total score for 'Background (history)' and 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is greater than 3. 

First, I need to understand the data structure provided. The dataset has a 'questions' section that defines each field and their scoring rubrics. The 'responses' section contains individual respondents with their answers, including scores for each category.

Looking at the 'Background (history)' in the questions, the rubric is from 0 to 3. Similarly, 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' also uses a rubric from 0 to 3. The task is to sum these two scores for each respondent and count how many have a total greater than 3.

Now, I'll go through each respondent in the responses array and calculate their scores for these two fields. Let's list them out:

1. Respondent 1:
   - Background (history): 2
   - Recommendation (global rating scale): 2
   Sum: 2 + 2 = 4. This is greater than 3, so count this.

2. Respondent 10:
   - Background (history): 2
   - Recommendation (global rating scale): 2
   Sum: 2 + 2 = 4. Also greater than 3. Count.

3. Respondent 19:
   - Background (history): 3
   - Recommendation (global rating scale): 3
   Sum: 3 + 3 = 6. Definitely greater than 3. Count.

4. Respondent 20:
   - Background (history): 2
   - Recommendation (global rating scale): 3
   Sum: 2 + 3 = 5. Count.

5. Respondent 4:
   - Background (history): 3
   - Recommendation (global rating scale): 2
   Sum: 3 + 2 = 5. Count.

Wait, but let me double-check each entry to make sure I didn't misread any values. For example, respondent 20's Background (examination) is -1, but that's not relevant here. We're only looking at 'Background (history)' and 'Recommendation (global rating scale)'. All other fields don't matter for this calculation.

So, all five respondents have a sum of 4 or higher. Wait, but wait, the responses list has 5 entries. Let me recount each sum:

1. Respondent 1: 2 + 2 = 4 → yes.
2. Respondent 10: 2 + 2 = 4 → yes.
3. Respondent 19: 3 + 3 = 6 → yes.
4. Respondent 20: 2 + 3 = 5 → yes.
5. Respondent 4: 3 + 2 = 5 → yes.

So all five respondents meet the criteria. But wait, looking back at the data:

Wait, the responses array has 5 entries. Let me check each one again:

- Respondent 1: 2 (history) + 2 (GRS) = 4 → yes.
- Respondent 10: 2 + 2 = 4 → yes.
- Respondent 19: 3 + 3 = 6 → yes.
- Respondent 20: 2 (history) + 3 (GRS) = 5 → yes.
- Respondent 4: 3 (history) + 2 (GRS) = 5 → yes.

So all five respondents have a total greater than 3. But wait, the example given in the problem had an answer of 0, but that was for a different question. However, in this case, according to the data, all five respondents have sums greater than 3. But wait, let me check the data again to confirm.

Looking at each response:

1. Respondent 1: Background (history) is 2, GRS is 2. Sum 4.
2. Respondent 10: Both 2. Sum 4.
3. Respondent 19: Both 3. Sum 6.
4. Respondent 20: History 2, GRS 3. Sum 5.
5. Respondent 4: History 3, GRS 2. Sum 5.

Yes, all five. So the count should be 5. But wait, the example in the problem had a different scenario where the answer was 0, but that's a different question. So in this case, the answer is 5. But wait, let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in the data.

Wait, looking at the responses provided in the questionnaire:

The responses are:

1. Respondent 1: answers include Background (history): 2, GRS: 2 → sum 4.
2. Respondent 10: Background (history): 2, GRS: 2 → sum 4.
3. Respondent 19: Background (history): 3, GRS: 3 → sum 6.
4. Respondent 20: Background (history): 2, GRS: 3 → sum 5.
5. Respondent 4: Background (history): 3, GRS: 2 → sum 5.

So all five respondents have a sum greater than 3. Therefore, the count is 5. But wait, the example in the problem had a different question (count for date 2025-05-02 and score 1 on Background examination) and the answer was 0, which is correct for that case. But here, the answer should be 5. However, I need to make sure that there are no other respondents in the data. Let me check again the responses array. The responses array has 5 entries. So all five meet the criteria. Therefore, the answer is 5.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who scored 2 on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and whose 'Comments' contain the word 'communication'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The goal is to count the respondents who scored 2 on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and have the word 'communication' in their 'Comments'. 

First, I need to look at the 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' field. According to the questions schema, this field uses a rubric where 2 means ""Confident but required some further questioning"". So I need to find all responses where this field is exactly 2.

Next, the 'Comments' field is an open-ended text. I need to check each of those responses' comments for the presence of the word 'communication', case-insensitive. So even if it's 'Communication' with a capital C or part of another word like 'communications', but looking at the data examples, the comments seem to use the exact word. Wait, the task says ""contain the word 'communication'"", so I should look for any occurrence of that exact word, regardless of case. But in the data provided, the comments have entries like ""clear communication"" or ""communication skills"". So I need to check each comment for that substring.

Now, let's go through each response in the data:

1. Respondent 10: 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is 2. Comments: ""Time: (15:53-16:14)"" – no 'communication' here. So exclude.
2. Respondent 15: GRS is 2. Comments: ""Detailed Response - clear communication"" – here, 'communication' is present. So this counts.
3. Respondent 21: GRS is 3. Exclude.
4. Respondent 18: GRS is 2. Comments: ""Not very concise or clear communication..."" – 'communication' is present. Count this.
5. Respondent 17: GRS is 2. Comments: ""Concise - clear\nSatisfactory"" – no 'communication'. Exclude.
6. Respondent 16: GRS is 3. Exclude.
7. Respondent 5: GRS is 3. Exclude.
8. Respondent 22: GRS is 3. Exclude.
9. Respondent 19: GRS is 3. Exclude.
10. Respondent 4: GRS is 2. Comments: ""Clinical handover and communication skills, satisfactory..."" – 'communication' is present. Count this.

Wait, let me check each one again:

Looking at the responses list:

- Respondent 15: GRS 2, comments have ""clear communication"" – yes.
- Respondent 18: GRS 2, comments: ""Not very concise or clear communication"" – yes.
- Respondent 4: GRS 2, comments: ""Clinical handover and communication skills..."" – yes.

Wait, but in the data provided, let's check each response:

Looking at the 'responses' array:

1. Respondent 10: GRS 2, comments: ""Time: (15:53-16:14)"" – no.
2. Respondent 15: GRS 2, comments: ""Detailed Response - clear communication"" – yes.
3. Respondent 21: GRS 3 – no.
4. Respondent 18: GRS 2, comments: ""Not very concise or clear communication\nSatisfactory"" – yes.
5. Respondent 17: GRS 2? Wait, no. Respondent 17's GRS is 2? Let me check. The data for respondent 17: ""Recommendation (global rating scale)"": 2. Yes. Comments: ""Concise - clear\nSatisfactory"" – no 'communication' here. So that's GRS 2 but no 'communication' in comments. So exclude.
6. Respondent 16: GRS 3 – no.
7. Respondent 5: GRS 3 – no.
8. Respondent 22: GRS 3 – no.
9. Respondent 19: GRS 3 – no.
10. Respondent 4: GRS 2. Comments: ""Clinical handover and communication skills, satisfactory..."" – yes.

So respondents 15, 18, and 4 have GRS 2 and 'communication' in comments. That's three respondents. Wait, but let me check again:

Wait, respondent 4's GRS is 2? Let me check the data again. The response for respondent 4 is:

{
  ""respondent"": ""4"",
  ""answers"": {
    ...
    ""Recommendation (global rating scale)"": 2,
    ""Comments"": ""Clinical handover and communication skills, satisfactory\nNo panic, no arrest team\nSatisfactory""
  }
}

Yes, GRS is 2 and comments include 'communication'. So that's three respondents: 15, 18, 4.

Wait, but in the initial pass, I thought respondent 15, 18, and 4. So that's three. But let me check again:

Wait, the task is to count the number of respondents who meet both conditions. Let's list all responses where GRS is 2 and comments include 'communication':

- Respondent 15: GRS 2, comments have 'communication' – yes.
- Respondent 18: GRS 2, comments have 'communication' – yes.
- Respondent 4: GRS 2, comments have 'communication' – yes.

So that's three. But wait, looking back at the data:

Wait, respondent 17's GRS is 2, but their comments don't have 'communication'. So not counted.

So total of three respondents. But wait, let me check the data again to confirm.

Looking at the data provided in the questionnaire:

Responses list:

1. Respondent 10: GRS 2, comments no 'communication' – no.
2. Respondent 15: GRS 2, comments: ""Detailed Response - clear communication"" – yes.
3. Respondent 21: GRS 3 – no.
4. Respondent 18: GRS 2, comments: ""Not very concise or clear communication..."" – yes.
5. Respondent 17: GRS 2, comments: ""Concise - clear..."" – no.
6. Respondent 16: GRS 3 – no.
7. Respondent 5: GRS 3 – no.
8. Respondent 22: GRS 3 – no.
9. Respondent 19: GRS 3 – no.
10. Respondent 4: GRS 2, comments: ""Clinical handover and communication skills..."" – yes.

So that's three respondents: 15, 18, 4. Therefore, the count is 3.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Identification' and 'Assessment' is greater than 6.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents whose total score for 'Identification' and 'Assessment' is greater than 6. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The dataset has a 'questions' section that defines each field and a 'responses' array with each respondent's answers. 

Looking at the 'questions', 'Identification' and 'Assessment' are both rubric-based scores. The 'Identification' rubric goes from 0 to 3, and 'Assessment' also ranges from 0 to 3. So the maximum possible combined score would be 3 + 3 = 6. Wait, the task says to count those with a total greater than 6. But if the maximum is 6, how can someone have a total higher than that? Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the rubrics. Let me check the exact definitions.

For 'Identification': The rubric is 0 to 3. So each respondent's score here is between 0 and 3. For 'Assessment': Similarly, 0 to 3. Adding them together, the maximum possible is 6. The question asks for a total greater than 6, which would be impossible unless there's a mistake in the data. Wait, but maybe some respondents have scores that are higher than 3? Let me check the responses.

Looking at the responses array. Let's go through each respondent:

1. Respondent 11: Identification 3, Assessment 3. Total 6.
2. Respondent 6: Identification 3, Assessment 2. Total 5.
3. Respondent 15: Identification 3, Assessment 2. Total 5.
4. Respondent 9: Identification 3, Assessment 2. Total 5.
5. Respondent 22: Identification 3, Assessment 2. Total 5.
6. Respondent 1: Identification -1, Assessment 3. Total 2. (Wait, Identification is -1 here? But the rubric says 0-3. That's an invalid score. Maybe a data entry error. But according to the data, it's -1. So total is -1 +3=2.)
7. Respondent 23: Identification 3, Assessment 3. Total 6.
8. Respondent 10: Identification 2, Assessment 2. Total 4.

So none of the respondents have a total greater than 6. The highest possible is 6. Therefore, the count should be 0. 

But wait, the example given in the problem had an answer of 0 for a similar question. Maybe the task is designed to have 0 as the answer here as well. Let me confirm again. All respondents' Identification and Assessment scores sum to 6 or less. So the answer is 0.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents from the 'V (Hypoglycemia)' session who scored 0 on 'Identification' and 1 on 'Assessment'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents from the 'V (Hypoglycemia)' session who scored 0 on 'Identification' and 1 on 'Assessment'. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The data has a 'responses' array where each respondent has an 'answers' object containing their scores for various questions. The 'SessionName' field will tell me which session the respondent was part of. 

So, the first step is to filter all responses where the 'SessionName' is exactly 'V (Hypoglycemia)'. Let me look through each response in the 'responses' array.

Looking at the responses:

- Respondent 17: Their SessionName is ""V (Hypoglycemia)"". That's a match. Now check their 'Identification' and 'Assessment' scores. Identification is 3, Assessment is 3. Doesn't meet the criteria of 0 and 1.

Other respondents: Let's check others. For example, respondent 14 has SessionName ""IV-Hypoglycemia"", which is different. Respondent 7 is ""III-Sepsis"", etc. No other respondents have the exact 'V (Hypoglycemia)' session name.

So, only respondent 17 is in the 'V (Hypoglycemia)' session. But their scores for Identification and Assessment are 3 and 3, not 0 and 1. Therefore, there are no respondents that meet all the criteria. The count should be 0.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents from the 'IV (AF)' session who scored 0 on 'Background (examination)' and 2 on 'Identification'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents from the 'IV (AF)' session who scored 0 on 'Background (examination)' and 2 on 'Identification'. 

First, I need to look through the responses and filter them based on the given criteria. Let's start by identifying which responses are part of the 'IV (AF)' session. 

Looking at the 'responses' array, each respondent has a 'SessionName' in their answers. The session we're interested in is 'IV (AF)'. Scanning through the list:

- Respondent 5: SessionName is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" – not a match.
- Respondent 16: ""I - MI"" – nope.
- Respondent 11: ""IV (AF)"" – this is a match.
- Respondent 8: ""III (Sepsis)"" – no.
- Respondent 1: ""V (Hypoglycemia)"" – no.
- Respondent 9: ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"" – no.
- Respondent 13: ""I-VF"" – not the same.
- Respondent 20: ""IV (VT)"" – different.
- Respondent 22: ""IV (VT)"" – also different.

So only respondent 11 is in the 'IV (AF)' session. Now, check their scores for 'Background (examination)' and 'Identification'. 

Looking at respondent 11's answers:
- 'Background (examination)': 3
- 'Identification': 3

The required scores are 0 for 'Background (examination)' and 2 for 'Identification'. Respondent 11's scores don't meet either of these. 

Are there any other respondents in 'IV (AF)'? From the data provided, no. Therefore, there are zero respondents that meet all the specified criteria.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents from the 'II-Anaphylaxsis' session who scored 0 on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 2 on 'Situation'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The goal is to count the respondents from the 'II-Anaphylaxsis' session who scored 0 on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 2 on 'Situation'. 

First, I need to look through the responses and filter them based on the criteria. Let's start by identifying all responses where the SessionName is exactly 'II-Anaphylaxsis'. 

Looking at the responses array, I check each entry's SessionName. The respondent with ID 23 has SessionName ""II-Anaphylaxsis"". Another respondent, ID 9, has ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"" which is similar but not exactly the same. The task specifies 'II-Anaphylaxsis' without parentheses, so maybe that's a different session name. Wait, but sometimes session names might have variations. However, the exact match is crucial here. So only respondent 23 has the exact SessionName ""II-Anaphylaxsis"".

Next, for respondent 23, check their scores. The 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' should be 0. Looking at their answers, the global rating scale is 3. So that's not a match. 

Wait, but maybe I missed other respondents. Let me check again. The responses are:

- Respondent 23: SessionName ""II-Anaphylaxsis"", 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is 3, 'Situation' is 3. So both criteria are not met.

- Respondent 9: SessionName ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"", which is similar but the name is in parentheses. If the task is strict about the exact session name, then this might not count. But perhaps the session name is considered the same despite formatting. However, the task specifies 'II-Anaphylaxsis' exactly, so respondent 9's session name is different. 

So, no respondents in the 'II-Anaphylaxsis' session. Wait, but maybe there's a typo? Let me check all responses again.

Looking through all responses:

- Respondent 10: SessionName ""(MI)-VT""

- Respondent 11: ""IV (AF)""

- Respondent 19: ""I - MI""

- Respondent 21: ""I (Myocardial infarction)""

- Respondent 1: ""V (Hypoglycemia)""

- Respondent 9: ""II (Anaphylaxsis)""

- Respondent 12: ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" (note the correct spelling of Anaphylaxis)

- Respondent 8: ""III (Sepsis)""

- Respondent 20: ""IV (VT)""

- Respondent 23: ""II-Anaphylaxsis""

So only respondent 23 has ""II-Anaphylaxsis"". Now, check their scores. 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is 3, and 'Situation' is 3. So they don't meet the criteria of 0 and 2. 

Are there any other respondents with SessionName variations that might be considered? For example, respondent 9's session is ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"" which is similar but has parentheses. If the task allows for slight variations, but the question specifies 'II-Anaphylaxsis' exactly, then no. 

Additionally, check if any other respondents have 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' as 0 and 'Situation' as 2. Let's scan all responses:

Looking at each response:

- Respondent 11: global rating 3, Situation 3.

- Respondent 10: global 2, Situation 2.

- Respondent 19: global 3, Situation 3.

- Respondent 21: global 3, Situation 2.

- Respondent 1: global 2, Situation 2.

- Respondent 9: global 2, Situation 3.

- Respondent 12: global 3, Situation 3.

- Respondent 8: global 3, Situation 3.

- Respondent 20: global 3, Situation 3.

- Respondent 23: global 3, Situation 3.

So, looking for 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' = 0. None of the respondents have that. The lowest is 2 (respondent 10, 1, 9). So even if we consider other sessions, there's no one with 0 on global rating. Therefore, the count is 0.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents from the 'IV (VT)' session who scored 1 on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 0 on 'Background (examination)'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents from the 'IV (VT)' session who scored 1 on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 0 on 'Background (examination)'. 

First, I need to go through each response in the provided data and check if they meet all three conditions: 
1. Their SessionName is 'IV (VT)'.
2. Their 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' score is 1.
3. Their 'Background (examination)' score is 0.

Looking at the responses array:

1. Respondent 15: SessionName is ""III - Sepsis"". Doesn't match. Skip.
2. Respondent 10: SessionName is ""(MI)-VT"". Not 'IV (VT)'. Skip.
3. Respondent 6: SessionName is ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"". Nope.
4. Respondent 13: SessionName is ""I-VF"". Not matching.
5. Respondent 17: SessionName is ""V (Hypoglycemia)"". No.
6. Respondent 22: SessionName is ""IV (VT)"". Let's check the scores. 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is 3, and 'Background (examination)' is 3. Doesn't meet the required scores.
7. Respondent 4: SessionName is ""III (Sepsis)"". Not the right session.
8. Respondent 18: SessionName is ""IV - VT"". Wait, the session name here is written as ""IV - VT"" with a hyphen and space. The task specifies 'IV (VT)'. Are these considered the same? The data has variations like ""IV (VT)"" and ""IV - VT"". But the exact match is needed unless specified otherwise. Since the task says 'IV (VT)', I should check for exact matches. So respondent 18's session is ""IV - VT"", which is different. So they don't qualify.

So, among all responses, only respondent 22 has SessionName ""IV (VT)"", but their scores are 3 and 3. No one else matches the session name exactly. Therefore, there are 0 respondents that meet all three criteria.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Assessment' and 'Identification' is greater than 6.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents whose total score for 'Assessment' and 'Identification' is greater than 6. 

First, I need to understand the structure of the data provided. The dataset has a 'questions' section that defines each field and a 'responses' array containing each respondent's answers. 

Looking at the 'questions' schema, both 'Assessment' and 'Identification' are rubric-based scores. The 'Identification' field has a rubric from 0 to 3, and 'Assessment' also ranges from 0 to 3. The maximum possible combined score for these two would be 3 + 3 = 6. Wait, the task says to count respondents where the total is greater than 6. But if each can only go up to 3, the maximum total is 6. So a total greater than 6 isn't possible. That seems odd. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the question?

Wait, let me double-check. The 'Assessment' rubric is 0-3, and 'Identification' is also 0-3. Adding them together, the highest possible sum is 6. So if the question is asking for a total greater than 6, that would mean no respondents meet that criteria. But maybe there's a mistake in the question? Or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, looking back at the example provided in the initial part. The example question was about counting respondents on a specific date with a score of 1 on 'Background (examination)', and the answer was 0. That's because in the data, the only respondent on that date had a -1, which isn't 1. So maybe in this case, the answer is also 0 because the maximum possible is 6, so no one can have a total over 6. 

But let me check each respondent's 'Assessment' and 'Identification' scores to be sure. Let's go through each response:

1. Respondent 20: Identification=3, Assessment=3 → 3+3=6 → not >6.
2. Respondent 8: Identification=3, Assessment=2 → 5 → no.
3. Respondent 22: Identification=3, Assessment=2 → 5 → no.
4. Respondent 5: Identification=3, Assessment=3 → 6 → no.
5. Respondent 16: Identification=3, Assessment=3 → 6 → no.
6. Respondent 23: Identification=3, Assessment=3 → 6 → no.
7. Respondent 15: Identification=3, Assessment=2 → 5 → no.
8. Respondent 12: Identification=3, Assessment=2 → 5 → no.
9. Respondent 7: Identification=3, Assessment=2 → 5 → no.
10. Respondent 19: Identification=3, Assessment=2 → 5 → no.

All respondents have a combined score of 6 or less. Therefore, none have a total greater than 6. The answer should be 0.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Identification' and 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is greater than 5.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents whose total score for 'Identification' and 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is greater than 5. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The 'responses' array contains each respondent's answers. Each answer includes various fields, including 'Identification' and 'Recommendation (global rating scale)'. Both of these are scored on a rubric. 

Looking at the 'questions' section, the 'Identification' rubric ranges from 0 to 3. Similarly, 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' also uses a rubric from 0 to 3. So the maximum possible combined score for these two would be 3 + 3 = 6. The question asks for a total greater than 5, which means the sum needs to be 6.

Now, I need to go through each respondent in the 'responses' array and check if the sum of their 'Identification' and 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' scores is greater than 5 (i.e., equals 6).

Let's list out each respondent and their scores:

1. Respondent 16:
   - Identification: 3
   - Recommendation (global rating scale): 3
   - Sum: 3 + 3 = 6 → meets the condition.

2. Respondent 18:
   - Identification: 3
   - GRS: 2
   - Sum: 5 → doesn't meet.

3. Respondent 7:
   - Identification: 3
   - GRS: 2
   - Sum: 5 → no.

4. Respondent 8:
   - Identification: 3
   - GRS: 3
   - Sum: 6 → yes.

5. Respondent 3:
   - Identification: 0
   - GRS: 3
   - Sum: 3 → no.

6. Respondent 17:
   - Identification: 3
   - GRS: 2
   - Sum: 5 → no.

7. Respondent 15:
   - Identification: 3
   - GRS: 2
   - Sum: 5 → no.

8. Respondent 12:
   - Identification: 3
   - GRS: 3
   - Sum: 6 → yes.

9. Respondent 2:
   - Identification: 3
   - GRS: 1
   - Sum: 4 → no.

10. Respondent 10:
    - Identification: 2
    - GRS: 2
    - Sum: 4 → no.

11. Respondent 22:
    - Identification: 3
    - GRS: 3
    - Sum: 6 → yes.

12. Respondent 1:
    - Identification: -1 (Wait, this is -1. But the rubric for Identification is 0-3. Maybe a typo? But according to the data, it's -1. So sum with GRS 2: -1 +2=1 → no.)

Now, the respondents who meet the condition (sum >5) are 16, 8, 12, 22. That's four respondents. Let me double-check each:

- 16: 3+3=6 ✅
- 8: 3+3=6 ✅
- 12:3+3=6 ✅
- 22:3+3=6 ✅

Yes, four respondents. So the answer should be 4.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who scored 3 on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and whose 'Comments' contain the word 'Overall'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The goal is to count the respondents who scored 3 on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and have the word 'Overall' in their 'Comments'. 

First, I need to look at the 'responses' array in the provided data. Each respondent has an 'answers' object that includes various fields. The two key fields here are 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and 'Comments'.

Starting with the 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)': I need to check each respondent's score here. The task specifies a score of 3. So, I'll go through each response and note which ones have a 3 in that field.

Next, the 'Comments' field needs to contain the word 'Overall'. This is a case-sensitive check, so I'll look for the exact substring 'Overall' in the comments. Even if the comment is in lowercase or has other variations, but according to the output rules, I should preserve capitalization. However, the task says ""contain the word 'Overall'"", so I need to check if 'Overall' appears exactly as written.

Now, let's go through each response one by one:

1. Respondent 17: 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' is 3. Comments: ""Concise - clear\nSatisfactory"". No 'Overall' here.
2. Respondent 7: Score 2. Doesn't meet the score requirement.
3. Respondent 19: Score 3. Comments mention ""Wrong CPR position..."". No 'Overall'.
4. Respondent 18: Score 2. Not applicable.
5. Respondent 5: Score 2. Doesn't qualify.
6. Respondent 6: Score 2. Nope.
7. Respondent 11: Score 3. Comments: ""Clear communication and handover"". No 'Overall'.
8. Respondent 15: Score 2. Not applicable.
9. Respondent 2: Score 2. Doesn't meet.
10. Respondent 23: Score 3. Comments: Mentions ""Time: ..."" and other notes, but no 'Overall'.
11. Respondent 4: Score 2. Not relevant.
12. Respondent 12: Score 3. Comments: ""Good"". No 'Overall'.

Looking through all responses, none of the respondents who scored 3 in 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' have 'Overall' in their comments. Therefore, the count should be 0.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents from the 'I - MI' session who scored 0 on 'Identification' and 2 on 'Situation'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents from the 'I - MI' session who scored 0 on 'Identification' and 2 on 'Situation'. 

First, I need to go through each response in the provided data and check if they meet all three conditions: 
1. The session name is 'I - MI'.
2. The 'Identification' score is 0.
3. The 'Situation' score is 2.

Looking at the responses array, there are 12 respondents. Let's check each one:

1. Respondent 16: SessionName is ""I - MI"". Identification is 3, Situation is 3. Doesn't meet the criteria.
2. Respondent 3: SessionName is ""III-Sepsis"". Different session, so skip.
3. Respondent 17: SessionName is ""V (Hypoglycemia)"". Not relevant.
4. Respondent 15: SessionName is ""III - Sepsis"". Not the right session.
5. Respondent 2: SessionName is ""MI"". The session name here is just ""MI"", not ""I - MI"". So this might be a different session. Need to check if ""MI"" is considered the same as ""I - MI"". But according to the data, the session names are specific. For example, respondent 1 has ""V (Hypoglycemia)"" and others have different formats. Since the task specifies 'I - MI', exact match is needed. So respondent 2's session is ""MI"", which doesn't match ""I - MI"".
6. Respondent 20: SessionName is ""IV (VT)"". Not relevant.
7. Respondent 5: SessionName is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"". Not matching.
8. Respondent 14: SessionName is ""IV-Hypoglycemia"". No.
9. Respondent 8: SessionName is ""III (Sepsis)"". No.
10. Respondent 10: SessionName is ""(MI)-VT"". Different format.
11. Respondent 1: SessionName is ""V (Hypoglycemia)"". No.
12. Respondent 9: SessionName is ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"". No.

So, only respondent 16 is in the 'I - MI' session. But their Identification is 3 and Situation is 3, which doesn't meet the required scores. 

Wait, maybe I missed someone. Let me check again. The session name 'I - MI' appears only in respondent 16. All others have different session names. Therefore, there are no respondents in the 'I - MI' session with Identification 0 and Situation 2. The count should be 0.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Situation' and 'Background (history)' is greater than 3.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents whose total score for 'Situation' and 'Background (history)' is greater than 3. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The dataset has a 'questions' section that defines each field and a 'responses' array containing each respondent's answers. 

Looking at the 'questions' schema, 'Situation' and 'Background (history)' are both rubric-based scores. The 'Situation' rubric ranges from 0 to 3, and 'Background (history)' also ranges from 0 to 3. So the maximum combined score for these two would be 6 (3+3), and the minimum is 0 (0+0). The task is to find respondents where the sum of these two scores is greater than 3.

Now, I need to go through each respondent in the 'responses' array and calculate the sum of their 'Situation' and 'Background (history)' scores. Then, check if that sum is greater than 3. If it is, count that respondent.

Let's start with the first respondent (respondent 22). Their 'Situation' is 3 and 'Background (history)' is 3. Sum is 6, which is greater than 3. So count this one.

Next, respondent 10: 'Situation' is 2, 'Background (history)' is 2. Sum is 4. That's greater than 3. Count.

Respondent 1: 'Situation' 2, 'Background (history)' 2. Sum 4. Count.

Respondent 13: 'Situation' 3, 'Background (history)' 2. Sum 5. Count.

Respondent 9: 'Situation' 3, 'Background (history)' 2. Sum 5. Count.

Respondent 21: 'Situation' 2, 'Background (history)' 3. Sum 5. Count.

Respondent 7: 'Situation' 3, 'Background (history)' 2. Sum 5. Count.

Respondent 3: 'Situation' 2, 'Background (history)' 3. Sum 5. Count.

Respondent 18: 'Situation' 3, 'Background (history)' 2. Sum 5. Count.

Respondent 17: 'Situation' 3, 'Background (history)' 3. Sum 6. Count.

Respondent 6: 'Situation' 2, 'Background (history)' 3. Sum 5. Count.

Wait, let me check each one again to make sure I didn't miss any:

1. Respondent 22: 3+3=6 ✅
2. Respondent 10: 2+2=4 ✅
3. Respondent 1: 2+2=4 ✅
4. Respondent 13: 3+2=5 ✅
5. Respondent 9: 3+2=5 ✅
6. Respondent 21: 2+3=5 ✅
7. Respondent 7: 3+2=5 ✅
8. Respondent 3: 2+3=5 ✅
9. Respondent 18: 3+2=5 ✅
10. Respondent 17: 3+3=6 ✅
11. Respondent 6: 2+3=5 ✅

So all 11 respondents except none? Wait, wait. Let me check each response again to confirm their scores.

Looking back:

- Respondent 22: 3 and 3 → sum 6
- 10: 2 and 2 → 4
- 1: 2 and 2 → 4
- 13: 3 and 2 →5
- 9:3 and 2 →5
- 21:2 and 3 →5
- 7:3 and 2 →5
- 3:2 and 3 →5
- 18:3 and 2 →5
- 17:3 and 3 →6
- 6:2 and 3 →5

So all 11 respondents have sums of 4,5, or 6, which are all greater than 3. Wait, but that can't be right. Wait, the sum is greater than 3, so 4 and above. Let me check each:

Each of the 11 respondents:

1. 22: 6 >3 → yes
2. 10:4>3 → yes
3. 1:4>3 → yes
4. 13:5>3 → yes
5. 9:5>3 → yes
6. 21:5>3 → yes
7.7:5>3 → yes
8.3:5>3 → yes
9.18:5>3 → yes
10.17:6>3 → yes
11.6:5>3 → yes

So all 11 respondents meet the condition. But looking at the data, is there any respondent where the sum is 3 or less?

Wait, let's check again. For example, respondent 3: 'Situation' is 2, 'Background (history)' is 3. Sum is 5. Yes. What about respondent 6: 2+3=5. All others have sums of 4,5,6. So there's no one with sum ≤3. Therefore, all 11 respondents should be counted. But wait, the example given in the problem had an answer of 0. Wait, no, the example was a different question. The example was about a specific date and a score of 1 on a different field. So in this case, the answer would be 11. But let me check again.

Wait, the data has 11 responses. Let me count again:

1. 22: sum 6
2. 10:4
3.1:4
4.13:5
5.9:5
6.21:5
7.7:5
8.3:5
9.18:5
10.17:6
11.6:5

Total 11 respondents. All have sums greater than 3. So the answer should be 11. But wait, let me check if any of the responses have a sum ≤3. For example, is there any respondent with 'Situation' 0 and 'Background (history)' 0? Let's check each:

Looking through each response:

- Respondent 3: 'Situation' 2, 'Background (history)' 3 → sum 5
- Respondent 13: 'Situation' 3, 'Background (history)' 2 → sum 5
- Respondent 21: 'Situation' 2, 'Background (history)' 3 → sum 5
- Respondent 6: 'Situation' 2, 'Background (history)' 3 → sum 5
- Respondent 1: 'Situation' 2, 'Background (history)' 2 → sum 4
- Respondent 10: 'Situation' 2, 'Background (history)' 2 → sum 4
- The rest have higher sums.

So no one has a sum of 3 or less. All 11 respondents have sums of 4 or higher. Therefore, the count is 11.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose 'Identification' is higher than the average 'Identification' for all sessions on the same date.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents whose 'Identification' score is higher than the average 'Identification' for all sessions on the same date. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The data has a 'responses' array where each respondent has an 'answers' object containing various fields, including 'Date' and 'Identification'. The 'Identification' is a rubric-based score from 0 to 3. 

The plan is to:
1. Group all responses by their 'Date' to calculate the average 'Identification' for each date.
2. For each respondent, compare their 'Identification' score to the average of their respective date group.
3. Count how many respondents have a score higher than their group's average.

Let's start by extracting all the responses and their dates and Identification scores. 

Looking at the responses:
- Respondent 18: Date 2025-05-04, Identification 3
- Respondent 2: 2025-04-04, 3
- Respondent 3: 2025-04-04, 0
- Respondent 16: 2025-05-02, 3
- Respondent 22: 2025-05-16, 3
- Respondent 10: 2025-03-14, 2
- Respondent 14: 2025-03-14, 3
- Respondent 6: 2025-04-04, 3

Now, group by date:

2025-03-14: Respondents 10 (2), 14 (3) → Average = (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5
2025-04-04: Respondents 2 (3), 3 (0), 6 (3) → Average = (3 + 0 + 3)/3 = 2
2025-05-02: Respondent 16 (3) → Average = 3
2025-05-04: Respondent 18 (3) → Average =3
2025-05-16: Respondent 22 (3) → Average =3

Next, compare each respondent's score to their date's average:

- 2025-03-14:
  - Respondent 10: 2 < 2.5 → No
  - Respondent 14: 3 > 2.5 → Yes
- 2025-04-04:
  - Respondent 2: 3 > 2 → Yes
  - Respondent 3: 0 < 2 → No
  - Respondent 6: 3 > 2 → Yes
- 2025-05-02: 3 vs 3 → Equal → No
- 2025-05-04: 3 vs 3 → Equal → No
- 2025-05-16: 3 vs 3 → Equal → No

So the respondents with scores higher than the average are 14, 2, and 6. That's 3 respondents. Wait, let me check again.

Wait, for 2025-04-04, the average is 2. So respondents 2 and 6 have 3, which is higher. Respondent 3 has 0. So two in that group. Then 2025-03-14 has one (respondent 14). So total of 3 respondents. 

But let me recount:

Respondent 14: Yes (1)
Respondent 2: Yes (2)
Respondent 6: Yes (3)
Others: No. So total 3. 

Therefore, the answer should be 3.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score across all rubric items is below the average total score for all sessions.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the number of respondents whose total score across all rubric items is below the average total score for all sessions. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The dataset has a 'questions' section that defines each rubric item and a 'responses' array containing each respondent's answers. The rubric items are the ones with numerical scores (0-3), so I need to identify which fields those are.

Looking at the 'questions' schema, the following fields use a rubric (0-3):
- Identification
- Situation
- Background (history)
- Background (examination)
- Assessment
- Recommendation (clear recommendation)
- Recommendation (global rating scale)

The other fields like Date, SessionName, and Comments are open-ended and don't contribute to the score. So, for each respondent, I need to sum the scores from these seven rubric items.

Next, I'll go through each response in the 'responses' array and calculate their total scores. Let's list them out:

1. Respondent 21:
   - Identification: 3
   - Situation: 2
   - Background (history): 3
   - Background (examination): 1
   - Assessment: 2
   - Recommendation (clear recommendation): 3
   - Recommendation (global rating scale): 3
   Total: 3+2+3+1+2+3+3 = 17

2. Respondent 23:
   - All rubric scores are 3 except Background (history)=2 and Background (examination)=2.
   Total: 3+3+2+2+3+3+3 = 19

3. Respondent 14:
   - Identification:3, Situation:3, Background (history):2, Background (examination):2, Assessment:3, Recommendation (clear recommendation):1, GRS:2
   Total: 3+3+2+2+3+1+2 = 16

4. Respondent 12:
   - All 3s except Assessment=2.
   Total: 3+3+3+3+2+3+3 = 20

5. Respondent 13:
   - Background (history)=2, Background (examination)=1, Assessment=2, Recommendation (clear recommendation)=2, GRS=2. Others are 3.
   Total: 3+3+2+1+2+2+2 = 15

6. Respondent 15:
   - Background (history)=2, Background (examination)=3, Assessment=2, Recommendation (clear recommendation)=2, GRS=2. Others 3.
   Total: 3+3+2+3+2+2+2 = 17

7. Respondent 19:
   - All 3s except Assessment=2.
   Total: 3+3+3+3+2+3+3 = 20

8. Respondent 17:
   - All 3s except GRS=2.
   Total: 3+3+3+3+3+3+2 = 20

9. Respondent 2:
   - Background (history)=2, Background (examination)=3, Recommendation (clear recommendation)=2, GRS=1. Others 3.
   Total: 3+3+2+3+3+2+1 = 17

Now, let's list all the totals:
- 21:17, 23:19, 14:16, 12:20, 13:15, 15:17, 19:20, 17:20, 2:17

Next, calculate the average total score. Sum all totals and divide by the number of respondents (9).

Sum = 17+19+16+20+15+17+20+20+17 = 161
Average = 161 / 9 ≈ 17.89

Now, find which respondents have a total below 17.89. Looking at the totals:
- 17 (respondents 21, 15, 2)
- 16 (respondent 14)
- 15 (respondent 13)

So, respondents 21, 14, 13, 15, 2 have totals 17,16,15,17,17. Wait, 17 is below 17.89? Yes, because 17.89 is approximately 17.89, so 17 is below. Similarly, 16 and 15 are below. 

Wait, let me check the exact average. 161 divided by 9 is 17.888..., so approximately 17.89. So any total less than 17.89 would be 17 and below. 

Looking at the totals:
- 15 (13)
- 16 (14)
- 17 (21,15,2)
- 19 (23)
- 20 (12,19,17)

So the respondents with total below average (17.89) are 13,14,15,21,2. That's 5 respondents. Wait, but let me recount:

Respondent 13:15 (below)
14:16 (below)
21:17 (17 <17.89? Yes)
15:17 (yes)
2:17 (yes)
So that's 5 respondents. Wait, but the sum of their totals: 15+16+17+17+17 = 82. The other four have 19,20,20,20. 19+20+20+20=79. Wait, 82+79=161, which matches. So 5 respondents below average.

Wait, but the initial calculation of the average is 17.89. So any total less than that is below. So 17 is less than 17.89. Therefore, respondents with 15,16,17 are below. 

Looking at the list:

- 13:15
- 14:16
- 21:17
- 15:17
- 2:17

That's five respondents. So the answer should be 5. But let me check each total again to be sure.

Wait, respondent 15's total: 3 (Identification) +3 (Situation) +2 (Background history) +3 (examination) +2 (Assessment) +2 (Recommendation) +2 (GRS) = 3+3=6, +2=8, +3=11, +2=13, +2=15, +2=17. Yes, 17.

Respondent 2: 3+3+2+3+3+2+1= 3+3=6, +2=8, +3=11, +3=14, +2=16, +1=17. Correct.

So total of 5 respondents. But wait, the example given in the problem had an answer of 0. But that's a different question. So in this case, the answer is 5. But let me check again.

Wait, the example was about counting respondents on a specific date with a specific score. The current task is different. So the answer here is 5. But let me verify once more.

Total scores:

Respondent 21:17

23:19

14:16

12:20

13:15

15:17

19:20

17:20

2:17

So the totals are: 17,19,16,20,15,17,20,20,17.

Average is 161/9 ≈17.89.

Scores below 17.89 are 15,16,17. So how many respondents have scores <=17?

15:1 (respondent 13)

16:1 (14)

17:3 (21,15,2)

Total: 1+1+3=5.

Yes, so the answer is 5.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose 'Background (examination)' score is equal to the average 'Background (examination)' score for all sessions that occurred on the same date.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the number of respondents whose 'Background (examination)' score is equal to the average 'Background (examination)' score for all sessions that occurred on the same date. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The dataset has a 'responses' array where each respondent has an 'answers' object containing various fields, including 'Date' and 'Background (examination)'. The 'Date' field tells me when the session took place, and 'Background (examination)' is a numerical score based on the rubric provided.

The plan is as follows:

1. **Calculate the average 'Background (examination)' score for each date.**
   - For each unique date in the responses, compute the average of all 'Background (examination)' scores from respondents on that date.

2. **For each respondent, compare their 'Background (examination)' score to the average of their session's date.**
   - If their score matches the average for their date, count them.

3. **Sum all such respondents to get the final count.**

Let's start by extracting all the dates and their corresponding 'Background (examination)' scores. Then, compute the average for each date. After that, check each respondent against their date's average.

Looking at the responses:

- Respondent 5: Date 2025-05-04, score 3
- Respondent 21: 2025-05-16, score 1
- Respondent 12: 2025-05-02, score 3
- Respondent 4: 2025-05-16, score 2
- Respondent 6: 2025-04-04, score 3
- Respondent 18: 2025-05-04, score 2
- Respondent 13: 2025-03-14, score 1
- Respondent 23: 2025-03-14, score 2
- Respondent 22: 2025-05-16, score 3
- Respondent 20: 2025-05-02, score -1
- Respondent 1: 2025-05-02, score 2
- Respondent 17: 2025-05-04, score 3

Now, group the scores by date:

- **2025-05-04**: Scores are 3 (R5), 2 (R18), 3 (R17) → sum 8, count 3 → average ≈ 8/3 ≈ 2.666...
- **2025-05-16**: Scores are 1 (R21), 2 (R4), 3 (R22) → sum 6, count 3 → average 2
- **2025-05-02**: Scores are 3 (R12), -1 (R20), 2 (R1) → sum 4, count 3 → average ≈ 1.333...
- **2025-04-04**: Score 3 (R6) → average 3
- **2025-03-14**: Scores 1 (R13), 2 (R23) → sum 3, count 2 → average 1.5

Next, for each respondent, check if their score equals the average of their date:

- **R5 (2025-05-04, 3)**: Average is ~2.67 → 3 ≠ 2.67 → No
- **R21 (2025-05-16, 1)**: Average 2 → 1 ≠ 2 → No
- **R12 (2025-05-02, 3)**: Average ~1.33 → 3 ≠ 1.33 → No
- **R4 (2025-05-16, 2)**: Average 2 → 2 = 2 → Yes
- **R6 (2025-04-04, 3)**: Average 3 → 3 = 3 → Yes
- **R18 (2025-05-04, 2)**: Average ~2.67 → 2 ≠ 2.67 → No
- **R13 (2025-03-14, 1)**: Average 1.5 → 1 ≠ 1.5 → No
- **R23 (2025-03-14, 2)**: Average 1.5 → 2 ≠ 1.5 → No
- **R22 (2025-05-16, 3)**: Average 2 → 3 ≠ 2 → No
- **R20 (2025-05-02, -1)**: Average ~1.33 → -1 ≠ 1.33 → No
- **R1 (2025-05-02, 2)**: Average ~1.33 → 2 ≠ 1.33 → No
- **R17 (2025-05-04, 3)**: Average ~2.67 → 3 ≠ 2.67 → No

So, the respondents who meet the condition are R4 and R6. That's a total of 2 respondents.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who participated in a session where the average 'Assessment' for that session name is greater than 1.5.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents who participated in a session where the average 'Assessment' score for that session name is greater than 1.5. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The data has responses from multiple respondents, each with various scores, including the 'Assessment' score. Each response is part of a session with a specific 'SessionName'. The goal is to group responses by their session name, calculate the average 'Assessment' score for each session, and then count how many respondents are in sessions where this average exceeds 1.5.

Let me start by listing all the responses and their corresponding 'SessionName' and 'Assessment' scores. 

Looking at the responses:

1. Respondent 15: SessionName ""III - Sepsis"", Assessment 2
2. Respondent 22: SessionName ""IV (VT)"", Assessment 2
3. Respondent 18: SessionName ""IV - VT"", Assessment 3
4. Respondent 14: SessionName ""IV-Hypoglycemia"", Assessment 3
5. Respondent 21: SessionName ""I (Myocardial infarction)"", Assessment 2
6. Respondent 13: SessionName ""I-VF"", Assessment 2
7. Respondent 8: SessionName ""III (Sepsis)"", Assessment 2
8. Respondent 17: SessionName ""V (Hypoglycemia)"", Assessment 3
9. Respondent 16: SessionName ""I - MI"", Assessment 3
10. Respondent 6: SessionName ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"", Assessment 2

Now, I need to group these by SessionName. However, I notice that some session names might be the same but written differently. For example, ""IV (VT)"" and ""IV - VT"" could be the same session but formatted differently. Similarly, ""III - Sepsis"" and ""III (Sepsis)"" might be the same. I need to check if these variations are considered the same session or different. 

Looking at the data, the example given in the problem (the first example) had a session on '2025-05-02' and counted respondents. The key here is that the session names might have different formatting but refer to the same session. For instance, ""III - Sepsis"" and ""III (Sepsis)"" could be the same session. Similarly, ""IV (VT)"" and ""IV - VT"" might be the same. Let's assume that variations in punctuation or spacing (like hyphens vs. parentheses) don't change the session name's identity. So, ""III - Sepsis"" and ""III (Sepsis)"" are considered the same session. Similarly, ""IV (VT)"" and ""IV - VT"" are the same. 

Let me group the sessions accordingly:

1. III Sepsis:
   - Respondent 15: Assessment 2
   - Respondent 8: Assessment 2
   Average: (2 + 2)/2 = 2.0

2. IV VT:
   - Respondent 22: Assessment 2
   - Respondent 18: Assessment 3
   Average: (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5

3. IV-Hypoglycemia:
   - Respondent 14: Assessment 3
   Only one respondent, average 3.0

4. I Myocardial infarction:
   - Respondent 21: Assessment 2
   Only one respondent, average 2.0

5. I-VF:
   - Respondent 13: Assessment 2
   Only one respondent, average 2.0

6. V Hypoglycemia:
   - Respondent 17: Assessment 3
   Only one respondent, average 3.0

7. I MI:
   - Respondent 16: Assessment 3
   Only one respondent, average 3.0

8. II Anaphylactic Shock:
   - Respondent 6: Assessment 2
   Only one respondent, average 2.0

Now, calculate the average for each group:

- III Sepsis: 2.0
- IV VT: 2.5
- IV-Hypoglycemia: 3.0
- I Myocardial infarction: 2.0
- I-VF: 2.0
- V Hypoglycemia: 3.0
- I MI: 3.0
- II Anaphylactic Shock: 2.0

The threshold is average > 1.5. All the averages here are 2.0 or higher, which is greater than 1.5. Wait, that can't be right. Let me check again.

Wait, the task is to find sessions where the average is greater than 1.5. All the calculated averages are 2.0 or higher, so all sessions meet this condition. Therefore, all respondents are part of sessions where the average 'Assessment' is greater than 1.5. 

But let me double-check each session's average:

- III Sepsis: 2 and 2 → 2.0 (which is >1.5)
- IV VT: 2 and 3 → 2.5 (>1.5)
- IV-Hypoglycemia: 3 → 3.0 (>1.5)
- I Myocardial infarction: 2 → 2.0 (>1.5)
- I-VF: 2 → 2.0 (>1.5)
- V Hypoglycemia: 3 → 3.0 (>1.5)
- I MI: 3 → 3.0 (>1.5)
- II Anaphylactic Shock: 2 → 2.0 (>1.5)

So all sessions have an average above 1.5. Therefore, all 10 respondents should be counted. But wait, looking back at the data, there are 10 respondents in total. Let me count them again:

1. 15
2. 22
3. 18
4. 14
5. 21
6. 13
7. 8
8. 17
9. 16
10. 6

That's 10 respondents. But according to the example given, the answer was 0 for a similar question, but that was a different query (date and score 1). Here, all sessions meet the average >1.5, so the count should be 10. But let me check again if I grouped the sessions correctly.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in grouping. Let me re-examine the SessionNames:

Looking at the responses:

- Respondent 15: ""III - Sepsis""
- Respondent 8: ""III (Sepsis)""
Are these considered the same session? The problem statement doesn't specify whether session names are case-sensitive or if variations in formatting (like hyphens vs. parentheses) matter. The example in the problem didn't have this issue, but in real data, this could be a point of confusion. However, since the task is to group by SessionName as given, we have to treat them as different if the names are different. Wait, but in the example, the answer was 0 for a specific date, and the data had two respondents on 2025-05-02 (respondents 8 and 16). But in the example, the answer was 0, which might be because none of them scored 1 on 'Background (examination)'. 

But back to the current task. The key is to group by SessionName exactly as written. Let's list all SessionNames as they appear:

1. III - Sepsis (respondent 15)
2. IV (VT) (respondent 22)
3. IV - VT (respondent 18)
4. IV-Hypoglycemia (respondent 14)
5. I (Myocardial infarction) (respondent 21)
6. I-VF (respondent 13)
7. III (Sepsis) (respondent 8)
8. V (Hypoglycemia) (respondent 17)
9. I - MI (respondent 16)
10. II (Anaphylactic Shock) (respondent 6)

If we take SessionName exactly as written, then each of these is a separate session. Let's check each session's average:

1. III - Sepsis: 1 respondent (15) with Assessment 2 → average 2.0
2. IV (VT): 1 respondent (22) with Assessment 2 → average 2.0
3. IV - VT: 1 respondent (18) with Assessment 3 → average 3.0
4. IV-Hypoglycemia: 1 respondent (14) with Assessment 3 → 3.0
5. I (Myocardial infarction): 1 respondent (21) with Assessment 2 → 2.0
6. I-VF: 1 respondent (13) with Assessment 2 → 2.0
7. III (Sepsis): 1 respondent (8) with Assessment 2 → 2.0
8. V (Hypoglycemia): 1 respondent (17) with Assessment 3 → 3.0
9. I - MI: 1 respondent (16) with Assessment 3 → 3.0
10. II (Anaphylactic Shock): 1 respondent (6) with Assessment 2 → 2.0

Wait, but in this case, each session has only one respondent except for III - Sepsis and III (Sepsis), which are two different sessions. Wait no, respondent 15 is in ""III - Sepsis"" and respondent 8 is in ""III (Sepsis)"". So those are two separate sessions. Similarly, ""IV (VT)"" and ""IV - VT"" are two separate sessions. So each session here has only one respondent. Therefore, each session's average is just the Assessment score of that single respondent. 

Wait, that changes everything. If each SessionName is treated as unique (even if they are variations), then each session has only one respondent, so the average is their individual score. Then, we need to find all respondents where their own Assessment score is part of a session (which is just themselves) where the average is >1.5. But since each session has one person, the average is their own score. So if their Assessment is 2 or 3, which is >1.5, they are counted. 

Looking at all respondents' Assessment scores:

- 15: 2 → yes
- 22: 2 → yes
- 18: 3 → yes
- 14: 3 → yes
- 21: 2 → yes
- 13: 2 → yes
- 8: 2 → yes
- 17: 3 → yes
- 16: 3 → yes
- 6: 2 → yes

All 10 respondents have Assessment scores of 2 or 3, which are all >1.5. Therefore, all 10 should be counted. But this seems too straightforward. However, the problem states ""the average 'Assessment' for that session name"". If the session name is unique per respondent (because of different formatting), then each session has one person, and the average is their own score. But maybe the SessionName is intended to be grouped by the actual session, regardless of formatting. For example, ""III - Sepsis"" and ""III (Sepsis)"" might be the same session. Similarly, ""IV (VT)"" and ""IV - VT"" might be the same. Let's re-examine that possibility.

If we consider that variations in SessionName formatting are just different ways of writing the same session, then:

- ""III - Sepsis"" and ""III (Sepsis)"" → same session (III Sepsis)
- ""IV (VT)"" and ""IV - VT"" → same session (IV VT)
- ""I (Myocardial infarction)"" and ""I - MI"" → MI stands for Myocardial Infarction, so these might be the same session. But ""I - MI"" is respondent 16, and ""I (Myocardial infarction)"" is respondent 21. Wait, but ""I - MI"" and ""I (Myocardial infarction)"" could be the same session. Similarly, ""IV-Hypoglycemia"" and ""V (Hypoglycemia)"" might be different sessions (IV vs. V). 

This is getting complicated. The problem statement doesn't clarify whether SessionNames with similar names but different formatting are considered the same. The example in the problem didn't have this issue because it was filtering by date. 

Given that the data is structured as provided, and the SessionName is taken as written, we must treat each unique string as a separate session. Therefore, each respondent is in their own session, and the average is their own score. Since all Assessment scores are 2 or 3, all 10 respondents are counted. 

But this seems counterintuitive. Maybe the SessionName is intended to group respondents. For example, perhaps multiple respondents can be part of the same session. But looking at the data, each respondent has a unique SessionName except for possible formatting differences. For example, respondents 15 and 8 both have sessions related to Sepsis but with different formatting. If we group them, then the average for that session would be (2 + 2)/2 = 2.0. Similarly, respondents 22 and 18 have sessions related to VT but different formatting. If grouped, their average is (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5. 

Assuming that the SessionName variations are intended to be the same session, then the grouping would be:

1. III Sepsis: respondents 15 and 8 → average 2.0
2. IV VT: respondents 22 and 18 → average 2.5
3. IV-Hypoglycemia: respondent 14 → 3.0
4. I Myocardial infarction: respondent 21 → 2.0
5. I-VF: respondent 13 → 2.0
6. V Hypoglycemia: respondent 17 → 3.0
7. I MI: respondent 16 → 3.0
8. II Anaphylactic Shock: respondent 6 → 2.0

In this case, all these sessions have averages above 1.5. Therefore, all respondents (10) would be counted. 

But this depends on how we group the SessionNames. The problem is ambiguous here. However, given that the example in the problem treated the date as a filter, and the SessionName is part of the data, perhaps the correct approach is to treat SessionName as written, but group variations that are clearly the same session. For example, ""III - Sepsis"" and ""III (Sepsis)"" are the same session, just different formatting. Similarly, ""IV (VT)"" and ""IV - VT"" are the same. 

If we do that, then:

- III Sepsis: respondents 15 and 8 → average 2.0
- IV VT: respondents 22 and 18 → average 2.5
- IV-Hypoglycemia: respondent 14 → 3.0
- I Myocardial infarction: respondent 21 → 2.0
- I-VF: respondent 13 → 2.0
- V Hypoglycemia: respondent 17 → 3.0
- I MI: respondent 16 → 3.0
- II Anaphylactic Shock: respondent 6 → 2.0

All these sessions have averages >=2.0, which is >1.5. Therefore, all respondents are part of sessions with average >1.5. Hence, the count is 10. 

But looking back at the data, respondent 16's SessionName is ""I - MI"" which likely stands for Myocardial Infarction, same as respondent 21's ""I (Myocardial infarction)"". If these are the same session, then:

- I Myocardial Infarction: respondents 21 and 16 → average (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5

But in the data, respondent 21's SessionName is ""I (Myocardial infarction)"" and respondent 16's is ""I - MI"". If MI stands for Myocardial Infarction, then these are the same session. So combining them:

- I Myocardial Infarction: respondents 21 and 16 → average (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5

Similarly, ""I-VF"" (respondent 13) might be a different session. 

This grouping would change the count, but the problem is that the SessionName is written differently. Without explicit instructions, it's ambiguous. However, in real data analysis, such variations would need to be standardized. But given the problem's context, perhaps we should treat SessionNames as case-sensitive and exact matches. 

Alternatively, perhaps the SessionName is intended to be unique per actual session, and different respondents can be in the same session. For example, maybe multiple respondents are part of the same session, hence the same SessionName. But in the data provided, each SessionName is unique except for possible formatting differences. 

Given the ambiguity, but considering that the example in the problem treated the date as a filter (e.g., 2025-05-02 had two respondents), perhaps the same applies here. For instance, if two respondents have the same SessionName (even with different formatting), they are part of the same session. 

But in the data, the SessionNames are:

- III - Sepsis (respondent 15)
- III (Sepsis) (respondent 8)
These could be considered the same session, so their average is (2 + 2)/2 = 2.0.

- IV (VT) (respondent 22)
- IV - VT (respondent 18)
These could be the same session, average (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5.

- I (Myocardial infarction) (respondent 21)
- I - MI (respondent 16)
If MI stands for Myocardial Infarction, these are the same session, average (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5.

Other sessions are single respondents. 

So, grouping these:

1. III Sepsis: 2 respondents → average 2.0
2. IV VT: 2 respondents → average 2.5
3. I Myocardial Infarction: 2 respondents → average 2.5
4. IV-Hypoglycemia: 1 → 3.0
5. I-VF: 1 → 2.0
6. V Hypoglycemia: 1 → 3.0
7. II Anaphylactic Shock: 1 → 2.0

All these sessions have averages >1.5. Therefore, all respondents (10) are counted. 

But wait, if we group the three sessions (III Sepsis, IV VT, I Myocardial Infarction) into",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose 'Background (examination)' is higher than the average 'Background (examination)' for all sessions on the same date.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents whose 'Background (examination)' score is higher than the average 'Background (examination)' score for all sessions on the same date. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The dataset has responses from various respondents, each with a 'Date' and a 'Background (examination)' score. The goal is to group the responses by date, calculate the average score for each date, and then count how many respondents in each date group have a score above that date's average.

Let me start by listing all the responses and their dates and 'Background (examination)' scores. 

Looking at the responses:

1. Respondent 9: Date 2025-05-04, score 2
2. Respondent 7: 2025-03-14, score 3
3. Respondent 4: 2025-05-16, score 2
4. Respondent 2: 2025-04-04, score 3
5. Respondent 14: 2025-03-14, score 2
6. Respondent 1: 2025-05-02, score 2
7. Respondent 8: 2025-05-02, score 2
8. Respondent 22: 2025-05-16, score 3
9. Respondent 20: 2025-05-02, score -1 (but wait, the rubric for 'Background (examination)' is 0-3. A score of -1 might be invalid or missing data. Need to check if this should be considered. Since the task is about scores higher than average, and -1 is below 0, but maybe the system allows negative scores. However, looking at the schema, the rubric for 'Background (examination)' is 0 to 3. So a -1 is probably an error or missing. Should we exclude it? The problem says ""count the respondents"", so maybe include all, but the average calculation might be affected. Hmm. Let's proceed, but note that.)

Now, group by date and calculate average for each date:

First, list all dates and their scores:

- 2025-03-14: scores 3 (Respondent 7) and 2 (Respondent 14). Average = (3+2)/2 = 2.5
- 2025-04-04: score 3 (Respondent 2). Average = 3
- 2025-05-02: scores 2 (Respondent 1), 2 (Respondent 8), -1 (Respondent 20). Average = (2 + 2 + (-1))/3 = (3)/3 = 1.0
- 2025-05-04: score 2 (Respondent 9). Average = 2
- 2025-05-16: scores 2 (Respondent 4) and 3 (Respondent 22). Average = (2+3)/2 = 2.5

Now, for each respondent, check if their score is higher than the average of their date.

Let's go through each respondent:

1. Respondent 9: Date 2025-05-04, score 2. Average is 2. 2 is not higher than 2. So no.
2. Respondent 7: 2025-03-14, score 3. Average 2.5. 3 > 2.5 → yes.
3. Respondent 4: 2025-05-16, score 2. Average 2.5. 2 < 2.5 → no.
4. Respondent 2: 2025-04-04, score 3. Average 3. 3 is not higher → no.
5. Respondent 14: 2025-03-14, score 2. Average 2.5. 2 < 2.5 → no.
6. Respondent 1: 2025-05-02, score 2. Average 1.0. 2 > 1 → yes.
7. Respondent 8: 2025-05-02, score 2. 2 > 1 → yes.
8. Respondent 22: 2025-05-16, score 3. Average 2.5. 3 > 2.5 → yes.
9. Respondent 20: 2025-05-02, score -1. Average 1.0. -1 < 1 → no.

Now, count the ""yes"" cases: Respondent 7, 1, 8, 22. That's 4 respondents.

Wait, but Respondent 20's score is -1. Should that be included in the average calculation? The problem says ""all sessions on the same date"". So even if the score is -1, it's part of the data. So the average for 2025-05-02 is (2 + 2 + (-1)) /3 = 3/3 = 1. So the average is 1.0. Then, respondents 1 and 8 (score 2) are above average. Respondent 20's score is -1, which is below. So that's correct.

So the total count is 4: respondents 7, 1, 8, 22. Let me check again:

- Respondent 7: yes
- Respondent 1: yes
- Respondent 8: yes
- Respondent 22: yes

That's four. So the answer should be 4.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who participated in a session where the average 'Assessment' for that session name is greater than 2.0.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents who participated in a session where the average 'Assessment' score for that session name is greater than 2.0. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The data has a 'responses' array where each respondent has answers, including 'SessionName' and 'Assessment' scores. The goal is to group respondents by their 'SessionName', calculate the average 'Assessment' for each session, and then count how many respondents are in sessions where this average is above 2.0.

Let me start by listing all the responses and their corresponding 'SessionName' and 'Assessment' values. 

Looking at each respondent:

1. Respondent 20: SessionName ""IV (VT)"", Assessment 3
2. Respondent 2: SessionName ""MI"", Assessment 3
3. Respondent 15: SessionName ""III - Sepsis"", Assessment 2
4. Respondent 23: SessionName ""II-Anaphylaxsis"", Assessment 3
5. Respondent 22: SessionName ""IV (VT)"", Assessment 2
6. Respondent 8: SessionName ""III (Sepsis)"", Assessment 2
7. Respondent 19: SessionName ""I - MI"", Assessment 2
8. Respondent 13: SessionName ""I-VF"", Assessment 2

Now, group them by SessionName. Let's note that some session names might be similar but written differently, like ""III - Sepsis"" vs. ""III (Sepsis)"". I need to check if these are considered the same session or different. The names are written differently, so I'll treat them as separate sessions unless there's a clear indication they should be merged. The data doesn't suggest merging, so each unique name is a separate session.

So the sessions are:

- IV (VT): Respondents 20 and 22. Assessments: 3 and 2. Average = (3+2)/2 = 2.5
- MI: Respondent 2. Assessment 3. Average = 3.0
- III - Sepsis: Respondent 15. Assessment 2. Average = 2.0
- II-Anaphylaxsis: Respondent 23. Assessment 3. Average = 3.0
- III (Sepsis): Respondent 8. Assessment 2. Average = 2.0
- I - MI: Respondent 19. Assessment 2. Average = 2.0
- I-VF: Respondent 13. Assessment 2. Average = 2.0

Next, identify which sessions have an average Assessment greater than 2.0. 

Looking at the averages:

- IV (VT): 2.5 > 2.0 → Yes
- MI: 3.0 > 2.0 → Yes
- II-Anaphylaxsis: 3.0 > 2.0 → Yes
The others have averages of exactly 2.0 or less, which doesn't meet the criteria.

Now, count the respondents in these qualifying sessions:

- IV (VT): 2 respondents (20 and 22)
- MI: 1 respondent (2)
- II-Anaphylaxsis: 1 respondent (23)
Total = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4

Wait, but let me double-check. The session ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" has one respondent (23) with Assessment 3. So average is 3.0. That's correct. 

So the total respondents in sessions with average >2.0 are 20, 22, 2, and 23. That's four respondents. 

But wait, the answer in the example was 0, but that was for a different question. This task is different. Let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. 

Yes, the example had a different question (count for date 2025-05-02 and score 1 on Background examination), which resulted in 0. But here, the task is about average Assessment per session. 

So the final count should be 4. But let me check again:

Sessions with average >2.0:

IV (VT): 2.5 → 2 respondents
MI: 3.0 → 1 respondent
II-Anaphylaxsis: 3.0 → 1 respondent
Total: 2+1+1=4. 

Yes, that's correct. So the answer is 4.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score across all rubric items is below the average total score for all sessions.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the number of respondents whose total score across all rubric items is below the average total score for all sessions. 

First, I need to understand which fields in the responses are rubric items. Looking at the questions section, the rubric items are: Identification, Situation, Background (history), Background (examination), Assessment, Recommendation (clear recommendation), and Recommendation (global rating scale). Each of these has a score from 0 to 3. The other fields like Date, SessionName, and Comments are open-ended and don't contribute to the score.

Next, I need to calculate the total score for each respondent. Let's go through each response one by one.

Starting with respondent 8:
- Identification: 3
- Situation: 3
- Background (history): 3
- Background (examination): 2
- Assessment: 2
- Recommendation (clear recommendation): 2
- Recommendation (global rating scale): 3
Total = 3+3+3+2+2+2+3 = 18

Respondent 18:
- All rubric items: 3,3,2,2,3,2,2. Total = 3+3+2+2+3+2+2 = 17

Respondent 7:
- Scores: 3,3,2,3,2,2,2. Total = 3+3+2+3+2+2+2 = 17

Respondent 2:
- 3,3,2,3,3,2,1. Total = 3+3+2+3+3+2+1 = 17

Respondent 5:
- 3,3,3,3,3,2,3. Total = 3+3+3+3+3+2+3 = 20

Respondent 17:
- 3,3,3,3,3,3,2. Total = 3+3+3+3+3+3+2 = 20

Respondent 10:
- 2,2,2,2,2,2,2. Total = 2+2+2+2+2+2+2 = 14

Respondent 23:
- 3,3,2,2,3,3,3. Total = 3+3+2+2+3+3+3 = 19

Respondent 14:
- 3,3,2,2,3,1,2. Total = 3+3+2+2+3+1+2 = 16

Respondent 12:
- 3,3,3,3,2,3,3. Total = 3+3+3+3+2+3+3 = 20

Respondent 22:
- 3,3,3,3,2,2,3. Total = 3+3+3+3+2+2+3 = 19

Now, let's list all the totals:
18, 17, 17, 17, 20, 20, 14, 19, 16, 20, 19.

Next, calculate the average total score. Sum all these totals and divide by the number of respondents (11).

Sum = 18+17+17+17+20+20+14+19+16+20+19 = 
Let's add step by step:
18+17=35
35+17=52
52+17=69
69+20=89
89+20=109
109+14=123
123+19=142
142+16=158
158+20=178
178+19=197

Total sum is 197. Average = 197 / 11 ≈ 17.909. So the average is approximately 17.91.

Now, find how many respondents have a total below this average. Since the average is ~17.91, scores below 17.91 are 17 and lower. 

Looking at the totals:
- 18: above
- 17: below
- 17: below
- 17: below

The scores below 17.91 are 17,17,17,14,16. That's 5 respondents. Wait, let me check again:

Wait, the totals are:

Respondent 8: 18 (above)
18:17 (below)
7:17 (below)
2:17 (below)
5:20 (above)
17:20 (above)
10:14 (below)
23:19 (above)
14:16 (below)
12:20 (above)
22:19 (above)

So the respondents with totals below 17.91 are respondents 18,7,2,10,14. That's 5 respondents. Wait, 18's total is 17, which is below 17.91. Then 7,2,10,14. Wait, 18,7,2,10,14: that's 5. But let me count again:

Looking at the list of totals:

18,17,17,17,20,20,14,19,16,20,19.

Wait, the list of totals in order of respondents:

1. 18 (18)
2. 18 (17)
3. 7 (17)
4. 2 (17)
5.5 (20)
6.17 (20)
7.10 (14)
8.23 (19)
9.14 (16)
10.12 (20)
11.22 (19)

So the totals are:

18,17,17,17,20,20,14,19,16,20,19.

Now, the average is 197/11 ≈17.909. So any total less than 17.909 is below average. So 17,17,17,14,16. That's five instances. So five respondents have totals below the average. 

Wait, 17 is 17, which is less than 17.909. So each 17 is below. Then 14 and 16 are also below. So how many 17s are there? Let's see:

Looking at the list of totals:

18,17,17,17,20,20,14,19,16,20,19.

So 17 appears three times (respondents 18,7,2), 14 once (respondent10), 16 once (respondent14). So total of 3+1+1=5 respondents. 

Therefore, the answer should be 5.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose 'Assessment' is higher than the average 'Assessment' for all sessions on the same date.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents whose 'Assessment' score is higher than the average 'Assessment' for all sessions on the same date. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The dataset has a 'responses' array where each respondent has an 'answers' object containing various fields, including 'Date' and 'Assessment'. The 'Assessment' is a numerical value based on a rubric. 

The plan is:
1. Calculate the average 'Assessment' score for each date.
2. For each respondent, compare their 'Assessment' score to the average of their respective date.
3. Count how many respondents have a score higher than their date's average.

Let me start by extracting all the dates and their corresponding 'Assessment' scores. 

Looking at the responses:
- Respondent 19: Date 2025-05-16, Assessment 2
- Respondent 20: Date 2025-05-02, Assessment 3
- Respondent 11: Date 2025-04-04, Assessment 3
- Respondent 8: Date 2025-05-02, Assessment 2
- Respondent 10: Date 2025-03-14, Assessment 2
- Respondent 5: Date 2025-05-04, Assessment 3
- Respondent 17: Date 2025-05-04, Assessment 3
- Respondent 22: Date 2025-05-16, Assessment 2
- Respondent 7: Date 2025-03-14, Assessment 2
- Respondent 18: Date 2025-05-04, Assessment 3

Now, group the 'Assessment' scores by date:

- 2025-03-14: 2 (Respondent 10), 2 (Respondent 7) → Average = (2 + 2)/2 = 2
- 2025-04-04: 3 (Respondent 11) → Average = 3
- 2025-05-02: 3 (Respondent 20), 2 (Respondent 8) → Average = (3 + 2)/2 = 2.5
- 2025-05-04: 3 (Respondent 5), 3 (Respondent 17), 3 (Respondent 18) → Average = (3 + 3 + 3)/3 = 3
- 2025-05-16: 2 (Respondent 19), 2 (Respondent 22) → Average = (2 + 2)/2 = 2

Next, compare each respondent's 'Assessment' to their date's average:

- Respondent 19: 2 vs 2 → not higher
- Respondent 20: 3 vs 2.5 → higher
- Respondent 11: 3 vs 3 → not higher (equal)
- Respondent 8: 2 vs 2.5 → lower
- Respondent 10: 2 vs 2 → not higher
- Respondent 5: 3 vs 3 → equal
- Respondent 17: 3 vs 3 → equal
- Respondent 22: 2 vs 2 → not higher
- Respondent 7: 2 vs 2 → not higher
- Respondent 18: 3 vs 3 → equal

Only Respondent 20 has an 'Assessment' score (3) higher than their date's average (2.5). So the count is 1.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' score is equal to the average 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' score for all sessions that occurred on the same date.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the number of respondents whose 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' score equals the average score of all sessions on the same date. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The 'responses' array contains each respondent's answers, including the 'Date' and 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' score. The goal is to group responses by date, calculate the average for each date, then count how many respondents on each date have a score equal to that date's average. Finally, sum all those counts.

Let me start by listing all the responses and their dates and scores. Let's go through each respondent:

1. Respondent 2: Date 2025-04-04, score 2
2. Respondent 18: 2025-05-04, score 2
3. Respondent 19: 2025-05-16, score 3
4. Respondent 6: 2025-04-04, score 2
5. Respondent 14: 2025-03-14, score 1
6. Respondent 22: 2025-05-16, score 2
7. Respondent 16: 2025-05-02, score 2
8. Respondent 23: 2025-03-14, score 3
9. Respondent 20: 2025-05-02, score 2
10. Respondent 11: 2025-04-04, score 3

Now, group them by date:

- 2025-03-14: Respondents 14 (score 1) and 23 (score 3)
  Average = (1 + 3)/2 = 2
  Count of respondents with score 2 here: 0 (since scores are 1 and 3)

- 2025-04-04: Respondents 2 (2), 6 (2), 11 (3)
  Average = (2 + 2 + 3)/3 = 7/3 ≈ 2.333
  Since scores are integers, the average isn't a whole number. So no one here has a score equal to the average (2.333), which isn't possible. So count 0.

- 2025-05-02: Respondents 16 (2) and 20 (2)
  Average = (2 + 2)/2 = 2
  Both have score 2. So count 2.

- 2025-05-04: Respondent 18 (2)
  Average is 2. So count 1.

- 2025-05-16: Respondents 19 (3) and 22 (2)
  Average = (3 + 2)/2 = 2.5
  No one has 2.5, so count 0.

Now sum all counts: 0 (03-14) + 0 (04-04) + 2 (05-02) + 1 (05-04) + 0 (05-16) = 3.

Wait, wait. Let me check again. 

Wait, for 2025-03-14, average is 2. So any respondent on that date with score 2? The respondents there have 1 and 3. So none. Correct.

2025-04-04: average is 2.333. No one has that exact score. So 0.

2025-05-02: average 2. Both have 2. So 2.

2025-05-04: only one respondent with 2. Average is 2. So count 1.

2025-05-16: average 2.5. No one. 

So total is 2 (from 05-02) + 1 (05-04) = 3. 

But wait, looking back at the data:

Wait, respondent 18 is on 2025-05-04 with score 2. So that's one. 

Respondents 16 and 20 on 05-02 both have 2. So two. 

So total 1 + 2 = 3. 

But let me check again. 

Wait, the task says ""count the respondents whose score is equal to the average for all sessions on the same date."" So for each respondent, check if their score equals the average of their date's group. Then count how many such respondents there are in total.

So:

For each date:

- 2025-03-14: average 2. Respondents here: 14 (1) and 23 (3). Neither equals 2. So 0.

- 2025-04-04: average 2.333. Respondents: 2 (2), 6 (2), 11 (3). None have 2.333. So 0.

- 2025-05-02: average 2. Respondents: 16 (2), 20 (2). Both equal 2. So 2.

- 2025-05-04: average 2. Respondent 18 (2). So 1.

- 2025-05-16: average 2.5. Respondents 19 (3), 22 (2). None. So 0.

Total is 2 + 1 = 3. 

Therefore, the answer should be 3.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose 'Background (examination)' is higher than the average 'Background (examination)' for all sessions on the same date.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents whose 'Background (examination)' score is higher than the average for all sessions on the same date. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The dataset has responses with various answers, including the date of the session and the 'Background (examination)' score. Each respondent is part of a session on a specific date.

The plan is to:

1. **Calculate the average 'Background (examination)' score for each date.**
2. **Compare each respondent's score to the average of their respective date.**
3. **Count how many respondents have a score higher than their date's average.**

Let's start by extracting all the dates and their corresponding 'Background (examination)' scores. Looking at the responses:

- Respondent 17: Date 2025-05-04, score 3
- Respondent 11: 2025-04-04, 3
- Respondent 14: 2025-03-14, 2
- Respondent 21: 2025-05-16, 1
- Respondent 5: 2025-05-04, 3
- Respondent 10: 2025-03-14, 2
- Respondent 13: 2025-03-14, 1
- Respondent 6: 2025-04-04, 3
- Respondent 23: 2025-03-14, 2
- Respondent 9: 2025-05-04, 2
- Respondent 8: 2025-05-02, 2

Now, group the scores by date:

- **2025-05-04**: Scores are 3 (17), 3 (5), 2 (9) → Average = (3+3+2)/3 = 8/3 ≈ 2.67
- **2025-04-04**: Scores 3 (11), 3 (6) → Average = (3+3)/2 = 3
- **2025-03-14**: Scores 2 (14), 2 (10), 1 (13), 2 (23) → Average = (2+2+1+2)/4 = 7/4 = 1.75
- **2025-05-16**: Score 1 (21) → Average = 1
- **2025-05-02**: Score 2 (8) → Average = 2

Next, compare each respondent's score to their date's average:

- **2025-05-04** (avg 2.67):
  - 17: 3 > 2.67 → Yes
  - 5: 3 > 2.67 → Yes
  - 9: 2 < 2.67 → No
- **2024-04-04** (avg 3):
  - 11: 3 = 3 → No
  - 6: 3 = 3 → No
- **2025-03-14** (avg 1.75):
  - 14: 2 > 1.75 → Yes
  - 10: 2 > 1.75 → Yes
  - 13: 1 < 1.75 → No
  - 23: 2 > 1.75 → Yes
- **2025-05-16** (avg 1):
  - 21: 1 = 1 → No
- **2025-05-02** (avg 2):
  - 8: 2 = 2 → No

Now, count the respondents who scored higher than the average on their date:

- 17, 5, 14, 10, 23 → Total of 5 respondents.

Wait, let me double-check. For 2025-03-14, the average is 1.75. Respondents 14, 10, and 23 have scores of 2, which is higher. Respondent 13 has 1, which is lower. So that's three on that date. Then 17 and 5 on 2025-05-04. That's 5 total. 

Yes, that's correct. So the answer should be 5.
