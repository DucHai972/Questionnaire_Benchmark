</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who participated in a 'II-Anaphylaxsis' session.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The question is asking to count the respondents who participated in a session named 'II-Anaphylaxsis'. 

First, I need to look at the data provided in the responses section. Each respondent has a pred:SessionName property that indicates the name of the session they attended. My goal is to find all respondents where this value exactly matches 'II-Anaphylaxsis'.

I'll start by going through each respondent one by one. Let's list them out:

- Respondent1: SessionName is ""V (Hypoglycemia)"" – doesn't match.
- Respondent3: SessionName is ""III-Sepsis"" – nope.
- Respondent13: ""I-VF"" – not matching.
- Respondent17: ""V (Hypoglycemia)"" – no.
- Respondent15: ""III - Sepsis"" – different.
- Respondent8: ""III (Sepsis)"" – not the one.
- Respondent7: ""III-Sepsis"" – still not.
- Respondent12: ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" – close, but the spelling is slightly different. The task specifies 'II-Anaphylaxsis' with two 's's. So this might be a typo, but I need to check the exact match.
- Respondent23: SessionName is ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" – this matches exactly.
- Respondent19: ""I - MI"" – no.
- Respondent5: ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" – the session name here has a space after II and a hyphen, but the name part is ""Anaphylaxsis"" which matches. Wait, the task is looking for 'II-Anaphylaxsis' – but here it's ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" (with a space after the hyphen). The exact string comparison would need to check if the session name is exactly 'II-Anaphylaxsis' without any spaces. Let me check the actual data entries.

Looking at Respondent23's SessionName: ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" (no space after II). Respondent5's SessionName is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" (with a space and hyphen). The task's target is 'II-Anaphylaxsis', so only Respondent23 matches exactly. Respondent5's session name has a space after II, so it's ""II - Anaphylaxsis"", which is different. Similarly, Respondent12 has ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" which is a different spelling (Anaphylaxis vs. Anaphylaxsis). 

So, only Respondent23 has the exact SessionName ""II-Anaphylaxsis"". Therefore, the count is 1.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who participated in a 'II - Anaphylaxsis' session.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task. The question is asking to count the respondents who participated in a 'II - Anaphylaxsis' session. 

First, I need to look at the data provided in the responses section. Each respondent has a pred:SessionName property that indicates the session they attended. The task is to find all respondents where this SessionName exactly matches 'II - Anaphylaxsis'.

Looking through the list of respondents:

- Respondent23 has SessionName ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" (note the single hyphen and spelling).
- Respondent5 has SessionName ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" (with spaces around the hyphen).
- Respondent12 has SessionName ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" (different formatting and spelling of Anaphylaxis vs Anaphylaxsis).
- Others have different session names like ""I - MI"", ""V (Hypoglycemia)"", etc.

Wait, the target session is 'II - Anaphylaxsis'. Let me check the exact spelling and formatting. The example in the data shows that Respondent5's SessionName is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" with spaces around the hyphen. However, Respondent23's is ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" without spaces. The task specifies 'II - Anaphylaxsis', so I need to match exactly, including the spacing around the hyphen. 

But wait, the task might have a typo. Let me check the exact task again. The user wrote 'II - Anaphylaxsis' with a space before and after the hyphen. So I need to look for that exact string. 

Looking at the responses:

- Respondent5: ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" – matches exactly.
- Respondent23: ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" – no spaces around hyphen, so doesn't match.
- Respondent12: ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" – different name and spelling (Anaphylaxis vs Anaphylaxsis).

So only Respondent5 matches the exact session name. Therefore, the count is 1.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who scored 3 on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The question is asking to count the respondents who scored 3 on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)'. 

First, I need to make sure I understand the data structure. The data provided includes a list of respondents, each with various predicates (pred:) that correspond to their answers. The 'Recommendation_clear_recommendation' predicate holds the score for the clear recommendation question.

Looking at the questions section, the 'QRecommendation_clear_recommendation' has a rubric where 3 means ""Clear comprehensive recommendation without questioning"". So, I need to find all respondents where the value of pred:Recommendation_clear_recommendation is ""3"".

Now, I'll go through each respondent in the responses section and check their pred:Recommendation_clear_recommendation value.

Starting with :Respondent8, their score is ""2"". Not a match.

:Respondent2 has ""2"" as well. 

:Respondent17 has a score of ""3"" – that's one.

:Respondent23 also has ""3"" – that's two.

:Respondent20's score is ""2"".

:Respondent22 is ""2"".

:Respondent4 is ""2"".

:Respondent14 has ""1"".

So, only Respondent17 and Respondent23 have a score of 3. That makes a total of 2 respondents.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents from the 'II (Anaphylactic Shock)' session who scored 1 on 'Background (history)' and 2 on 'Situation'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents from the session named 'II (Anaphylactic Shock)' who scored 1 on 'Background (history)' and 2 on 'Situation'. 

First, I need to make sure I understand the data structure. The questions section defines each predicate. For example, 'QBackground_history' corresponds to the 'Gives appropriate history' question with a rubric where 1 means ""Relevant history but frequent clarification needed"". Similarly, 'QSituation' is about identifying the main problem(s), and a score of 2 means ""Identifies the main problem(s) with fewer prompts needed"".

Now, looking at the responses, each respondent has a SessionName, a Date, and various scores. The task is to filter respondents based on three criteria:
1. SessionName is exactly 'II (Anaphylactic Shock)'.
2. Background_history score is 1.
3. Situation score is 2.

Wait, the task says 'Background (history)' score 1 and 'Situation' score 2. Let me confirm the predicates. The 'Background (history)' corresponds to 'pred:Background_history', and 'Situation' is 'pred:Situation'.

Now, I need to go through each respondent in the data and check these three conditions.

Looking at the respondents:

- Respondent23: SessionName is ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" – not matching. Background_history is 2, Situation 3. Doesn't meet.
- Respondent16: SessionName ""I - MI"" – no. Background_history 3, Situation 3. No.
- Respondent4: SessionName ""III (Sepsis)"" – no. Background_history 3, Situation 3. No.
- Respondent5: SessionName ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" – close but not exact. Background_history 3, Situation 3. No.
- Respondent1: SessionName ""V (Hypoglycemia)"" – no. Background_history 2, Situation 2. Doesn't meet.
- Respondent18: SessionName ""IV - VT"" – no. Background_history 2, Situation 3. No.
- Respondent6: SessionName ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"" – this matches the session name. Let's check their scores. Background_history is 3, Situation is 2. So Background_history is 3, which is not 1. So doesn't meet.
- Respondent14: SessionName ""IV-Hypoglycemia"" – no. Background_history 2, Situation 3. No.
- Respondent11: SessionName ""IV (AF)"" – no. Background_history 3, Situation 3. No.
- Respondent8: SessionName ""III (Sepsis)"" – no. Background_history 3, Situation 3. No.

Wait, so the only respondent with SessionName ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"" is Respondent6. But their Background_history is 3, not 1. So there are no respondents that meet all three criteria. Therefore, the count is 0.

But let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss any other respondents. Scanning through the list again, no other respondents have the exact SessionName ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"". Respondent6 is the only one. Their Background_history is 3, which is higher than required. So no matches. The answer should be 0.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who scored 0 on 'Background (history)' and whose 'Comments' contain the word 'Clear'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The goal is to count the respondents who scored 0 on 'Background (history)' and have the word 'Clear' in their comments. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The 'Background (history)' corresponds to the predicate pred:Background_history. The rubric for this question is defined in the questions section: ""Gives appropriate history. [Rubric: 0 = History is unstructured or non-relevant, 1 = Relevant history but frequent clarification needed, 2 = Relevant history with few further questions needed, 3 = Comprehensive focused history]"". So, a score of 0 here means the history was unstructured or non-relevant.

Next, I need to look at each respondent's pred:Background_history value and check if it's ""0"". Then, I also need to check their pred:Comments to see if the word 'Clear' appears anywhere, case-sensitive as per the output rules.

Looking at the responses:

- Respondent21: Background_history is ""3"", so no. Comments mention ""Diagnostic clarity is present"" and ""Good..."", but 'clarity' isn't 'Clear', so even if it was 0, it wouldn't count here.
- Respondent7: Background_history ""2"", so no.
- Respondent10: Background_history ""2"", no.
- Respondent11: Background_history ""3"", no.
- Respondent23: Background_history ""2"", no.
- Respondent2: Background_history ""2"", no.
- Respondent3: Background_history ""3"", no.
- Respondent8: Background_history ""3"", no.
- Respondent9: Background_history ""2"", no.
- Respondent12: Background_history ""3"", no.
- Respondent14: Background_history ""2"", no.
- Respondent1: Background_history ""2"", no.

Wait, none of the respondents have a Background_history score of 0. Let me double-check each one again to be sure. Scanning through all the pred:Background_history entries:

- All respondents have scores of 2, 3, or in the case of Respondent1, 2. No one has a 0. 

Additionally, even if someone had a 0, their comments need to include 'Clear'. But since there are no 0s in Background_history, the count is 0.

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 'Background (history)' is greater than 5.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents whose total score for 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 'Background (history)' is greater than 5. 

First, I need to identify which predicates in the data correspond to these two questions. Looking at the questions section:

- 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is associated with the predicate `pred:Recommendation_global_rating_scale`. The rubric for this question is a scale from 0 to 3.
- 'Background (history)' corresponds to `pred:Background_history`, also on a 0-3 scale.

So, for each respondent, I need to sum the values of these two predicates and check if the total is greater than 5.

Now, let's go through each respondent in the responses section and calculate their scores:

1. **Respondent14**:
   - `pred:Background_history` is ""2""
   - `pred:Recommendation_global_rating_scale` is ""2""
   - Sum: 2 + 2 = 4 → Not greater than 5.

2. **Respondent6**:
   - Background_history: ""3""
   - Recommendation_global_rating_scale: ""3""
   - Sum: 3 + 3 = 6 → Greater than 5. Count this one.

3. **Respondent2**:
   - Background_history: ""2""
   - Recommendation_global_rating_scale: ""1""
   - Sum: 2 + 1 = 3 → No.

4. **Respondent13**:
   - Background_history: ""2""
   - Recommendation_global_rating_scale: ""2""
   - Sum: 2 + 2 = 4 → No.

5. **Respondent16**:
   - Background_history: ""3""
   - Recommendation_global_rating_scale: ""3""
   - Sum: 3 + 3 = 6 → Yes. Count this.

6. **Respondent22**:
   - Background_history: ""3""
   - Recommendation_global_rating_scale: ""3""
   - Sum: 3 + 3 = 6 → Yes. Count.

7. **Respondent10**:
   - Background_history: ""2""
   - Recommendation_global_rating_scale: ""2""
   - Sum: 2 + 2 = 4 → No.

So, the respondents who meet the criteria are Respondent6, Respondent16, and Respondent22. That's a total of 3 respondents.

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Background (history)' and 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is greater than 3.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents whose total score for 'Background (history)' and 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is greater than 3. 

First, I need to make sure I understand which predicates in the data correspond to these two categories. Looking at the questions section:

- 'Background (history)' is associated with the predicate `pred:Background_history`, and the rubric is for the question ""Gives appropriate history."" The possible scores are 0 to 3.
- 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is linked to `pred:Recommendation_global_rating_scale`, with the question ""Global Rating Scale (GRS)..."", also scored 0 to 3.

So, for each respondent, I need to sum their scores from these two fields and check if the total is greater than 3.

Now, let's go through each respondent in the responses section and calculate their scores:

1. **Respondent1**:
   - Background_history: ""2""
   - Recommendation_global_rating_scale: ""2""
   - Total: 2 + 2 = 4. This is greater than 3. So, count this one.

2. **Respondent10**:
   - Background_history: ""2""
   - Recommendation_global_rating_scale: ""2""
   - Total: 2 + 2 = 4. Also greater than 3. Count this.

3. **Respondent19**:
   - Background_history: ""3""
   - Recommendation_global_rating_scale: ""3""
   - Total: 3 + 3 = 6. Definitely greater than 3. Count.

4. **Respondent20**:
   - Background_history: ""2""
   - Recommendation_global_rating_scale: ""3""
   - Total: 2 + 3 = 5. Greater than 3. Count.

5. **Respondent4**:
   - Background_history: ""3""
   - Recommendation_global_rating_scale: ""2""
   - Total: 3 + 2 = 5. Also greater than 3. Count.

Wait, but let me double-check each entry to make sure I didn't miss any. All five respondents have scores that add up to 4, 4, 6, 5, and 5 respectively. All of these totals are greater than 3. So that would mean all five respondents meet the criteria. But wait, the example given in the problem had an answer of 0, but that was for a different question. Let me make sure I'm not mixing up the data.

Wait, looking back at the data provided in the questionnaire section, the respondents are:

- Respondent1: Background_history ""2"", GRS ""2"" → 4
- Respondent10: ""2"", ""2"" → 4
- Respondent19: ""3"", ""3"" → 6
- Respondent20: ""2"", ""3"" →5
- Respondent4: ""3"", ""2"" →5

So all five respondents have a total greater than 3. But wait, the data in the example and the questionnaire might be the same. Wait, in the example, the answer was 0, but that was for a different question (sessions on 2025-05-02 with score 1 on Background_examination). But in the current task, the question is about Background_history and Recommendation_global_rating_scale. 

Wait, but looking at the data again:

Wait, the respondents in the current task's data are:

- Respondent1: Background_history ""2"", GRS ""2"" → 4
- Respondent10: ""2"", ""2"" →4
- Respondent19: ""3"", ""3"" →6
- Respondent20: ""2"", ""3"" →5
- Respondent4: ""3"", ""2"" →5

So all five respondents have a sum greater than 3. Therefore, the count should be 5. But I need to check if there are any other respondents in the data. Wait, the data provided in the questionnaire section includes only these five respondents: Respondent1, Respondent10, Respondent19, Respondent20, Respondent4. Are there more? No, the list ends at Respondent4. So all five respondents meet the criteria, so the answer should be 5. But wait, let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me list each respondent's scores:

1. **Respondent1**:
   - Background_history: 2
   - GRS: 2
   - Total: 4 → >3 → count

2. **Respondent10**:
   - Background_history: 2
   - GRS: 2
   - Total: 4 → count

3. **Respondent19**:
   - Background_history:3
   - GRS:3 → total 6 → count

4. **Respondent20**:
   - Background_history:2
   - GRS:3 → total 5 → count

5. **Respondent4**:
   - Background_history:3
   - GRS:2 → total 5 → count

So all five respondents have a total greater than 3. Therefore, the answer should be 5. But wait, the example in the problem had an answer of 0, but that was for a different question. However, in the current task, according to the data provided, all five respondents meet the criteria. But wait, let me check the data again to ensure I didn't misread any values.

Looking at each respondent:

- **Respondent1**: Both scores are 2. Sum 4. Correct.
- **Respondent10**: Both 2. Sum 4. Correct.
- **Respondent19**: 3 and 3. Sum 6. Correct.
- **Respondent20**: 2 and 3. Sum 5. Correct.
- **Respondent4**: 3 and 2. Sum 5. Correct.

Yes, all five. Therefore, the count is 5. But the example answer was 0, but that's for a different question. So the answer here should be 5. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the predicate mapping. Let me check the predicates again.

The task is about 'Background (history)' and 'Recommendation (global rating scale)'. 

In the data, 'Background (history)' is `pred:Background_history`, and 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is `pred:Recommendation_global_rating_scale`. So yes, those are the correct predicates. All the respondents have values for these two fields, and all sums are over 3. Therefore, the answer is 5. But wait, the data provided in the questionnaire section only has five respondents. So the count is 5. But maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps some respondents have negative values? For example, in the example, Respondent1 has Identification ""-1"", but in the current data, for the two relevant fields, are there any negative values? Let's check:

- Respondent1: Background_history ""2"", GRS ""2"" → both positive.
- Respondent10: both ""2"".
- Respondent19: ""3"" and ""3"".
- Respondent20: Background_history ""2"", GRS ""3"".
- Respondent4: ""3"" and ""2"".

No negative values in the two relevant fields. So all five are valid. Therefore, the answer is 5. But the example had a different answer, but that's okay because the tasks are different. So the final answer here should be 5.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who scored 2 on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and whose 'Comments' contain the word 'communication'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The goal is to count the respondents who scored 2 on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and have the word 'communication' in their comments. 

First, I need to make sure I understand the data structure. The questions section defines each predicate. The 'Recommendation_global_rating_scale' corresponds to the question about the Global Rating Scale (GRS), with the rubric ranging from 0 to 3. The 'Comments' field is an open-ended text response.

Looking at the responses, each respondent has various predicates like pred:Recommendation_global_rating_scale and pred:Comments. I need to check two conditions for each respondent: 

1. Their 'Recommendation_global_rating_scale' score is exactly ""2"".
2. Their 'Comments' field contains the word 'communication' (case-insensitive, but the output requires preserving capitalization, so I should check for any case).

Let me go through each respondent one by one.

Starting with :Respondent10. Their pred:Recommendation_global_rating_scale is ""2"". Now, check the comments: ""Time: (15:53-16:14)"". No mention of 'communication' here. So, doesn't qualify.

Next, :Respondent15. Their GRS is ""2"". Comments: ""Detailed Response - clear communication"". The word 'communication' is present. So this one counts. That's 1.

:Respondent21 has GRS ""3"", so skip.

:Respondent18: GRS is ""2"". Comments: ""Not very concise or clear communication"". 'Communication' is there. So that's another one. Total 2.

:Respondent17: GRS is ""2""? Wait, looking at their pred:Recommendation_global_rating_scale, it's ""2"". Comments: ""Concise - clear\nSatisfactory"". The word 'communication' isn't present. So no.

Wait, wait. Wait, no. Let me check again. Respondent17's pred:Recommendation_global_rating_scale is ""2""? Let me check the data. 

Looking at :Respondent17's entry: pred:Recommendation_global_rating_scale ""2"" ;. Yes. Comments: ""Concise - clear\nSatisfactory"". The word 'communication' isn't there. So no.

Next, :Respondent16: GRS is ""3"". Skip.

:Respondent5: GRS is ""3"". Skip.

:Respondent22: GRS is ""3"". Skip.

:Respondent19: GRS is ""3"". Skip.

:Respondent4: GRS is ""2"". Comments: ""Clinical handover and communication skills, satisfactory\nNo panic, no arrest team\nSatisfactory"". 'Communication' is present. So that's the third one. Total 3.

Wait, let me verify each again to be sure.

Respondent15: GRS 2, comments have 'communication' – yes.

Respondent18: GRS 2, comments: 'communication' – yes.

Respondent4: GRS 2, comments: 'communication' – yes.

Wait, that's three respondents. But let me check all again.

Wait, :Respondent18's GRS is ""2""? Let me check the data. 

Looking at :Respondent18's entry: pred:Recommendation_global_rating_scale ""2"" ;. Yes. Comments: ""Not very concise or clear communication"". So that's correct.

Respondent4: pred:Recommendation_global_rating_scale ""2"" ;. Comments: ""Clinical handover and communication skills..."". So yes.

So total of three respondents: 15, 18, and 4. Wait, but wait, the answer in the example was 0, but that was for a different question. The current task is different.

Wait, the task here is to count those with GRS 2 and comments containing 'communication'. Let me check each again.

Wait, :Respondent15: GRS 2, comments have 'communication' – yes.

:Respondent18: GRS 2, comments have 'communication' – yes.

:Respondent4: GRS 2, comments have 'communication' – yes.

So that's three. But let me check all other respondents again to make sure I didn't miss any.

:Respondent10: GRS 2, comments no 'communication' – no.

:Respondent17: GRS 2, comments no 'communication' – no.

Any others with GRS 2? Let's see:

Looking through all:

- :Respondent10: 2
- :Respondent15: 2
- :Respondent18: 2
- :Respondent4: 2

Wait, :Respondent4's GRS is 2? Let me check again. Yes, pred:Recommendation_global_rating_scale ""2"".

So that's four respondents with GRS 2. Now check their comments.

:Respondent10: comments don't have 'communication'.

:Respondent15: comments do.

:Respondent18: comments do.

:Respondent4: comments do.

Wait, so that's three respondents (15, 18, 4) with GRS 2 and 'communication' in comments. So the count is 3.

Wait, but let me check :Respondent4's GRS again. The data says:

:Respondent4 a :Person ;
    pred:Date ""2025-05-16"" ;
    pred:SessionName ""III (Sepsis)"" ;
    pred:Identification ""3"" ;
    pred:Situation ""3"" ;
    pred:Background_history ""3"" ;
    pred:Background_examination ""2"" ;
    pred:Assessment ""2"" ;
    pred:Recommendation_clear_recommendation ""2"" ;
    pred:Recommendation_global_rating_scale ""2"" ;
    pred:Comments ""Clinical handover and communication skills, satisfactory
No panic, no arrest team
Satisfactory""  .

Yes, GRS is 2, and comments have 'communication'. So that's correct.

So total of three respondents. Therefore, the answer should be 3.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Identification' and 'Assessment' is greater than 6.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents whose total score for 'Identification' and 'Assessment' is greater than 6. 

First, I need to understand what 'Identification' and 'Assessment' refer to in the data. Looking at the questions section, I see:

- :QIdentification pred:Text ""Identification of self, role, and patient. [Rubric: 0 = Requires direct prompting, 1 = Introduces themselves but only after a hint, 2 = Introduces themselves but information is incomplete, 3 = Introduces themselves and information is complete]"" 
- :QAssessment pred:Text ""Makes logical assessment (correlates problem, history, exam, context). [Rubric: 0 = No logical assessment, 1 = Assessment only after extended questioning, 2 = Assessment after minimal questioning, 3 = Comprehensive logical assessment without questioning]"" 

So each of these questions is scored from 0 to 3. The task is to sum the scores for each respondent's Identification and Assessment, then check if the sum is greater than 6.

Now, I need to go through each respondent in the responses section and calculate their total for these two fields.

Let's list out all respondents and their scores:

1. **Respondent11**:
   - Identification: 3
   - Assessment: 3
   - Total: 3 + 3 = 6 → Not greater than 6.

2. **Respondent6**:
   - Identification: 3
   - Assessment: 2
   - Total: 3 + 2 = 5 → No.

3. **Respondent15**:
   - Identification: 3
   - Assessment: 2
   - Total: 5 → No.

4. **Respondent9**:
   - Identification: 3
   - Assessment: 2
   - Total: 5 → No.

5. **Respondent22**:
   - Identification: 3
   - Assessment: 2
   - Total: 5 → No.

6. **Respondent1**:
   - Identification: -1 (Wait, this is a negative value. But according to the rubric, scores are 0-3. Maybe a typo? But the data shows ""-1"". However, the rubric doesn't have negative scores. But since the data has it, we have to take it as is. So -1 + 3 = 2 → No.)

7. **Respondent23**:
   - Identification: 3
   - Assessment: 3
   - Total: 6 → No.

8. **Respondent10**:
   - Identification: 2
   - Assessment: 2
   - Total: 4 → No.

Looking at all these, none of the respondents have a total score greater than 6. The highest total is 6 (Respondent11 and Respondent23), but the requirement is greater than 6, so 6 doesn't count. Therefore, the count is 0.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents from the 'V (Hypoglycemia)' session who scored 0 on 'Identification' and 1 on 'Assessment'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The goal is to count the number of respondents from the 'V (Hypoglycemia)' session who scored 0 on 'Identification' and 1 on 'Assessment'. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The data has respondents with various properties like Date, SessionName, Identification, Situation, etc. The questions section defines what each predicate means. For this task, the key predicates are pred:SessionName, pred:Identification, and pred:Assessment.

Looking at the task, I need to filter respondents based on three criteria:
1. SessionName must be 'V (Hypoglycemia)'.
2. Identification score must be 0.
3. Assessment score must be 1.

Now, I'll go through each respondent in the data and check these three conditions.

Starting with :Respondent22. Their SessionName is ""IV (VT)"", Identification is 3, Assessment is 2. Doesn't meet any criteria.

:Respondent7: SessionName ""III-Sepsis"", Identification 3, Assessment 2. No match.

:Respondent6: SessionName ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"", Identification 3, Assessment 2. Not applicable.

:Respondent20: SessionName ""IV (VT)"", Identification 3, Assessment 3. Doesn't fit.

:Respondent13: SessionName ""I-VF"", Identification 3, Assessment 2. Nope.

:Respondent14: SessionName ""IV-Hypoglycemia"", Identification 3, Assessment 3. SessionName is close but not exactly 'V (Hypoglycemia)'. Also, scores don't match.

:Respondent17: SessionName ""V (Hypoglycemia)"". That's the correct session. Now check Identification: it's 3. But we need 0. So even though the session matches, the Identification score is 3, not 0. So this respondent doesn't qualify.

:Respondent11: SessionName ""IV (AF)"", Identification 3, Assessment 3. Not matching.

:Respondent2: SessionName ""MI"", Identification 3, Assessment 3. No.

:Respondent23: SessionName ""II-Anaphylaxsis"", Identification 3, Assessment 3. Doesn't apply.

:Respondent16: SessionName ""I - MI"", Identification 3, Assessment 3. Not relevant.

:Respondent15: SessionName ""III - Sepsis"", Identification 3, Assessment 2. Doesn't meet any criteria.

After checking all respondents, none of them are in the 'V (Hypoglycemia)' session with Identification 0 and Assessment 1. The only respondent in 'V (Hypoglycemia)' is Respondent17, but their Identification is 3 and Assessment is 3. Therefore, the count is 0.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents from the 'IV (AF)' session who scored 0 on 'Background (examination)' and 2 on 'Identification'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The question is asking to count the respondents from the 'IV (AF)' session who scored 0 on 'Background (examination)' and 2 on 'Identification'. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The data has respondents with various properties, including Date, SessionName, and several scores like Identification, Background_examination, etc. 

The task involves three main criteria:
1. SessionName must be 'IV (AF)'.
2. Background_examination score is 0.
3. Identification score is 2.

Wait, the task says ""scored 0 on 'Background (examination)' and 2 on 'Identification'"". But looking at the questions, the 'Background (examination)' is mapped to the predicate pred:Background_examination. Similarly, 'Identification' is mapped to pred:Identification. 

Now, I need to go through each respondent in the data and check these three conditions. Let's list out all the respondents and their relevant properties.

Looking at the responses:

- Respondent5: SessionName ""II - Anaphylaxsis"", Background_examination 3, Identification 3. Doesn't match.
- Respondent16: SessionName ""I - MI"", Background_examination 3, Identification 3. No.
- Respondent11: SessionName ""IV (AF)"", Background_examination 3, Identification 3. Session matches, but scores are 3 and 3. Doesn't meet the 0 and 2.
- Respondent8: SessionName ""III (Sepsis)"", Background_examination 2, Identification 3. No.
- Respondent1: SessionName ""V (Hypoglycemia)"", Background_examination 2, Identification -1. No.
- Respondent9: SessionName ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"", Background_examination 2, Identification 3. No.
- Respondent13: SessionName ""I-VF"", Background_examination 1, Identification 3. No.
- Respondent20: SessionName ""IV (VT)"", Background_examination -1, Identification 3. Session is IV (VT), not AF.
- Respondent22: SessionName ""IV (VT)"", Background_examination 3, Identification 3. Also IV (VT).

Wait, the only respondent with SessionName ""IV (AF)"" is Respondent11. Let me check again. 

Looking at Respondent11's data:
- pred:SessionName ""IV (AF)""
- pred:Background_examination ""3""
- pred:Identification ""3""

So, Background_examination is 3, not 0. Identification is 3, not 2. Therefore, this respondent doesn't meet the criteria. 

Are there any other respondents with SessionName ""IV (AF)""? From the list, only Respondent11. The others with ""IV"" in their session names are Respondent20 and Respondent22, but their SessionNames are ""IV (VT)"", which is different. 

So, no respondents in the data meet all three conditions. Therefore, the count is 0.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents from the 'II-Anaphylaxsis' session who scored 0 on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 2 on 'Situation'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The goal is to count the respondents from the 'II-Anaphylaxsis' session who scored 0 on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 2 on 'Situation'. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The questions section defines each predicate. The 'Recommendation_global_rating_scale' corresponds to the GRS question, and 'Situation' is about identifying the main problem(s). 

Looking at the responses, each respondent has a pred:SessionName, pred:Recommendation_global_rating_scale, and pred:Situation. 

I need to filter respondents where:
1. SessionName is exactly 'II-Anaphylaxsis' (case-sensitive as per the data).
2. Recommendation_global_rating_scale is ""0"".
3. Situation is ""2"".

Now, let's go through each respondent:

- Respondent23: SessionName is ""II-Anaphylaxsis"". Recommendation_global_rating_scale is ""3"", Situation is ""3"". Doesn't meet.
- Respondent9: SessionName is ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"". The name here is slightly different with parentheses and spacing. The task specifies 'II-Anaphylaxsis' exactly, so this might not match. Their global rating is ""2"", Situation ""3"". Doesn't meet.
- Respondent12: SessionName is ""II (Anaphylaxis)""—note the spelling difference (Anaphylaxis vs. Anaphylaxsis). This is a different session name. So excluded.
- Other respondents have different SessionNames or dates. 

Wait, checking all responses:

Looking for SessionName ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" exactly. Only Respondent23 has that. But their scores are 3 for both. No other respondents match the exact session name. So the count is 0.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents from the 'IV (VT)' session who scored 1 on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 0 on 'Background (examination)'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents from the 'IV (VT)' session who scored 1 on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 0 on 'Background (examination)'. 

First, I need to make sure I understand the data structure. The data has a list of respondents, each with various predicates like pred:Date, pred:SessionName, and scores for different questions. The questions are defined in the schema, but the responses are in the individual respondent entries.

Let me start by identifying the relevant questions and their corresponding predicates. The task mentions two scores: 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 'Background (examination)'. 

Looking at the questions section, the 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' corresponds to :QRecommendation_global_rating_scale, which has the predicate pred:Recommendation_global_rating_scale. The rubric for this question is 0 to 3, where 0 is ""Not at all confident"" and 3 is ""Confident and required little or no questioning"". The task is looking for a score of 1 here, which according to the rubric is ""Confident but required extended questioning"".

Next, the 'Background (examination)' refers to :QBackground_examination, with the predicate pred:Background_examination. The rubric here is 0 to 3, with 0 being ""Observations are omitted or irrelevant"" and 3 being ""Comprehensive focused examination/observations"". The task wants respondents who scored 0 here.

Additionally, the session name must be 'IV (VT)'. The predicate for the session name is pred:SessionName, and the value should exactly match 'IV (VT)'. I need to check the SessionName for each respondent to see if it's 'IV (VT)'.

Now, I'll go through each respondent in the responses section and check these three conditions:

1. SessionName is 'IV (VT)'.
2. pred:Recommendation_global_rating_scale is ""1"".
3. pred:Background_examination is ""0"".

Let's list out all the respondents and their details:

- **Respondent15**: SessionName ""III - Sepsis"", Background_examination ""3"", Recommendation_global_rating_scale ""2"" → Doesn't match.
- **Respondent10**: SessionName ""(MI)-VT"", Background_examination ""2"", Recommendation_global_rating_scale ""2"" → Doesn't match.
- **Respondent6**: SessionName ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"", Background_examination ""3"", Recommendation_global_rating_scale ""3"" → Doesn't match.
- **Respondent13**: SessionName ""I-VF"", Background_examination ""1"", Recommendation_global_rating_scale ""2"" → Doesn't match.
- **Respondent17**: SessionName ""V (Hypoglycemia)"", Background_examination ""3"", Recommendation_global_rating_scale ""2"" → Doesn't match.
- **Respondent22**: SessionName ""IV (VT)"", Background_examination ""3"", Recommendation_global_rating_scale ""3"" → Session matches, but scores are 3 and 3. Doesn't meet the required scores.
- **Respondent4**: SessionName ""III (Sepsis)"", Background_examination ""2"", Recommendation_global_rating_scale ""2"" → Doesn't match.
- **Respondent18**: SessionName ""IV - VT"", Background_examination ""2"", Recommendation_global_rating_scale ""2"" → Session name is ""IV - VT"" which is slightly different from ""IV (VT)"". Also, scores are 2 and 2. Doesn't meet.

Wait, the task specifies the session name as 'IV (VT)'. Looking at the respondents, Respondent22 has SessionName ""IV (VT)"", and Respondent18 has ""IV - VT"". The hyphen vs. parentheses might be a typo, but according to the data, they are different. So only Respondent22 is in ""IV (VT)"".

Now, check Respondent22's scores: pred:Background_examination is ""3"" and pred:Recommendation_global_rating_scale is ""3"". Neither of these is 0 or 1. So no one in ""IV (VT)"" has those scores.

Are there any other respondents with SessionName that might be a variation? Let me check again. Respondent18's SessionName is ""IV - VT"", which is different. So no.

Additionally, looking for anyone with pred:Background_examination ""0"" and pred:Recommendation_global_rating_scale ""1"". Scanning through all respondents:

- Respondent13 has Background_examination ""1"" and Recommendation_global_rating_scale ""2"".
- All others have Background_examination >=1 and Recommendation_global_rating_scale >=2.

No one has Background_examination ""0"" and Recommendation_global_rating_scale ""1"", regardless of the session. But even if there were, they need to be in the 'IV (VT)' session. Since no one in that session meets the score criteria, the count is 0.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Assessment' and 'Identification' is greater than 6.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents whose total score for 'Assessment' and 'Identification' is greater than 6. 

First, I need to understand where the 'Assessment' and 'Identification' scores come from. Looking at the questions section, I see that :QAssessment and :QIdentification are the relevant entries. 

For :QIdentification, the rubric is:
0 = Requires direct prompting,
1 = Introduces themselves but only after a hint,
2 = Introduces themselves but information is incomplete,
3 = Introduces themselves and information is complete.

Similarly, :QAssessment has:
0 = No logical assessment,
1 = Assessment only after extended questioning,
2 = Assessment after minimal questioning,
3 = Comprehensive logical assessment without questioning.

Each respondent's scores for these two questions are stored under pred:Assessment and pred:Identification in the responses. The task is to sum these two scores for each respondent and count how many have a total greater than 6.

Now, let's go through each respondent in the data:

1. **Respondent20**:
   - Identification: ""3"" (3)
   - Assessment: ""3"" (3)
   - Total: 3 + 3 = 6 → Not greater than 6.

2. **Respondent8**:
   - Identification: ""3"" (3)
   - Assessment: ""2"" (2)
   - Total: 3 + 2 = 5 → No.

3. **Respondent22**:
   - Date is 2025-05-16, but we check all regardless of date.
   - Identification: ""3""
   - Assessment: ""2""
   - Total: 5 → No.

4. **Respondent5**:
   - Identification: ""3""
   - Assessment: ""3""
   - Total: 6 → No.

5. **Respondent16**:
   - Identification: ""3""
   - Assessment: ""3""
   - Total: 6 → No.

6. **Respondent23**:
   - Date is 2025-03-14.
   - Identification: ""3""
   - Assessment: ""3""
   - Total: 6 → No.

7. **Respondent15**:
   - Identification: ""3""
   - Assessment: ""2""
   - Total: 5 → No.

8. **Respondent12**:
   - Identification: ""3""
   - Assessment: ""2""
   - Total: 5 → No.

9. **Respondent7**:
   - Identification: ""3""
   - Assessment: ""2""
   - Total: 5 → No.

10. **Respondent19**:
    - Identification: ""3""
    - Assessment: ""2""
    - Total: 5 → No.

Looking at all respondents, none have a total score exceeding 6. The maximum total is 6 (3+3), which doesn't meet the ""greater than 6"" condition. Therefore, the count is 0.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Identification' and 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is greater than 5.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents whose total score for 'Identification' and 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is greater than 5. 

First, I need to make sure I understand the data structure. The questions section defines each field. The 'Identification' question has a rubric with scores from 0 to 3. Similarly, the 'Recommendation_global_rating_scale' also uses a rubric from 0 to 3. 

So, each respondent has a score for Identification and a score for Recommendation_global_rating_scale. The task is to add these two scores for each respondent and count how many have a sum greater than 5.

Let me go through each respondent in the data and calculate their total scores.

Starting with :Respondent16:
- Identification: 3
- Recommendation_global_rating_scale: 3
Total: 3 + 3 = 6. This is greater than 5, so count 1.

:Respondent18:
- Identification: 3
- Recommendation_global_rating_scale: 2
Total: 3 + 2 = 5. Not greater than 5. Doesn't count.

:Respondent7:
- Identification: 3
- Recommendation_global_rating_scale: 2
Total: 5. Doesn't count.

:Respondent8:
- Identification: 3
- Recommendation_global_rating_scale: 3
Total: 6. Count 2.

:Respondent3:
- Identification: 0
- Recommendation_global_rating_scale: 3
Total: 0 + 3 = 3. Doesn't count.

:Respondent17:
- Identification: 3
- Recommendation_global_rating_scale: 2
Total: 5. Doesn't count.

:Respondent15:
- Identification: 3
- Recommendation_global_rating_scale: 2
Total: 5. Doesn't count.

:Respondent12:
- Identification: 3
- Recommendation_global_rating_scale: 3
Total: 6. Count 3.

:Respondent2:
- Identification: 3
- Recommendation_global_rating_scale: 1
Total: 4. Doesn't count.

:Respondent10:
- Identification: 2
- Recommendation_global_rating_scale: 2
Total: 4. Doesn't count.

:Respondent22:
- Identification: 3
- Recommendation_global_rating_scale: 3
Total: 6. Count 4.

:Respondent1:
- Identification: -1 (Wait, the score here is -1. But according to the rubric for Identification, the possible scores are 0,1,2,3. Maybe this is a typo or an error. However, the problem doesn't mention handling invalid scores, so I'll take it as is.)
- Recommendation_global_rating_scale: 2
Total: -1 + 2 = 1. Doesn't count.

So, the respondents with total scores over 5 are :Respondent16, :Respondent8, :Respondent12, and :Respondent22. That's 4 respondents.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who scored 3 on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and whose 'Comments' contain the word 'Overall'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The goal is to count the respondents who scored 3 on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and have the word 'Overall' in their comments. 

First, I need to make sure I understand the data structure. The 'Recommendation_clear_recommendation' predicate corresponds to the question about making a clear recommendation, with a rubric from 0 to 3. A score of 3 means ""Clear comprehensive recommendation without questioning."" 

Next, I need to look at each respondent's data. I'll go through each one listed in the responses.

Starting with :Respondent17, their Recommendation_clear_recommendation is ""3"", which meets the score requirement. Their comments are ""Concise - clear\nSatisfactory."" No mention of 'Overall' here, so this one doesn't count.

:Respondent7 has a score of 2, so they're out.

:Respondent19 scored 3 on Recommendation_clear_recommendation. Their comments mention ""Wrong CPR position"" and ""Clarity is a bit low..."" but no 'Overall' word. Not counted.

:Respondent18 has a score of 2. Skip.

:Respondent5 has a score of 2. Not applicable.

:Respondent6's score is 2. Next.

:Respondent11 scored 3. Their comment is ""Clear communication and handover."" No 'Overall' here either.

:Respondent15 has a score of 2. Not needed.

:Respondent2's score is 2. Skip.

:Respondent23 scored 3. Their comments include ""Talking to registrav..."" and mentions Sepsis and Anaphylaxsis. Still no 'Overall'.

:Respondent4 has a score of 2. Not relevant.

Finally, :Respondent12 scored 3 on Recommendation_clear_recommendation. Their comment is just ""Good."" No 'Overall' there either.

After checking all respondents, none of those who scored 3 have 'Overall' in their comments. So the count is 0.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents from the 'I - MI' session who scored 0 on 'Identification' and 2 on 'Situation'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The question is asking to count the respondents from the 'I - MI' session who scored 0 on 'Identification' and 2 on 'Situation'. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The data has respondents with various properties like Date, SessionName, Identification, Situation, etc. Each respondent is identified by a URI like :Respondent16, :Respondent3, etc.

The task requires filtering respondents based on three criteria:
1. Their SessionName is exactly 'I - MI'.
2. Their Identification score is 0.
3. Their Situation score is 2.

I'll start by going through each respondent in the data and check these three conditions.

Looking at the list of respondents:

- **Respondent16**: 
  - SessionName: ""I - MI""
  - Identification: ""3""
  - Situation: ""3""
  Doesn't meet the criteria because Identification is 3 and Situation is 3.

- **Respondent3**:
  - SessionName: ""III-Sepsis""
  - Identification: ""0""
  - Situation: ""2""
  SessionName doesn't match 'I - MI', so excluded.

- **Respondent17**:
  - SessionName: ""V (Hypoglycemia)""
  - Doesn't match, skip.

- **Respondent15**:
  - SessionName: ""III - Sepsis""
  - Doesn't match, skip.

- **Respondent2**:
  - SessionName: ""MI""
  - Not 'I - MI', so no.

- **Respondent20**:
  - SessionName: ""IV (VT)""
  - No match.

- **Respondent5**:
  - SessionName: ""II - Anaphylaxsis""
  - Not relevant.

- **Respondent14**:
  - SessionName: ""IV-Hypoglycemia""
  - Doesn't match.

- **Respondent8**:
  - SessionName: ""III (Sepsis)""
  - Not 'I - MI'.

- **Respondent10**:
  - SessionName: ""(MI)-VT""
  - Different session name.

- **Respondent1**:
  - SessionName: ""V (Hypoglycemia)""
  - No.

- **Respondent9**:
  - SessionName: ""II (Anaphylaxsis)""
  - Not matching.

Now, checking all the respondents, the only one with SessionName ""I - MI"" is Respondent16. However, their Identification is 3 and Situation is 3, which doesn't meet the required scores of 0 and 2 respectively. 

Looking at other respondents, Respondent3 has Identification 0 and Situation 2, but their SessionName is ""III-Sepsis"", so they don't qualify. No other respondents have SessionName 'I - MI' with the specified scores. 

Therefore, there are zero respondents that meet all three criteria.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Situation' and 'Background (history)' is greater than 3.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The question is asking to count the respondents whose total score for 'Situation' and 'Background (history)' is greater than 3. 

First, I need to make sure I understand the data structure. The 'Situation' corresponds to the predicate pred:Situation, and 'Background (history)' is pred:Background_history. Each respondent has a value for these two fields.

Looking at the questions section, the 'Situation' question has a rubric where scores range from 0 to 3. Similarly, 'Background (history)' also has a rubric from 0 to 3. So each of these two fields can contribute a maximum of 3 points each. The total possible combined score would be 6 (3+3), and the minimum is 0 (0+0).

The task is to find respondents where the sum of their 'Situation' and 'Background (history)' scores is greater than 3. That means any total of 4, 5, or 6 would qualify.

Now, I need to go through each respondent in the data and check their scores for these two fields. Let's list out all the respondents and their respective scores:

- Respondent22: Situation=3, Background_history=3 → 3+3=6 → 6>3 → count
- Respondent10: Situation=2, Background_history=2 → 2+2=4 → 4>3 → count
- Respondent1: Situation=2, Background_history=2 → 4 → count
- Respondent13: Situation=3, Background_history=2 → 5 → count
- Respondent9: Situation=3, Background_history=2 → 5 → count
- Respondent21: Situation=2, Background_history=3 → 5 → count
- Respondent7: Situation=3, Background_history=2 → 5 → count
- Respondent3: Situation=2, Background_history=3 → 5 → count
- Respondent18: Situation=3, Background_history=2 → 5 → count
- Respondent17: Situation=3, Background_history=3 → 6 → count
- Respondent6: Situation=2, Background_history=3 → 5 → count

Wait, let me check each one again to be accurate:

Respondent22: 3+3=6 → yes
Respondent10: 2+2=4 → yes
Respondent1: 2+2=4 → yes
Respondent13: 3+2=5 → yes
Respondent9: 3+2=5 → yes
Respondent21: 2+3=5 → yes
Respondent7: 3+2=5 → yes
Respondent3: 2+3=5 → yes
Respondent18: 3+2=5 → yes
Respondent17: 3+3=6 → yes
Respondent6: 2+3=5 → yes

So that's 11 respondents. Wait, but let me count again:

1. Respondent22
2. Respondent10
3. Respondent1
4. Respondent13
5. Respondent9
6. Respondent21
7. Respondent7
8. Respondent3
9. Respondent18
10. Respondent17
11. Respondent6

Yes, 11 respondents. But wait, let me check if any of these have scores that sum to 3 or less. For example, is there any respondent where the sum is exactly 3 or less? Let's see:

Looking at all respondents:

- Respondent3: Situation=2, Background_history=3 → 5
- Respondent6: 2+3=5
- Respondent7: 3+2=5
- Respondent9: 3+2=5
- Respondent10: 2+2=4
- Respondent13:3+2=5
- Respondent17:3+3=6
- Respondent18:3+2=5
- Respondent21:2+3=5
- Respondent22:3+3=6
- Respondent1:2+2=4

Wait, all the respondents except maybe some others. Let me check all the respondents listed in the data. The data includes:

Respondent22, 10, 1, 13, 9, 21, 7, 3, 18, 17, 6. That's 11 respondents. Wait, but the original data in the questionnaire has 12 respondents? Let me check again.

Wait, the data in the questionnaire under responses lists:

:Respondent22, :Respondent10, :Respondent1, :Respondent13, :Respondent9, :Respondent21, :Respondent7, :Respondent3, :Respondent18, :Respondent17, :Respondent6. That's 11 respondents. Wait, the example given in the first part had 12, but the actual data here has 11. Let me recount:

1. Respondent22
2. Respondent10
3. Respondent1
4. Respondent13
5. Respondent9
6. Respondent21
7. Respondent7
8. Respondent3
9. Respondent18
10. Respondent17
11. Respondent6

Yes, 11 respondents in total. Now, each of these 11 has their Situation and Background_history scores. Let me check each one again:

- Respondent22: 3+3=6 → yes
- Respondent10: 2+2=4 → yes
- Respondent1: 2+2=4 → yes
- Respondent13:3+2=5 → yes
- Respondent9:3+2=5 → yes
- Respondent21:2+3=5 → yes
- Respondent7:3+2=5 → yes
- Respondent3:2+3=5 → yes
- Respondent18:3+2=5 → yes
- Respondent17:3+3=6 → yes
- Respondent6:2+3=5 → yes

All 11 respondents have a sum greater than 3. Wait, that can't be right. Let me check if any of them have a sum less than or equal to 3. For example, is there any respondent with Situation=0 and Background_history=0? Let's check:

Looking at each respondent's scores:

- Respondent3: Situation=2, Background_history=3 → 5
- Respondent6: 2+3=5
- Respondent7:3+2=5
- Respondent9:3+2=5
- Respondent10:2+2=4
- Respondent13:3+2=5
- Respondent17:3+3=6
- Respondent18:3+2=5
- Respondent21:2+3=5
- Respondent22:3+3=6
- Respondent1:2+2=4

So all 11 respondents have a sum of 4, 5, or 6. Therefore, all 11 would be counted. But wait, the example given in the first part had an answer of 0 for a similar question. But that was a different question (date 2025-05-02 and Background_examination=1). So in this case, the answer would be 11. But wait, that seems high. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me list each respondent's scores:

1. Respondent22: Situation=3, Background_history=3 → 6
2. Respondent10: 2+2=4
3. Respondent1: 2+2=4
4. Respondent13:3+2=5
5. Respondent9:3+2=5
6. Respondent21:2+3=5
7. Respondent7:3+2=5
8. Respondent3:2+3=5
9. Respondent18:3+2=5
10. Respondent17:3+3=6
11. Respondent6:2+3=5

Yes, all 11 have sums greater than 3. Therefore, the count is 11. But wait, the example answer was 0, but that was for a different question. So in this case, the answer should be 11. But I need to make sure I didn't miss any respondents. Let me check again the list of respondents in the data provided. The data under the questionnaire section lists 11 respondents. All of them have sums greater than 3. Therefore, the answer is 11.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose 'Identification' is higher than the average 'Identification' for all sessions on the same date.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents whose 'Identification' score is higher than the average 'Identification' score for all sessions on the same date. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The 'Identification' question has a rubric where scores range from 0 to 3. Each respondent has a 'Date' and an 'Identification' score. 

So, the plan is:
1. Group all respondents by their 'Date'.
2. For each date, calculate the average 'Identification' score.
3. For each respondent, compare their 'Identification' score to the average of their group (same date).
4. Count how many respondents have a score higher than their group's average.

Let's look at the data. The respondents are:

- Respondent18: Date 2025-05-04, Identification 3
- Respondent2: Date 2025-04-04, Identification 3
- Respondent3: Date 2025-04-04, Identification 0
- Respondent16: Date 2025-05-02, Identification 3
- Respondent22: Date 2025-05-16, Identification 3
- Respondent10: Date 2025-03-14, Identification 2
- Respondent14: Date 2025-03-14, Identification 3
- Respondent6: Date 2025-04-04, Identification 3

Now, group by date:

2025-05-04: [3] → Average = 3
2025-04-04: [3, 0, 3] → Sum = 6, Average = 2
2025-05-02: [3] → Average =3
2025-05-16: [3] → Average=3
2025-03-14: [2,3] → Sum=5, Average=2.5
Others (like 2025-05-16) have only one respondent.

Now, check each respondent against their date's average:

- Respondent18: 3 vs 3 → not higher. So no.
- Respondent2: 3 vs 2 → higher. Yes.
- Respondent3: 0 vs 2 → no.
- Respondent16: 3 vs 3 → no.
- Respondent22: 3 vs 3 → no.
- Respondent10: 2 vs 2.5 → 2 < 2.5 → no.
- Respondent14: 3 vs 2.5 → yes.
- Respondent6: 3 vs 2 → yes.

So, the respondents with scores higher than their date's average are Respondent2, Respondent14, and Respondent6. That's 3 people.

Wait, let me double-check:

For 2025-04-04, average is (3+0+3)/3 = 2. So Respondent2 (3) and Respondent6 (3) are both higher. Respondent3 (0) is lower. So two here.

For 2025-03-14: average 2.5. Respondent10 has 2 (lower), Respondent14 has 3 (higher). So one here.

Others: no.

So total is 2 (from 2025-04-04) + 1 (from 2025-03-14) = 3.

Yes, that's correct. So the answer should be 3.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score across all rubric items is below the average total score for all sessions.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The goal is to count the number of respondents whose total score across all rubric items is below the average total score for all sessions. 

First, I need to understand which predicates in the responses are rubric items that contribute to the total score. Looking at the questions section, the rubric items are the ones with the ""[Rubric: ...]"" descriptions. These are:

- QIdentification (0-3)
- QSituation (0-3)
- QBackground_history (0-3)
- QBackground_examination (0-3)
- QAssessment (0-3)
- QRecommendation_clear_recommendation (0-3)
- QRecommendation_global_rating_scale (0-3)

So each respondent has seven rubric items, each scored from 0 to 3. The total score for each respondent would be the sum of these seven scores.

Next, I need to go through each respondent in the responses and calculate their total scores. Let's list them out:

**Respondent21:**
- Identification: 3
- Situation: 2
- Background_history: 3
- Background_examination: 1
- Assessment: 2
- Recommendation_clear_recommendation: 3
- Recommendation_global_rating_scale: 3
Total = 3+2+3+1+2+3+3 = 17

**Respondent23:**
- All scores: 3,3,2,2,3,3,3
Total = 3+3+2+2+3+3+3 = 19

**Respondent14:**
- Scores: 3,3,2,2,3,1,2
Total = 3+3+2+2+3+1+2 = 16

**Respondent12:**
- Scores: 3,3,3,3,2,3,3
Total = 3+3+3+3+2+3+3 = 20

**Respondent13:**
- Scores: 3,3,2,1,2,2,2
Total = 3+3+2+1+2+2+2 = 15

**Respondent15:**
- Scores: 3,3,2,3,2,2,2
Total = 3+3+2+3+2+2+2 = 17

**Respondent19:**
- Scores: 3,3,3,3,2,3,3
Total = 3+3+3+3+2+3+3 = 20

**Respondent17:**
- Scores: 3,3,3,3,3,3,2
Total = 3+3+3+3+3+3+2 = 20

**Respondent2:**
- Scores: 3,3,2,3,3,2,1
Total = 3+3+2+3+3+2+1 = 17

Now, let's list all the totals:
17, 19, 16, 20, 15, 17, 20, 20, 17

Next, calculate the average total score. First, sum all the totals:

17 + 19 = 36
36 +16=52
52+20=72
72+15=87
87+17=104
104+20=124
124+20=144
144+17=161

There are 9 respondents. So the average is 161 / 9 ≈ 17.888...

So the average total score is approximately 17.89. Now, we need to find how many respondents have a total below this average. Let's check each:

- Respondent21: 17 (17 < 17.89 → yes)
- Respondent23: 19 (no)
- Respondent14:16 (yes)
- Respondent12:20 (no)
- Respondent13:15 (yes)
- Respondent15:17 (yes)
- Respondent19:20 (no)
- Respondent17:20 (no)
- Respondent2:17 (yes)

So respondents 21,14,13,15,2 have totals below 17.89. That's 5 respondents. Wait, let me recount:

Looking at the totals:

17 (21) → yes
19 → no
16 (14) → yes
20 → no
15 (13) → yes
17 (15) → yes
20 → no
20 → no
17 (2) → yes

That's 1 (21) +1 (14) +1 (13) +1 (15) +1 (2) = 5 respondents. But wait, the totals for Respondent15 is 17, which is below 17.89. Respondent2 is 17, also below. So total of 5.

But wait, let me check the calculations again. The sum was 161, divided by 9 is 17.888... So 17.89. Any total less than that would be 17 or lower. So 17 is below the average. So:

Respondent21:17 → yes
Respondent14:16 → yes
Respondent13:15 → yes
Respondent15:17 → yes
Respondent2:17 → yes

That's 5 respondents. But wait, the totals for Respondent15 and Respondent2 are both 17, which is less than 17.89. So total of 5. But let me check each total again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in adding.

Wait, let's recheck the totals:

Respondent21: 3+2+3+1+2+3+3 = 17 ✅

Respondent23:3+3+2+2+3+3+3=19 ✅

Respondent14:3+3+2+2+3+1+2=16 ✅

Respondent12:3+3+3+3+2+3+3=20 ✅

Respondent13:3+3+2+1+2+2+2=15 ✅

Respondent15:3+3+2+3+2+2+2=17 ✅

Respondent19:3+3+3+3+2+3+3=20 ✅

Respondent17:3+3+3+3+3+3+2=20 ✅

Respondent2:3+3+2+3+3+2+1=17 ✅

Yes, all totals are correct. So the average is 161/9 ≈17.89. So any total less than 17.89 is 17 or lower. So the respondents with totals 15,16,17. Wait, 17 is less than 17.89. So all 17s are included. So how many have totals below 17.89?

Looking at the list:

17,19,16,20,15,17,20,20,17

Numbers below 17.89 are 15,16,17. So:

- 15: 1 (Respondent13)
- 16:1 (Respondent14)
- 17:3 (Respondent21, Respondent15, Respondent2)

Total of 1+1+3=5 respondents.

So the answer should be 5. But wait, the example given in the problem had an answer of 0, but that was for a different question. Let me make sure I didn't mix up anything.

Wait, the task here is to count the respondents whose total is below the average. The example was about a different question (date 2025-05-02 and score 1 on Background_examination, which had answer 0). So in this case, the answer should be 5. But let me check again.

Wait, the average is 17.89. So any total less than that. 17 is less than 17.89. So all 17s are included. So 5 respondents. But let me check the list again:

Respondent21:17 → yes

Respondent14:16 → yes

Respondent13:15 → yes

Respondent15:17 → yes

Respondent2:17 → yes

That's 5. So the answer is 5.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose 'Background (examination)' score is equal to the average 'Background (examination)' score for all sessions that occurred on the same date.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents whose 'Background (examination)' score is equal to the average 'Background (examination)' score for all sessions that occurred on the same date. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The data provided includes multiple respondents, each with a date and a score for 'Background_examination'. The 'Background_examination' is a rubric-based score, but for this task, the actual rubric details might not be necessary since we're dealing with numerical values.

The steps I need to follow are:

1. **Group respondents by their session dates.** For each date, calculate the average 'Background_examination' score.
2. **For each respondent, compare their 'Background_examination' score to the average of their respective date group.**
3. **Count how many respondents have a score equal to the average of their group.**

Let's start by listing all the respondents along with their dates and Background_examination scores:

- **Respondent5**: Date 2025-05-04, Score 3
- **Respondent21**: Date 2025-05-16, Score 1
- **Respondent12**: Date 2025-05-02, Score 3
- **Respondent4**: Date 2025-05-16, Score 2
- **Respondent6**: Date 2025-04-04, Score 3
- **Respondent18**: Date 2025-05-04, Score 2
- **Respondent13**: Date 2025-03-14, Score 1
- **Respondent23**: Date 2025-03-14, Score 2
- **Respondent22**: Date 2025-05-16, Score 3
- **Respondent20**: Date 2025-05-02, Score -1
- **Respondent1**: Date 2025-05-02, Score 2
- **Respondent17**: Date 2025-05-04, Score 3

Now, let's group them by date and calculate the average for each group:

**Group 2025-03-14**:
- Respondent13: 1
- Respondent23: 2
Average = (1 + 2) / 2 = 1.5

**Group 2025-04-04**:
- Respondent6: 3
Average = 3 (only one respondent)

**Group 2025-05-02**:
- Respondent12: 3
- Respondent20: -1
- Respondent1: 2
Total = 3 + (-1) + 2 = 4; Average = 4 / 3 ≈ 1.333...

**Group 2025-05-04**:
- Respondent5: 3
- Respondent18: 2
- Respondent17: 3
Total = 3 + 2 + 3 = 8; Average = 8 / 3 ≈ 2.666...

**Group 2025-05-16**:
- Respondent21: 1
- Respondent4: 2
- Respondent22: 3
Total = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6; Average = 6 / 3 = 2

Now, for each respondent, check if their score equals the average of their date group:

- **Respondent5 (2025-05-04)**: Score 3 vs. average ~2.666 → Not equal.
- **Respondent21 (2025-05-16)**: Score 1 vs. average 2 → Not equal.
- **Respondent12 (2025-05-02)**: Score 3 vs. average ~1.333 → Not equal.
- **Respondent4 (2025-05-16)**: Score 2 vs. average 2 → Equal. **Count +1**
- **Respondent6 (2025-04-04)**: Score 3 vs. average 3 → Equal. **Count +1**
- **Respondent18 (2025-05-04)**: Score 2 vs. average ~2.666 → Not equal.
- **Respondent13 (2025-03-14)**: Score 1 vs. average 1.5 → Not equal.
- **Respondent23 (2025-03-14)**: Score 2 vs. average 1.5 → Not equal.
- **Respondent22 (2025-05-16)**: Score 3 vs. average 2 → Not equal.
- **Respondent20 (2025-05-02)**: Score -1 vs. average ~1.333 → Not equal.
- **Respondent1 (2025-05-02)**: Score 2 vs. average ~1.333 → Not equal.
- **Respondent17 (2025-05-04)**: Score 3 vs. average ~2.666 → Not equal.

So, the respondents who meet the criteria are Respondent4 and Respondent6. That's a total of 2.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who participated in a session where the average 'Assessment' for that session name is greater than 1.5.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents who participated in a session where the average 'Assessment' score for that session name is greater than 1.5. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The responses are individual respondents, each with a SessionName and an Assessment score. The Assessment score is a numerical value (0-3) based on the rubric provided. 

The key here is to group the respondents by their SessionName, calculate the average Assessment score for each session, and then count how many respondents are in sessions where that average is above 1.5.

Let me start by listing all the respondents along with their SessionName and Assessment scores:

- Respondent15: SessionName ""III - Sepsis"", Assessment 2
- Respondent22: SessionName ""IV (VT)"", Assessment 2
- Respondent18: SessionName ""IV - VT"", Assessment 3
- Respondent14: SessionName ""IV-Hypoglycemia"", Assessment 3
- Respondent21: SessionName ""I (Myocardial infarction)"", Assessment 2
- Respondent13: SessionName ""I-VF"", Assessment 2
- Respondent8: SessionName ""III (Sepsis)"", Assessment 2
- Respondent17: SessionName ""V (Hypoglycemia)"", Assessment 3
- Respondent16: SessionName ""I - MI"", Assessment 3
- Respondent6: SessionName ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"", Assessment 2

Now, I need to group these by SessionName. However, I notice that some SessionNames might be the same but written differently. For example, ""III - Sepsis"" and ""III (Sepsis)"" could be considered the same session. Similarly, ""IV (VT)"" and ""IV - VT"" might be the same. Let me check the exact SessionNames:

Looking at the data:

- ""III - Sepsis"" (Respondent15)
- ""III (Sepsis)"" (Respondent8)
- ""IV (VT)"" (Respondent22)
- ""IV - VT"" (Respondent18)
- ""IV-Hypoglycemia"" (Respondent14)
- ""I (Myocardial infarction)"" (Respondent21)
- ""I-VF"" (Respondent13)
- ""V (Hypoglycemia)"" (Respondent17)
- ""I - MI"" (Respondent16)
- ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"" (Respondent6)

Hmm, some of these might be different sessions. For instance, ""III - Sepsis"" and ""III (Sepsis)"" could be the same session but written with different punctuation. Similarly, ""IV (VT)"" and ""IV - VT"" might be the same. However, without explicit confirmation that these are the same sessions, I should treat them as distinct because the names are slightly different. The problem doesn't mention normalizing session names, so I have to take them as they are.

So, each unique SessionName is considered a separate session. Now, let's list each session and calculate the average Assessment score:

1. Session ""III - Sepsis"": Only Respondent15 with Assessment 2. Average = 2.0
2. Session ""IV (VT)"": Respondent22 with Assessment 2. Average = 2.0
3. Session ""IV - VT"": Respondent18 with Assessment 3. Average = 3.0
4. Session ""IV-Hypoglycemia"": Respondent14 with Assessment 3. Average = 3.0
5. Session ""I (Myocardial infarction)"": Respondent21 with Assessment 2. Average = 2.0
6. Session ""I-VF"": Respondent13 with Assessment 2. Average = 2.0
7. Session ""III (Sepsis)"": Respondent8 with Assessment 2. Average = 2.0
8. Session ""V (Hypoglycemia)"": Respondent17 with Assessment 3. Average = 3.0
9. Session ""I - MI"": Respondent16 with Assessment 3. Average = 3.0
10. Session ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"": Respondent6 with Assessment 2. Average = 2.0

Now, check which sessions have an average Assessment greater than 1.5. All the averages calculated are 2.0 or higher, which is greater than 1.5. So every session meets the criteria. 

Therefore, all respondents are part of sessions where the average Assessment is above 1.5. Let's count the total number of respondents. There are 10 respondents listed. 

Wait, but looking back at the data, the example answer was 0 for a different question. But in this case, all sessions have averages of 2.0 or 3.0, which are all above 1.5. So the count should be 10. But let me double-check each session's average:

- ""III - Sepsis"": 2.0 >1.5 → yes
- ""IV (VT)"": 2.0 → yes
- ""IV - VT"": 3.0 → yes
- ""IV-Hypoglycemia"": 3.0 → yes
- ""I (Myocardial infarction)"": 2.0 → yes
- ""I-VF"": 2.0 → yes
- ""III (Sepsis)"": 2.0 → yes
- ""V (Hypoglycemia)"": 3.0 → yes
- ""I - MI"": 3.0 → yes
- ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"": 2.0 → yes

All sessions qualify. Therefore, all 10 respondents should be counted. But wait, looking at the data again, the respondents are from Respondent6,8,13,14,15,16,17,18,21,22. That's 10 respondents. So the answer should be 10. But let me check again if I missed any.

Wait, the data provided in the questionnaire has 10 respondents. Each is part of a session with average >1.5. So the count is 10. But maybe I made a mistake in grouping. Let me recheck:

Each session is unique as per their names. For example, ""III - Sepsis"" and ""III (Sepsis)"" are different session names, so they are separate sessions. Each has one respondent. So each of those sessions has an average of 2.0. Similarly, ""IV (VT)"" and ""IV - VT"" are different names, so separate sessions. Each has one respondent with 2 and 3 respectively. So their averages are 2 and 3. Both are above 1.5. So all sessions meet the criteria, so all respondents are counted. Therefore, the total is 10.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose 'Background (examination)' is higher than the average 'Background (examination)' for all sessions on the same date.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents whose 'Background (examination)' score is higher than the average 'Background (examination)' score for all sessions on the same date. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The 'Background_examination' predicate in the responses corresponds to the question ""Gives appropriate examination/observations"" with a rubric from 0 to 3. Each respondent has a date and a score for this category.

The steps I need to follow are:

1. **Group respondents by date**: For each date, calculate the average Background_examination score.
2. **Compare each respondent's score**: For each respondent, check if their score is higher than the average of their respective date group.
3. **Count the number of such respondents**.

Let's start by extracting all the respondents and their Background_examination scores along with the dates.

Looking at the responses:

- **Respondent9**: Date 2025-05-04, Score 2
- **Respondent7**: 2025-03-14, 3
- **Respondent4**: 2025-05-16, 2
- **Respondent2**: 2025-04-04, 3
- **Respondent14**: 2025-03-14, 2
- **Respondent1**: 2025-05-02, 2
- **Respondent8**: 2025-05-02, 2
- **Respondent22**: 2025-05-16, 3
- **Respondent20**: 2025-05-02, -1 (Note: Negative score, but according to the rubric, scores are 0-3. Maybe an error, but we'll consider it as given.)

Now, group by date and calculate averages:

**2025-03-14**:
- Respondent7: 3
- Respondent14: 2
Average = (3 + 2)/2 = 2.5

**2025-04-04**:
- Respondent2: 3
Average = 3 (only one respondent)

**2025-05-02**:
- Respondent1: 2
- Respondent8: 2
- Respondent20: -1
Average = (2 + 2 + (-1))/3 = 3/3 = 1

**2025-05-04**:
- Respondent9: 2
Average = 2

**2025-05-16**:
- Respondent4: 2
- Respondent22: 3
Average = (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5

Now, compare each respondent's score to their date's average:

- **Respondent9 (2025-05-04, 2)**: 2 vs 2 → Not higher. So no.
- **Respondent7 (2025-03-14, 3)**: 3 vs 2.5 → Yes.
- **Respondent4 (2025-05-16, 2)**: 2 vs 2.5 → No.
- **Respondent2 (2025-04-04, 3)**: 3 vs 3 → Equal, not higher. No.
- **Respondent14 (2025-03-14, 2)**: 2 vs 2.5 → No.
- **Respondent1 (2025-05-02, 2)**: 2 vs 1 → Yes.
- **Respondent8 (2025-05-02, 2)**: 2 vs 1 → Yes.
- **Respondent22 (2025-05-16, 3)**: 3 vs 2.5 → Yes.
- **Respondent20 (2025-05-02, -1)**: -1 vs 1 → No.

So the respondents with scores higher than their date's average are Respondent7, Respondent1, Respondent8, and Respondent22. That's 4 respondents. Wait, let me check again:

Wait, Respondent20's score is -1, which is below the average of 1 for 2025-05-02. So Respondent1 and Respondent8 on 2025-05-02 have scores of 2, which is higher than 1. So that's two there. Respondent7 (3 vs 2.5) and Respondent22 (3 vs 2.5). So total of 4. But wait, let me recount:

- Respondent7: Yes (1)
- Respondent1: Yes (2)
- Respondent8: Yes (3)
- Respondent22: Yes (4)
Total 4.

But wait, the answer in the example was 0 for a similar question. But that was a different question (scored 1 on that date). So in this case, the correct answer here is 4? Let me verify each date again.

For 2025-03-14: average 2.5. Respondent7 has 3 (higher), Respondent14 has 2 (lower). So 1.

2025-04-04: average 3. Respondent2 has 3 (equal, not higher). So 0.

2025-05-02: average 1. Respondents 1 and 8 have 2 (higher), Respondent20 has -1 (lower). So 2.

2025-05-04: average 2. Respondent9 has 2 (equal). 0.

2025-05-16: average 2.5. Respondent4 has 2 (lower), Respondent22 has 3 (higher). So 1.

Total: 1 (from 2025-03-14) + 2 (2025-05-02) + 1 (2025-05-16) = 4.

But wait, the answer should be 4. However, let me check if the scores are numeric. The rubric for Background_examination is 0-3. The responses have scores like ""2"", ""3"", ""-1"". The -1 might be an error, but according to the data, we have to take it as is. So in the calculation for 2025-05-02, the average is (2 + 2 + (-1))/3 = 3/3 = 1. So 2 is higher than 1. So yes, those two count. So total 4.

Therefore, the answer is 4.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who participated in a session where the average 'Assessment' for that session name is greater than 2.0.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents who participated in a session where the average 'Assessment' score for that session name is greater than 2.0. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The responses are individual respondents, each with a 'pred:Assessment' value and a 'pred:SessionName'. The goal is to group respondents by their SessionName, calculate the average Assessment score for each session, and then count how many respondents are in sessions where that average is above 2.0.

Let me start by listing all the respondents and their corresponding SessionName and Assessment scores.

Looking at the data:

- Respondent20: SessionName ""IV (VT)"", Assessment 3
- Respondent2: SessionName ""MI"", Assessment 3
- Respondent15: SessionName ""III - Sepsis"", Assessment 2
- Respondent23: SessionName ""II-Anaphylaxsis"", Assessment 3
- Respondent22: SessionName ""IV (VT)"", Assessment 2
- Respondent8: SessionName ""III (Sepsis)"", Assessment 2
- Respondent19: SessionName ""I - MI"", Assessment 2
- Respondent13: SessionName ""I-VF"", Assessment 2

Wait, I need to check each respondent's Assessment and SessionName. Let me list them again more carefully:

1. Respondent20: Session ""IV (VT)"", Assessment 3
2. Respondent2: Session ""MI"", Assessment 3
3. Respondent15: Session ""III - Sepsis"", Assessment 2
4. Respondent23: Session ""II-Anaphylaxsis"", Assessment 3
5. Respondent22: Session ""IV (VT)"", Assessment 2
6. Respondent8: Session ""III (Sepsis)"", Assessment 2
7. Respondent19: Session ""I - MI"", Assessment 2
8. Respondent13: Session ""I-VF"", Assessment 2

Now, group by SessionName and calculate the average Assessment for each:

- IV (VT): Respondents20 (3) and 22 (2). Average = (3 + 2)/2 = 2.5
- MI: Respondent2 (3). Average = 3.0
- III - Sepsis: Respondent15 (2). Average = 2.0
- II-Anaphylaxsis: Respondent23 (3). Average = 3.0
- III (Sepsis): Respondent8 (2). Average = 2.0
- I - MI: Respondent19 (2). Average = 2.0
- I-VF: Respondent13 (2). Average = 2.0

Wait, but the problem states sessions where the average is greater than 2.0. So, which sessions meet that?

Looking at the averages:

- IV (VT): 2.5 > 2.0 → yes
- MI: 3.0 > 2.0 → yes
- II-Anaphylaxsis: 3.0 > 2.0 → yes

The other sessions (III - Sepsis, III (Sepsis), I - MI, I-VF) have averages of exactly 2.0 or less, so they don't qualify.

Now, count the number of respondents in those qualifying sessions:

- IV (VT): 2 respondents (20 and 22)
- MI: 1 respondent (2)
- II-Anaphylaxsis: 1 respondent (23)

Total respondents = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4.

Wait, but let me double-check. Are there any other sessions? Let me list all session names again:

- IV (VT)
- MI
- III - Sepsis
- II-Anaphylaxsis
- III (Sepsis)
- I - MI
- I-VF

Yes. So the qualifying sessions are IV (VT), MI, and II-Anaphylaxsis. Their respondents are:

IV (VT): 2
MI: 1
II-Anaphylaxsis: 1

Total 4 respondents. Therefore, the answer should be 4.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score across all rubric items is below the average total score for all sessions.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents whose total score across all rubric items is below the average total score for all sessions. 

First, I need to understand which predicates in the data correspond to rubric items. Looking at the questions section, the rubric items are the ones with a rubric scale from 0 to 3. These are:

- Identification (pred:Identification)
- Situation (pred:Situation)
- Background_history (pred:Background_history)
- Background_examination (pred:Background_examination)
- Assessment (pred:Assessment)
- Recommendation_clear_recommendation (pred:Recommendation_clear_recommendation)
- Recommendation_global_rating_scale (pred:Recommendation_global_rating_scale)

Each of these has a rubric, so their scores are part of the total. The other questions (Date, SessionName, Comments) are open-ended and not scored, so they don't contribute to the total.

Next, I need to calculate the total score for each respondent by summing the values of these seven rubric items. Then, compute the average total score across all respondents. Finally, count how many respondents have a total score below this average.

Let's start by listing all respondents and their scores. Each respondent has values for the seven rubric items. I'll go through each one and sum their scores.

Looking at the responses:

1. **Respondent8**:
   - Identification: 3
   - Situation: 3
   - Background_history: 3
   - Background_examination: 2
   - Assessment: 2
   - Recommendation_clear_recommendation: 2
   - Recommendation_global_rating_scale: 3
   Total = 3+3+3+2+2+2+3 = 18

2. **Respondent18**:
   - All rubric items: 3,3,2,2,3,2,2
   Total = 3+3+2+2+3+2+2 = 17

3. **Respondent7**:
   - Scores: 3,3,2,3,2,2,2
   Total = 3+3+2+3+2+2+2 = 17

4. **Respondent2**:
   - Scores: 3,3,2,3,3,2,1
   Total = 3+3+2+3+3+2+1 = 17

5. **Respondent5**:
   - All 3s except Recommendation_clear_recommendation (2) and GRS (3)
   Total = 3+3+3+3+3+2+3 = 20

6. **Respondent17**:
   - All 3s except Recommendation_clear_recommendation (3) and GRS (2)
   Wait, let's check:
   Identification:3, Situation:3, Background_history:3, Background_examination:3, Assessment:3, Recommendation_clear_recommendation:3, GRS:2
   Total = 3+3+3+3+3+3+2 = 20

7. **Respondent10**:
   - Scores: 2,2,2,2,2,2,2
   Total = 2*7 =14

8. **Respondent23**:
   - Identification:3, Situation:3, Background_history:2, Background_examination:2, Assessment:3, Recommendation_clear_recommendation:3, GRS:3
   Total = 3+3+2+2+3+3+3 = 19

9. **Respondent14**:
   - Scores:3,3,2,2,3,1,2
   Total = 3+3+2+2+3+1+2 = 16

10. **Respondent12**:
    - All 3s except Assessment (2) and Recommendation_clear_recommendation (3), GRS (3)
    Wait: Identification:3, Situation:3, Background_history:3, Background_examination:3, Assessment:2, Recommendation_clear_recommendation:3, GRS:3
    Total = 3+3+3+3+2+3+3 = 20

11. **Respondent22**:
    - Scores:3,3,3,3,2,2,3
    Total = 3+3+3+3+2+2+3 = 19

Now, let's list all totals:

- Respondent8: 18
- Respondent18:17
- Respondent7:17
- Respondent2:17
- Respondent5:20
- Respondent17:20
- Respondent10:14
- Respondent23:19
- Respondent14:16
- Respondent12:20
- Respondent22:19

Now, calculate the average total score. Sum all these totals and divide by 11 (number of respondents).

Sum = 18 +17+17+17+20+20+14+19+16+20+19 = Let's compute step by step:

18+17=35; 35+17=52; 52+17=69; 69+20=89; 89+20=109; 109+14=123; 123+19=142; 142+16=158; 158+20=178; 178+19=197.

Total sum = 197. Number of respondents =11. Average = 197 /11 ≈17.909, which is approximately 17.91.

Now, we need to count how many respondents have a total score below this average. Since the average is ~17.91, scores below 17.91 are 17, 16, 14.

Looking at the totals:

- Respondent18:17 (17 <17.91 → yes)
- Respondent7:17 (yes)
- Respondent2:17 (yes)
- Respondent10:14 (yes)
- Respondent14:16 (yes)

Wait, let's check each:

- Respondent8:18 → 18 >17.91 → no
- Respondent18:17 → yes
- Respondent7:17 → yes
- Respondent2:17 → yes
- Respondent5:20 → no
- Respondent17:20 → no
- Respondent10:14 → yes
- Respondent23:19 → no
- Respondent14:16 → yes
- Respondent12:20 → no
- Respondent22:19 → no

So that's 5 respondents: 18,7,2,10,14. Wait, but their totals are 17,17,17,14,16. So 17 is below 17.91? 17 is less than 17.91, yes. So each of these 5 have scores below average.

Wait, how many are there?

Respondent18:17 → yes (1)
Respondent7:17 → yes (2)
Respondent2:17 → yes (3)
Respondent10:14 → yes (4)
Respondent14:16 → yes (5)

So total of 5 respondents. But wait, let me check the totals again to make sure I didn't miss any.

Wait, the sum was 197, average 17.909. So any total of 17 or below is below average. Wait, 17 is less than 17.909, so yes. So all respondents with 17,16,14 are below. Let's recount:

Looking at the list:

- Respondent8:18 → no
- Respondent18:17 → yes (1)
- Respondent7:17 → yes (2)
- Respondent2:17 → yes (3)
- Respondent5:20 → no
- Respondent17:20 → no
- Respondent10:14 → yes (4)
- Respondent23:19 → no
- Respondent14:16 → yes (5)
- Respondent12:20 → no
- Respondent22:19 → no

Total of 5 respondents. So the answer should be 5. But wait, let me check the calculations again to ensure I didn't make a mistake in adding the totals.

Wait, let's recheck the totals for each respondent:

Respondent8: 3+3+3+2+2+2+3 = 18 ✔️

Respondent18:3+3+2+2+3+2+2= 3+3=6, +2=8, +2=10, +3=13, +2=15, +2=17 ✔️

Respondent7:3+3+2+3+2+2+2=3+3=6+2=8+3=11+2=13+2=15+2=17 ✔️

Respondent2:3+3+2+3+3+2+1=3+3=6+2=8+3=11+3=14+2=16+1=17 ✔️

Respondent5:3+3+3+3+3+2+3=3*5=15 +2+3=20 ✔️

Respondent17:3+3+3+3+3+3+2=3*6=18 +2=20 ✔️

Respondent10:2+2+2+2+2+2+2=14 ✔️

Respondent23:3+3+2+2+3+3+3=3+3=6+2=8+2=10+3=13+3=16+3=19 ✔️

Respondent14:3+3+2+2+3+1+2=3+3=6+2=8+2=10+3=13+1=14+2=16 ✔️

Respondent12:3+3+3+3+2+3+3=3+3=6+3=9+3=12+2=14+3=17+3=20 ✔️

Respondent22:3+3+3+3+2+2+3=3+3=6+3=9+3=12+2=14+2=16+3=19 ✔️

So the totals are correct. The sum is indeed 197, average ≈17.91. So any total below 17.91 is 17 and below. So 17,16,14. 

Now, how many respondents have totals below 17.91?

Looking at the list:

- 17: Respondent18, Respondent7, Respondent2 (3 respondents)
- 16: Respondent14 (1)
- 14: Respondent10 (1)

Total of 3 +1 +1 =5 respondents. 

Therefore, the answer should be 5. But wait, the example given in the problem had an answer of 0, but that was for a different question. So in this case, the correct answer is 5.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose 'Assessment' is higher than the average 'Assessment' for all sessions on the same date.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents whose 'Assessment' score is higher than the average 'Assessment' for all sessions on the same date. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The 'Assessment' question is defined with a rubric from 0 to 3. Each respondent has a 'Date' and an 'Assessment' score. 

So, the plan is:
1. For each respondent, note their date and assessment score.
2. For each date, calculate the average assessment score of all respondents from that date.
3. Compare each respondent's assessment score to the average of their respective date.
4. Count how many respondents have a score higher than their date's average.

Let's start by listing all respondents with their dates and assessment scores:

- Respondent19: 2025-05-16, Assessment 2
- Respondent20: 2025-05-02, Assessment 3
- Respondent11: 2025-04-04, Assessment 3
- Respondent8: 2025-05-02, Assessment 2
- Respondent10: 2025-03-14, Assessment 2
- Respondent5: 2025-05-04, Assessment 3
- Respondent17: 2025-05-04, Assessment 3
- Respondent22: 2025-05-16, Assessment 2
- Respondent7: 2025-03-14, Assessment 2
- Respondent18: 2025-05-04, Assessment 3

Now, group them by date:

2025-03-14:
- Respondent10: 2
- Respondent7: 2
Average = (2 + 2)/2 = 2.0

2025-04-04:
- Respondent11: 3
Average = 3.0

2025-05-02:
- Respondent20: 3
- Respondent8: 2
Average = (3 + 2)/2 = 2.5

2025-05-04:
- Respondent5: 3
- Respondent17: 3
- Respondent18: 3
Average = (3 + 3 + 3)/3 = 3.0

2025-05-16:
- Respondent19: 2
- Respondent22: 2
Average = (2 + 2)/2 = 2.0

Now, compare each respondent's assessment to their date's average:

2025-03-14 (avg 2.0):
- Respondent10: 2 → not higher
- Respondent7: 2 → not higher

2025-04-04 (avg 3.0):
- Respondent11: 3 → equal, not higher

2025-05-02 (avg 2.5):
- Respondent20: 3 → higher
- Respondent8: 2 → lower

2025-05-04 (avg 3.0):
- Respondent5: 3 → equal
- Respondent17: 3 → equal
- Respondent18: 3 → equal

2025-05-16 (avg 2.0):
- Respondent19: 2 → equal
- Respondent22: 2 → equal

Only Respondent20 (3 > 2.5) has a score higher than the date's average. So the count is 1.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' score is equal to the average 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' score for all sessions that occurred on the same date.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents whose 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' score is equal to the average of that score for all sessions on the same date. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The 'Recommendation_clear_recommendation' predicate holds the scores for each respondent. Each respondent also has a 'Date' attribute indicating when their session occurred.

So, the plan is:
1. Calculate the average 'Recommendation_clear_recommendation' score for each date.
2. For each respondent, check if their score matches the average of their session's date.
3. Count how many such respondents exist.

Let me start by listing all the respondents and their dates and scores. Let's go through each respondent in the data:

- Respondent2: Date 2025-04-04, Score 2
- Respondent18: 2025-05-04, Score 2
- Respondent19: 2025-05-16, Score 3
- Respondent6: 2025-04-04, Score 2
- Respondent14: 2025-03-14, Score 1
- Respondent22: 2025-05-16, Score 2
- Respondent16: 2025-05-02, Score 2
- Respondent23: 2025-03-14, Score 3
- Respondent20: 2025-05-02, Score 2
- Respondent11: 2025-04-04, Score 3

Now, group them by date and calculate the average for each group:

1. 2025-03-14:
   - Respondents: 14 (Score 1), 23 (Score 3)
   - Total = 1 + 3 = 4
   - Count = 2
   - Average = 4 / 2 = 2.0

2. 2025-04-04:
   - Respondents: 2 (2), 6 (2), 11 (3)
   - Total = 2 + 2 + 3 = 7
   - Count = 3
   - Average = 7 / 3 ≈ 2.333...

3. 2025-05-02:
   - Respondents: 16 (2), 20 (2)
   - Total = 2 + 2 = 4
   - Count = 2
   - Average = 4 / 2 = 2.0

4. 2025-05-04:
   - Respondent18: Score 2
   - Average = 2 (only one respondent)

5. 2025-05-16:
   - Respondents: 19 (3), 22 (2)
   - Total = 3 + 2 = 5
   - Count = 2
   - Average = 5 / 2 = 2.5

Now, check each respondent's score against their date's average:

- Respondent2 (2025-04-04, 2): Average is ~2.333. 2 ≠ 2.333 → No
- Respondent18 (2025-05-04, 2): Average is 2 → Yes
- Respondent19 (2025-05-16, 3): Average 2.5 → 3 ≠ 2.5 → No
- Respondent6 (2025-04-04, 2): 2 ≠ 2.333 → No
- Respondent14 (2025-03-14, 1): Average 2 → 1 ≠ 2 → No
- Respondent22 (2025-05-16, 2): 2.5 average → 2 ≠ 2.5 → No
- Respondent16 (2025-05-02, 2): Average 2 → Yes
- Respondent23 (2025-03-14, 3): Average 2 → 3 ≠ 2 → No
- Respondent20 (2025-05-02, 2): Average 2 → Yes
- Respondent11 (2025-04-04, 3): 3 ≠ 2.333 → No

So, the respondents who meet the condition are Respondent18, Respondent16, and Respondent20. That's a total of 3 respondents.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose 'Background (examination)' is higher than the average 'Background (examination)' for all sessions on the same date.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents whose 'Background (examination)' score is higher than the average 'Background (examination)' score for all sessions on the same date. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The 'Background_examination' predicate in the responses corresponds to the question ""Gives appropriate examination/observations. [Rubric: 0 = Observations are omitted or irrelevant, 1 = Observations reported but frequent clarification needed, 2 = Observations reported with few further questions needed, 3 = Comprehensive focused examination/observations]"". So each respondent has a score (0-3) for this category, and a date associated with their session.

The key steps here are:
1. For each respondent, determine their date and their Background_examination score.
2. For each date, calculate the average Background_examination score of all respondents on that date.
3. Compare each respondent's score to the average of their respective date.
4. Count how many respondents have a score higher than their date's average.

Let's start by extracting all the respondents with their dates and Background_examination scores. Looking at the responses:

- Respondent17: Date 2025-05-04, score 3
- Respondent11: 2025-04-04, 3
- Respondent14: 2025-03-14, 2
- Respondent21: 2025-05-16, 1
- Respondent5: 2025-05-04, 3
- Respondent10: 2025-03-14, 2
- Respondent13: 2025-03-14, 1
- Respondent6: 2025-04-04, 3
- Respondent23: 2025-03-14, 2
- Respondent9: 2025-05-04, 2
- Respondent8: 2025-05-02, 2

Now, group them by date:

2025-03-14: Respondents 14, 10, 13, 23. Scores: 2, 2, 1, 2. Average = (2+2+1+2)/4 = 7/4 = 1.75

2025-04-04: Respondents 11, 6. Scores: 3, 3. Average = 3

2025-05-02: Respondent8. Score 2. Average = 2

2025-05-04: Respondents17,5,9. Scores:3,3,2. Average = (3+3+2)/3 = 8/3 ≈2.666...

2025-05-16: Respondent21. Score1. Average=1

Now, compare each respondent's score to their date's average:

For 2025-03-14 (avg 1.75):
- Respondent14: 2 >1.75 → yes
- Respondent10: 2 >1.75 → yes
- Respondent13:1 <1.75 → no
- Respondent23:2 >1.75 → yes
Total here: 3

2025-04-04 (avg3):
- Respondent11:3 =3 → no
- Respondent6:3=3 → no
Total:0

2025-05-02 (avg2):
- Respondent8:2=2 → no

2025-05-04 (avg ~2.666):
- Respondent17:3>2.666 → yes
- Respondent5:3>2.666 → yes
- Respondent9:2 <2.666 → no
Total:2

2025-05-16 (avg1):
- Respondent21:1=1 → no

Adding up all the ""yes"" cases: 3 (from 03-14) + 2 (from 05-04) =5

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations. 

For 2025-03-14, the average is 1.75. Scores above that are 2,2,2 (respondents 14,10,23). So 3 people.

For 2025-05-04, average is 8/3 ≈2.666. Scores above are 3 and 3 (respondents17 and 5). So 2 people.

Total of 3+2=5. So the answer should be 5. But wait, let me check each respondent again.

Wait, in the data:

Respondent14: 2025-03-14, score2 → yes
Respondent10: same date, score2 → yes
Respondent23: same date, score2 → yes
Respondent13: same date, score1 → no

So 3 in that group.

In 2025-05-04:

Respondent17:3>2.666 → yes
Respondent5:3>2.666 → yes
Respondent9:2<2.666 → no

So 2 in that group.

Others: no.

Total 3+2=5. So the answer is 5.
