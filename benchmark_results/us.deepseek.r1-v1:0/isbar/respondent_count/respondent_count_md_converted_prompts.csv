</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the respondents who participated in a 'II-Anaphylaxsis' session.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task. The user wants me to count the respondents who participated in a 'II-Anaphylaxsis' session. 

First, I need to look through all the responses and check the 'SessionName' field for each respondent. The key here is to match exactly the session name 'II-Anaphylaxsis'. But I should also be careful about possible variations in the session names, like different spacing or punctuation.

Looking at the data:

- Respondent 3: SessionName is III-Sepsis. Not matching.
- Respondent 12: SessionName is II (Anaphylaxis). The name here is Anaphylaxis, but the task is looking for Anaphylaxsis. Wait, that's a possible typo. The user's task says 'II-Anaphylaxsis', so maybe there's a typo in some entries. Let me check all entries.

Respondent 23: SessionName is II-Anaphylaxsis. That's an exact match. So that's one.

Respondent 5: SessionName is II - Anaphylaxsis. The hyphen with spaces. The task is looking for 'II-Anaphylaxsis' without the space. But the session name in the data here is 'II - Anaphylaxsis' (with a space around the hyphen). Does that count? The task specifies 'II-Anaphylaxsis', but the actual data might have variations. However, the user's instruction is to count based on the exact match as per the data. Wait, the task says 'II-Anaphylaxsis' as the session name. Let me check the responses again.

Looking at the responses:

- Respondent 23: SessionName: II-Anaphylaxsis (exact match)
- Respondent 5: SessionName: II - Anaphylaxsis (with spaces around the hyphen)
- Any others?

Wait, the task is to count respondents in 'II-Anaphylaxsis' sessions. The hyphenation and spacing might differ. For example, in the data, some session names have hyphens with spaces, others without. For instance, Respondent 12 has 'II (Anaphylaxis)' which is a different spelling (Anaphylaxis vs. Anaphylaxsis). So, the key is to look for SessionName entries that are exactly 'II-Anaphylaxsis' or variations that are considered the same. But according to the data, Respondent 23's SessionName is 'II-Anaphylaxsis', and Respondent 5's is 'II - Anaphylaxsis' (with a space). Are these considered the same session? The task uses 'II-Anaphylaxsis' as the session name. The user might consider variations, but the output should be based on exact matches unless told otherwise. However, the task is to count those in 'II-Anaphylaxsis' sessions. Let's check the exact SessionName in each respondent.

Looking at the data:

- Respondent 23: SessionName: II-Anaphylaxsis (exact match)
- Respondent 5: SessionName: II - Anaphylaxsis (note the space around the hyphen and the spelling 'Anaphylaxsis')
- Respondent 12: SessionName: II (Anaphylaxis) (different spelling, ends with 'axis' instead of 'axsis')

So, the correct matches are Respondent 23 and Respondent 5? Wait, the SessionName for Respondent 5 is 'II - Anaphylaxsis' (with spaces and hyphen). The task is looking for 'II-Anaphylaxsis' (hyphen without spaces). Are these considered the same? The problem is that the session names might have different formatting but refer to the same session. For example, in the data, there's 'III-Sepsis' (Respondent 3) and 'III - Sepsis' (Respondent 15). So, the hyphen with or without spaces might be a formatting difference but the same session. However, the task is to count based on the exact SessionName as per the data. The user's task says 'II-Anaphylaxsis', so we need to check if any respondents have that exact SessionName.

Looking again:

- Respondent 23: SessionName is 'II-Anaphylaxsis' (exact match)
- Respondent 5: 'II - Anaphylaxsis' (hyphen with spaces, but same name otherwise)
- Are there others?

Wait, the task is to count respondents in 'II-Anaphylaxsis' sessions, so perhaps both Respondent 23 and 5 should be counted, assuming that the hyphen spacing doesn't matter. But according to the data, the SessionName is entered as per the respondent's input. For example, Respondent 5's SessionName is 'II - Anaphylaxsis' (with spaces), while Respondent 23's is 'II-Anaphylaxsis' (without spaces). Are these considered the same session? The user's task uses 'II-Anaphylaxsis' as the session name, so perhaps only Respondent 23 matches exactly. However, in the data, there's also Respondent 12 with 'II (Anaphylaxis)', which is a different spelling (Anaphylaxis vs. Anaphylaxsis). So, the key is to look for SessionName entries that exactly match 'II-Anaphylaxsis' (case-insensitive?), but the data entries have different variations.

Wait, the SessionName for Respondent 23 is 'II-Anaphylaxsis', which matches exactly. Respondent 5's is 'II - Anaphylaxsis' (with spaces and hyphen). The task is to count those in 'II-Anaphylaxsis' sessions. So, if the SessionName is exactly 'II-Anaphylaxsis', then only Respondent 23. But if variations like 'II - Anaphylaxsis' (with spaces) are considered the same, then Respondent 5 would also count. However, the task is to count based on the exact SessionName as per the data. The user's instruction says ""participated in a 'II-Anaphylaxsis' session"", so the exact string. Therefore, only Respondent 23. But wait, looking at the data again:

Wait, Respondent 5's SessionName is 'II - Anaphylaxsis' (with spaces around the hyphen). The task's target is 'II-Anaphylaxsis' (no spaces). So, unless the hyphen with spaces is considered the same, which might be a formatting difference, but in data terms, they are different strings. Therefore, only Respondent 23 has the exact SessionName 'II-Anaphylaxsis'. However, in the data provided, there's also Respondent 12 with 'II (Anaphylaxis)', which is a different session name. So, the correct count is 1 (Respondent 23) or 2 (including Respondent 5)?

Wait, the SessionName for Respondent 5 is 'II - Anaphylaxsis' (note the 'Anaphylaxsis' spelling, same as the task's target). The difference is the hyphen with spaces. So, the session name in the task is 'II-Anaphylaxsis', and Respondent 5's is 'II - Anaphylaxsis'. The session name in the data for Respondent 5 is written as 'II - Anaphylaxsis', which is a different string from 'II-Anaphylaxsis' due to the spaces around the hyphen. Therefore, they are different. So, only Respondent 23's SessionName exactly matches 'II-Anaphylaxsis'. Therefore, the count is 1.

But wait, let me check again. The task says 'II-Anaphylaxsis', and in the data, Respondent 23's SessionName is 'II-Anaphylaxsis', which is an exact match. Respondent 5's is 'II - Anaphylaxsis' (with spaces), which is a different string. So, only Respondent 23. Therefore, the answer is 1.

But wait, looking back at the data, Respondent 23's SessionName is 'II-Anaphylaxsis', and the task is to count that. So the answer is 1. But let me check all respondents again to make sure I didn't miss any.

Looking through all respondents:

- Respondent 1: V (Hypoglycemia)
- Respondent 3: III-Sepsis
- Respondent 13: I-VF
- Respondent 17: V (Hypoglycemia)
- Respondent 15: III - Sepsis
- Respondent 8: III (Sepsis)
- Respondent 7: III-Sepsis
- Respondent 12: II (Anaphylaxis)
- Respondent 23: II-Anaphylaxsis
- Respondent 19: I - MI
- Respondent 5: II - Anaphylaxsis
- Respondent 18: IV - VT

So, only Respondent 23 has SessionName exactly 'II-Anaphylaxsis'. Respondent 5's is 'II - Anaphylaxsis' (with spaces), which is a different string. Therefore, the count is 1.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who participated in a 'II - Anaphylaxsis' session.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task. The question is asking to count the respondents who participated in a session named 'II - Anaphylaxsis'. 

First, I need to look at the data provided in the responses section. Each respondent has a 'SessionName' field. My job is to check each respondent's SessionName and see if it matches 'II - Anaphylaxsis'. 

Wait, but I should also consider possible variations in the SessionName entries. For example, sometimes there might be hyphens, parentheses, or spaces that differ. Let me check the data carefully.

Looking at the responses:

- Respondent 23: SessionName is ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" (with a hyphen and no space)
- Respondent 5: SessionName is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" (with spaces around the hyphen)
- Respondent 12: SessionName is ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" (using parentheses and different spelling of Anaphylaxis vs Anaphylaxsis)
- Others have different SessionNames like ""I - MI"", ""III (Sepsis)"", etc.

Hmm, the task specifies 'II - Anaphylaxsis'. The spelling here is important. Let's note that some entries have ""Anaphylaxsis"" with double 's' and others might have ""Anaphylaxis"" with a single 's'. For example, Respondent 12 has ""Anaphylaxis"", which is a different spelling. So that's a different session name.

So, the exact match we need is for SessionName ""II - Anaphylaxsis"". Let's check each respondent:

- Respondent 23: ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" – the hyphen is without spaces. But the task's target has a hyphen with spaces. However, maybe the hyphen vs. dash or spacing isn't critical here. Wait, the task's example in the previous answer had a session name with a hyphen and the response had different formatting. But in the data, the exact SessionNames vary. For example, Respondent 5's SessionName is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" (with spaces around the hyphen), which matches exactly the task's target. Respondent 23's is ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" (no spaces). Are these considered the same? The task says 'II - Anaphylaxsis', so maybe the spacing matters. But perhaps in the data, the SessionName might have variations. Let me check the example given in the initial problem. In the example, the correct answer was 0 for a similar question, but in that case, the date was 2025-05-02, and looking at the data, there were respondents on that date but none with a score of 1 on Background (examination). 

But back to this task. The SessionName is 'II - Anaphylaxsis'. Let's look through all respondents:

- Respondent 5: SessionName is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" – this matches exactly.
- Respondent 23: ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" – hyphen without spaces. Is this considered the same? The task's target has a hyphen with spaces. Depending on how strict the matching is, this might be considered different. But maybe the hyphen vs. dash and spacing is a typo or formatting difference. For example, in the data, some SessionNames use hyphens, others parentheses. For instance, Respondent 12's SessionName is ""II (Anaphylaxis)"", which is a different format. 

But the task is specifically looking for 'II - Anaphylaxsis' (with spaces around the hyphen). So Respondent 5's entry matches exactly. Respondent 23's SessionName is ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" (no spaces), which might be a different entry. However, perhaps the user intended to include variations. Wait, in the data, the example given in the initial problem had a session named ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" (Respondent 23) and another ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" (Respondent 5). The task here is to count respondents in 'II - Anaphylaxsis' (with spaces). So only Respondent 5 matches exactly. 

But wait, let me check the spelling of Anaphylaxsis. Both Respondent 5 and 23 have ""Anaphylaxsis"" (with double 's'), while Respondent 12 has ""Anaphylaxis"" (single 's'). So the correct spelling might be a factor. The task uses ""Anaphylaxsis"" (double 's'), so Respondents 5 and 23 have that. But their SessionNames differ in hyphen spacing. 

If the SessionName is case-sensitive and exact, then only Respondent 5 matches. But perhaps the hyphen spacing is a typo, and both 5 and 23 should be counted. However, in data analysis, exact string matching is typically required unless specified otherwise. Since the task specifies 'II - Anaphylaxsis' (with spaces), only Respondent 5's entry matches exactly. 

Wait, looking back at the data:

Respondent 5's SessionName: ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" (with spaces around the hyphen)
Respondent 23's SessionName: ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" (no spaces)
Respondent 12's SessionName: ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" (different spelling and format)

So, only Respondent 5 has the exact SessionName as specified. Therefore, the count is 1.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who scored 3 on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task. The user wants me to count the respondents who scored 3 on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)'. 

First, I need to look at the 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' field in the questions section to confirm the rubric. The rubric says: 0 = No recommendation, 1 = Clear recommendation only after extended questioning, 2 = Clear recommendation after minimal questioning, 3 = Clear comprehensive recommendation without questioning. So, a score of 3 means the respondent provided a clear comprehensive recommendation without any questioning needed.

Now, I'll go through each respondent in the responses section and check their score for this specific field. Let's list them out one by one.

Respondent 8: Their 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' is 2. Not a 3, so skip.

Respondent 2: Score is 2 again. Not 3.

Respondent 17: Score is 3. That's one.

Respondent 23: Score is 3. That's another one.

Respondent 20: Score is 2. Not counted.

Respondent 22: Score is 2. Nope.

Respondent 4: Score is 2. Not 3.

Respondent 14: Score is 1. Doesn't qualify.

So, the respondents with a score of 3 are Respondent 17 and Respondent 23. That's two people. Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss any. 

Looking again: Respondent 17 and 23 both have 3. The others are all 2 or lower. So the total count is 2.

  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the respondents from the 'II (Anaphylactic Shock)' session who scored 1 on 'Background (history)' and 2 on 'Situation'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The goal is to count the respondents from the session named 'II (Anaphylactic Shock)' who scored 1 on 'Background (history)' and 2 on 'Situation'. 

First, I need to go through each respondent in the data and check if they meet all three conditions: SessionName is 'II (Anaphylactic Shock)', Background (history) score is 1, and Situation score is 2.

Looking at the responses:

- **Respondent 23**: SessionName is II-Anaphylaxsis. Not matching the exact session name. Background (history) is 2, which doesn't meet the 1 requirement. So, no.

- **Respondent 16**: SessionName is I - MI. Doesn't match. Skip.

- **Respondent 4**: SessionName is III (Sepsis). Not matching. Skip.

- **Respondent 5**: SessionName is II - Anaphylaxsis. Close but the name isn't exactly 'II (Anaphylactic Shock)'. So, no.

- **Respondent 1**: SessionName is V (Hypoglycemia). Doesn't match. Skip.

- **Respondent 18**: SessionName is IV - VT. Not matching. Skip.

- **Respondent 6**: SessionName is II (Anaphylactic Shock). That's a match. Now check the scores. Background (history) is 3, which is not 1. So, even though the session name matches, the score for Background (history) is 3, so this doesn't count.

- **Respondent 14**: SessionName is IV-Hypoglycemia. Doesn't match. Skip.

- **Respondent 11**: SessionName is IV (AF). Not matching. Skip.

- **Respondent 8**: SessionName is III (Sepsis). Doesn't match. Skip.

Wait, did I miss any? Let me check again. The session name must be exactly 'II (Anaphylactic Shock)'. Only Respondent 6 has that. But their Background (history) is 3 and Situation is 2. So Background (history) is 3, which doesn't meet the 1 requirement. 

So, none of the respondents meet all three criteria. Therefore, the count is 0.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who scored 0 on 'Background (history)' and whose 'Comments' contain the word 'Clear'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The goal is to count the respondents who scored 0 on 'Background (history)' and have the word 'Clear' in their 'Comments'. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The 'Background (history)' is a rubric-based question with scores from 0 to 3. The rubric for 0 is ""History is unstructured or non-relevant"". So I need to look for respondents where this field is exactly 0.

Next, the 'Comments' field is open-ended, and I need to check if it contains the word 'Clear' (case-sensitive, I assume, since the example in the data has 'Clear' with a capital C). So I'll scan each respondent's Comments for that exact word.

Now, let's go through each respondent in the data:

- **Respondent 21**: Background (history) is 3. Comments mention ""Diagnostic clarity"" and ""Good and early assessment"". The word 'Clear' isn't there. So no.
  
- **Respondent 7**: Background (history) is 2. Comments are about time. Not relevant.

- **Respondent 10**: Background (history) is 2. Comments mention time. No.

- **Respondent 11**: Background (history) is 3. Comments say ""Clear communication and handover"". Here, 'Clear' is present, but the score is 3. Doesn't meet both criteria.

- **Respondent 23**: Background (history) is 2. Comments have ""Talking to registrav could not summarize..."", and mentions 'Sepsis I Anaphylaxsis'. No 'Clear' here.

- **Respondent 2**: Background (history) is 2. Comments are empty. No.

- **Respondent 3**: Background (history) is 3. Comments include ""Clear communication between Reg and colleague"". Score is 3, so even though 'Clear' is present, the score isn't 0. Doesn't qualify.

- **Respondent 8**: Background (history) is 3. Comments: ""Clear communication during handover"". Again, score is 3. Not matching.

- **Respondent 9**: Background (history) is 2. Comments mention ""unclear communication"". The word 'Clear' isn't present as a standalone; 'unclear' doesn't count. So no.

- **Respondent 12**: Background (history) is 3. Comments: ""Good"". No 'Clear' here.

- **Respondent 14**: Background (history) is 2. Comments about time and late response. No 'Clear'.

- **Respondent 1**: Background (history) is 2. Comments: ""Satisfactory"". No 'Clear'.

Wait, looking through all respondents, none have a score of 0 in 'Background (history)'. The scores for that field are either 2, 3, or in one case (Respondent 3's Identification is 0, but their Background (history) is 3). So there are zero respondents who scored 0 on 'Background (history)' and have 'Clear' in their comments. 

Therefore, the count is 0.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 'Background (history)' is greater than 5.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The question is asking to count the respondents whose total score for 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 'Background (history)' is greater than 5. 

First, I need to make sure I understand the data structure. The 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 'Background (history)' are two different fields in the responses. Each has a rubric score from 0 to 3. The task is to sum these two scores for each respondent and count how many have a total greater than 5.

Let me go through each respondent one by one and calculate their scores.

Starting with Respondent 14:
- Background (history): 2
- Recommendation (global rating scale): 2
Total: 2 + 2 = 4. That's not greater than 5, so exclude.

Respondent 6:
- Background (history): 3
- Recommendation (global rating scale): 3
Total: 3 + 3 = 6. This is greater than 5. Count this one.

Respondent 2:
- Background (history): 2
- Recommendation (global rating scale): 1
Total: 2 + 1 = 3. Not enough.

Respondent 13:
- Background (history): 2
- Recommendation (global rating scale): 2
Total: 4. Exclude.

Respondent 16:
- Background (history): 3
- Recommendation (global rating scale): 3
Total: 6. Include.

Respondent 22:
- Background (history): 3
- Recommendation (global rating scale): 3
Total: 6. Include.

Respondent 10:
- Background (history): 2
- Recommendation (global rating scale): 2
Total: 4. Exclude.

So, the respondents who meet the criteria are 6, 16, and 22. That's three respondents. Let me double-check each to ensure I didn't make a mistake. 

Yes, each of those three has a sum of 6, which is greater than 5. The others are all 4 or lower. Therefore, the count should be 3.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Background (history)' and 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is greater than 3.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The question is asking to count the respondents whose total score for 'Background (history)' and 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is greater than 3. 

First, I need to make sure I understand the data structure. The 'Questions' section defines each field, and the 'Responses' section has the actual data from each respondent. 

Looking at the 'Background (history)' rubric, the scores can be 0, 1, 2, or 3. Similarly, 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' also uses a rubric with scores from 0 to 3. The task is to add these two scores for each respondent and count how many have a sum greater than 3.

Now, let's go through each respondent's data:

**Respondent 1:**
- Background (history): 2
- Recommendation (global rating scale): 2
- Sum: 2 + 2 = 4. 4 is greater than 3, so this counts.

**Respondent 10:**
- Background (history): 2
- Recommendation (global rating scale): 2
- Sum: 2 + 2 = 4. Also counts.

**Respondent 19:**
- Background (history): 3
- Recommendation (global rating scale): 3
- Sum: 3 + 3 = 6. Definitely counts.

**Respondent 20:**
- Background (history): 2
- Recommendation (global rating scale): 3
- Sum: 2 + 3 = 5. Counts.

**Respondent 4:**
- Background (history): 3
- Recommendation (global rating scale): 2
- Sum: 3 + 2 = 5. Counts.

Wait, but let me double-check each entry to make sure I didn't mix up any numbers. 

Looking again:

Respondent 1: 2 + 2 = 4 ✅  
Respondent 10: 2 + 2 = 4 ✅  
Respondent 19: 3 + 3 = 6 ✅  
Respondent 20: 2 + 3 = 5 ✅  
Respondent 4: 3 + 2 = 5 ✅  

All five respondents have a sum greater than 3. But wait, the example given in the problem had an answer of 0, but that was for a different question. In this case, all respondents except maybe someone? Let me check again.

Wait, the data provided in the questionnaire section includes Respondents 1, 10, 19, 20, and 4. Let me confirm each of their scores:

- **Respondent 1:** Background (history) is 2, GRS is 2. Sum 4.
- **Respondent 10:** Background (history) is 2, GRS is 2. Sum 4.
- **Respondent 19:** Background (history) is 3, GRS is 3. Sum 6.
- **Respondent 20:** Background (history) is 2, GRS is 3. Sum 5.
- **Respondent 4:** Background (history) is 3, GRS is 2. Sum 5.

So all five respondents have a sum greater than 3. But wait, the example answer was 0, but that was for a different question (counting those who scored 1 on Background (examination) on a specific date). Here, the task is different. 

Wait, but the data here has 5 respondents. All of them have a sum of 4, 4, 6, 5, 5. So all 5 would be counted. But let me check if there are any other respondents. The data in the questionnaire shows 5 respondents: 1, 10, 19, 20, 4. Are there more? The example had Respondent 1, 10, 19, 20, 4. So total 5. All of them have sums over 3. So the answer should be 5. But wait, let me check again.

Wait, no. Wait, Respondent 20's Background (history) is 2, and GRS is 3. 2+3=5. Correct. Respondent 4's Background (history) is 3, GRS is 2. 3+2=5. So all five respondents have sums greater than 3. Therefore, the count is 5. But wait, the example answer was 0, but that's a different question. So in this case, the answer should be 5. But let me check again to make sure I didn't miss any respondents.

Wait, the data provided in the questionnaire under responses includes:

- Respondent 1
- Respondent 10
- Respondent 19
- Respondent 20
- Respondent 4

That's five respondents. All of them have a sum of Background (history) and GRS greater than 3. Therefore, the answer is 5.

<task>
Count the respondents who scored 2 on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and whose 'Comments' contain the word 'communication'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The goal is to count the respondents who scored 2 on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and have the word 'communication' in their Comments. 

First, I need to look through each respondent's data. Let's start by identifying the 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' field. The rubric for this is 0-3, and we need those with a score of 2. Then, check their Comments for the presence of the word 'communication' (case-insensitive, I assume).

Looking at the respondents one by one:

- **Respondent 10**: Global rating scale is 2. Comments: ""Time: (15:53-16:14)"" – no 'communication' here. So, no.
- **Respondent 15**: Global rating 2. Comments mention ""clear communication"". That's a hit. So count this one.
- **Respondent 21**: Global rating 3. Doesn't meet the score requirement. Skip.
- **Respondent 18**: Global rating 2. Comments: ""Not very concise or clear communication"". Contains 'communication'. So yes.
- **Respondent 17**: Global rating 2. Comments: ""Concise - clear"" – no 'communication' word. So no.
- **Respondent 16**: Global rating 3. Skip.
- **Respondent 5**: Global rating 3. Skip.
- **Respondent 22**: Global rating 3. Skip.
- **Respondent 19**: Global rating 3. Skip.
- **Respondent 4**: Global rating 2. Comments: ""Clinical handover and communication skills..."" – has 'communication'. So yes.

So, Respondents 15, 18, and 4 meet both criteria. That's three respondents. Wait, let me double-check:

- Respondent 15: Score 2, Comments have 'communication' – yes.
- Respondent 18: Score 2, Comments mention 'communication' – yes.
- Respondent 4: Score 2, Comments include 'communication' – yes.

Wait, but Respondent 4's global rating is 2? Let me check again. Yes, Respondent 4's 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is 2. Comments: ""Clinical handover and communication skills, satisfactory"". So that's three. 

Wait, but in the data provided, let me confirm each entry again to avoid mistakes.

Respondent 15: Global rating 2, Comments: ""Detailed Response - clear communication"" – yes.

Respondent 18: Global rating 2, Comments: ""Not very concise or clear communication"" – yes.

Respondent 4: Global rating 2, Comments: ""Clinical handover and communication skills, satisfactory"" – yes.

So that's three respondents. But wait, let me check all others again to make sure I didn't miss any.

Respondent 17: Global rating 2, Comments: ""Concise - clear"" – no 'communication'.

Others with global rating 2 are 10, 15, 18, 17, 4. Wait, Respondent 10's global rating is 2, but their comments don't have 'communication'. So total of three: 15, 18, 4. So the answer should be 3.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Identification' and 'Assessment' is greater than 6.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents whose total score for 'Identification' and 'Assessment' is greater than 6. 

First, I need to make sure I understand the data structure. The 'Questions' section defines each field. 'Identification' and 'Assessment' are both rubric-based scores. The rubric for 'Identification' ranges from 0 to 3, and 'Assessment' also ranges from 0 to 3. So the maximum possible combined score for these two would be 3 + 3 = 6. Wait, the question asks for a total greater than 6. But if each can only go up to 3, their sum can't exceed 6. That seems impossible. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the data again.

Looking at the responses, let's check each respondent's 'Identification' and 'Assessment' scores. For example, Respondent 11 has Identification 3 and Assessment 3, which sums to 6. That's the maximum. So if the question is asking for a total greater than 6, there should be no respondents. But wait, let me check all the data to be sure.

Looking at each respondent:

- Respondent 11: ID 3, Assessment 3 → 6
- Respondent 6: ID 3, Assessment 2 → 5
- Respondent 15: ID 3, Assessment 2 → 5
- Respondent 9: ID 3, Assessment 2 → 5
- Respondent 22: ID 3, Assessment 2 → 5
- Respondent 1: ID -1, Assessment 3 → 2 (since -1 +3=2)
- Respondent 23: ID 3, Assessment 3 → 6
- Respondent 10: ID 2, Assessment 2 →4

So the highest total is 6 (Respondents 11 and 23). Since the task is to count those with a total greater than 6, which is impossible given the maximum possible sum is 6, the answer should be 0. But wait, maybe there's a mistake in the data. Let me check Respondent 1's Identification score. It's -1, which is odd because the rubric for Identification is 0-3. That might be a data entry error, but according to the data provided, it's -1. So their total is 2. 

Therefore, no respondents have a total score exceeding 6. The answer is 0.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents from the 'V (Hypoglycemia)' session who scored 0 on 'Identification' and 1 on 'Assessment'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The question is asking to count the respondents from the 'V (Hypoglycemia)' session who scored 0 on 'Identification' and 1 on 'Assessment'. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The dataset has a list of respondents with various fields. The key fields here are 'SessionName', 'Identification', and 'Assessment'. 

Starting with the 'SessionName', I need to filter all respondents where the SessionName is exactly 'V (Hypoglycemia)'. Let me look through each respondent's SessionName.

Looking at the responses:

- Respondent 17 has SessionName: V (Hypoglycemia)
- Others have different SessionNames like IV (VT), III-Sepsis, etc. So only Respondent 17 is in the 'V (Hypoglycemia)' session.

Next, check the 'Identification' score for Respondent 17. The value is 3. The task requires a score of 0. Since 3 doesn't match, Respondent 17 doesn't qualify. 

Now, even though there's only one respondent in that session, I need to confirm if there are others. Let me double-check all respondents again. No, only Respondent 17 has that SessionName. 

Since the Identification score is 3 (which is ""Introduces themselves and information is complete"" according to the rubric), and the required score is 0 (""Requires direct prompting""), this respondent doesn't meet the criteria. 

Additionally, the 'Assessment' score for Respondent 17 is 3. The task requires a score of 1 (""Assessment only after extended questioning""). So even if the Identification was 0, the Assessment score here is 3, which doesn't match. 

Therefore, there are no respondents in the 'V (Hypoglycemia)' session with Identification 0 and Assessment 1. The count should be 0.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents from the 'IV (AF)' session who scored 0 on 'Background (examination)' and 2 on 'Identification'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents from the 'IV (AF)' session who scored 0 on 'Background (examination)' and 2 on 'Identification'. 

First, I need to go through each respondent in the data and check if they meet all three conditions: their SessionName is 'IV (AF)', their Background (examination) score is 0, and their Identification score is 2.

Looking at the responses:

- **Respondent 5**: SessionName is 'II - Anaphylaxsis'. Doesn't match 'IV (AF)'. Skip.
- **Respondent 16**: SessionName is 'I - MI'. Not matching. Skip.
- **Respondent 11**: SessionName is 'IV (AF)'. That's a match. Now check their scores. Background (examination) is 3, which isn't 0. Identification is 3. So doesn't meet the criteria.
- **Respondent 8**: SessionName is 'III (Sepsis)'. Not relevant.
- **Respondent 1**: SessionName is 'V (Hypoglycemia)'. No match.
- **Respondent 9**: SessionName is 'II (Anaphylaxsis)'. Not IV (AF).
- **Respondent 13**: SessionName is 'I-VF'. Doesn't match.
- **Respondent 20**: SessionName is 'IV (VT)'. Close, but VT instead of AF. So no.
- **Respondent 22**: SessionName is 'IV (VT)'. Again, VT, not AF. 

Now, checking all, none of the respondents in the 'IV (AF)' session have both a 0 in Background (examination) and 2 in Identification. The only respondent in IV (AF) is Respondent 11, but their scores are 3 and 3. So the count should be 0.

  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the respondents from the 'II-Anaphylaxsis' session who scored 0 on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 2 on 'Situation'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The question is asking to count the respondents from the 'II-Anaphylaxsis' session who scored 0 on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 2 on 'Situation'. 

First, I need to identify all respondents in the 'II-Anaphylaxsis' session. Let's look through each respondent's SessionName. 

Looking at the responses:

- Respondent 9 has SessionName ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"". The spelling here is ""Anaphylaxsis"" with an extra 's'. 
- Respondent 23 has SessionName ""II-Anaphylaxsis"". The hyphen is used here instead of parentheses, but the session name is ""II-Anaphylaxsis"". 

Wait, the task specifies 'II-Anaphylaxsis' exactly. So Respondent 23's SessionName is a match. Respondent 9's SessionName is ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"", which is similar but uses parentheses. However, the task is looking for the exact 'II-Anaphylaxsis' as per the session name. So maybe only Respondent 23 qualifies here. 

But I should check if there are other respondents with that exact session name. Let me check all the responses again:

- Respondent 10: (MI)-VT
- Respondent 12: II (Anaphylaxis) – note the correct spelling ""Anaphylaxis"" without the extra 's'.
- Respondent 23: II-Anaphylaxsis (with the extra 's').

So only Respondent 23 has SessionName exactly ""II-Anaphylaxsis"". 

Now, for Respondent 23, check their scores on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 'Situation'. 

Looking at Respondent 23's data:
- Recommendation (global rating scale): 3
- Situation: 3

The task requires a score of 0 on Recommendation (GRS) and 2 on Situation. But Respondent 23 has 3 and 3. So they don't meet the criteria. 

Wait, maybe I missed other respondents. Let me check again. Are there any other respondents with SessionName 'II-Anaphylaxsis'? The only one is Respondent 23. 

Wait, the task says 'II-Anaphylaxsis' session. The hyphen is part of the session name. So Respondent 9's session is ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"" which is different. So no other respondents. 

Therefore, even though Respondent 9's session is similar, the exact match is only Respondent 23. But their scores don't meet the required 0 and 2. 

So the count would be zero. 

But wait, let me check again. Maybe there's a typo in the session names. For example, Respondent 9's SessionName is ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"" with the extra 's', and Respondent 12's is ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" without the extra 's'. The task's session name is ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" (with the extra 's'). So only Respondent 23's session matches exactly. 

But Respondent 23's scores are 3 and 3. So no one meets both criteria. Therefore, the answer is 0.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the respondents from the 'IV (VT)' session who scored 1 on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 0 on 'Background (examination)'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents from the 'IV (VT)' session who scored 1 on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 0 on 'Background (examination)'. 

First, I need to go through each respondent in the data and check if they meet all three conditions: their SessionName is 'IV (VT)', their 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is 1, and their 'Background (examination)' is 0.

Looking at the Responses section:

Starting with Respondent 15: SessionName is 'III - Sepsis', so that's not a match. Next, Respondent 10's SessionName is '(MI)-VT', which isn't 'IV (VT)'. Respondent 6's session is 'II (Anaphylactic Shock)', so no. Respondent 13's session is 'I-VF', not matching. Respondent 17's session is 'V (Hypoglycemia)'. Respondent 22's session is 'IV (VT)'—so that's a possible candidate. Let's check their scores: 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is 3, and 'Background (examination)' is 3. Doesn't meet the criteria. 

Respondent 4's session is 'III (Sepsis)', so no. Respondent 18's SessionName is 'IV - VT'. Wait, the task specifies 'IV (VT)'. The hyphen vs. parentheses might be a formatting difference. But in the data, the exact SessionName for Respondent 22 is 'IV (VT)', while Respondent 18's is 'IV - VT'. Are these considered the same? The problem states 'IV (VT)', so I should stick to exact matches. So Respondent 18's session name is 'IV - VT', which is different from 'IV (VT)', so they don't match. 

Now, any other respondents? Let me check again. The list includes Respondents 15,10,6,13,17,22,4,18. That's all. 

Looking at each of these, only Respondent 22 has SessionName 'IV (VT)'. Their 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is 3, which is not 1, and 'Background (examination)' is 3. So they don't meet the criteria. 

Are there any other respondents in the data with SessionName 'IV (VT)'? From the given data, no. So even if we consider possible typos or variations, there's no one else. 

Therefore, the count is zero. No respondents meet all three conditions.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Assessment' and 'Identification' is greater than 6.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents whose total score for 'Assessment' and 'Identification' is greater than 6. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The questions section defines each field, including the rubric for scoring. The 'Assessment' and 'Identification' are both rubric-based scores. 

Looking at the rubric:
- **Identification** is scored from 0 to 3.
- **Assessment** is also scored from 0 to 3.

The total of these two scores needs to be greater than 6. Since each can be up to 3, the maximum possible total is 6 (3+3). Wait, that's confusing. If the maximum total is 6, how can the total be greater than 6? That seems impossible. But maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the data again.

Wait, looking at the responses, for example, Respondent 20 has Identification 3 and Assessment 3. That's a total of 6. But the question asks for a total greater than 6. So, according to the rubrics, it's impossible. But maybe there's a mistake in the data entry. Let me check all respondents.

Let me go through each respondent's 'Identification' and 'Assessment' scores:

- **Respondent 20**: Identification 3, Assessment 3 → Total 6
- **Respondent 8**: Identification 3, Assessment 2 → Total 5
- **Respondent 22**: Identification 3, Assessment 2 → Total 5
- **Respondent 5**: Identification 3, Assessment 3 → Total 6
- **Respondent 16**: Identification 3, Assessment 3 → Total 6
- **Respondent 23**: Identification 3, Assessment 3 → Total 6
- **Respondent 15**: Identification 3, Assessment 2 → Total 5
- **Respondent 12**: Identification 3, Assessment 2 → Total 5
- **Respondent 7**: Identification 3, Assessment 2 → Total 5
- **Respondent 19**: Identification 3, Assessment 2 → Total 5

Wait, all respondents have Identification scores of 3. The Assessment scores vary between 2 and 3. So the total for each is either 5 (3+2) or 6 (3+3). The question asks for totals greater than 6. Since the maximum possible is 6, there are no respondents who meet this condition. Therefore, the answer should be 0.

But let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss any respondents. Let's go through each one again:

- Respondent 20: 3+3=6 → Not >6
- Respondent 8: 3+2=5 → No
- Respondent 22: 3+2=5 → No
- Respondent 5: 3+3=6 → No
- Respondent 16: 3+3=6 → No
- Respondent 23: 3+3=6 → No
- Respondent 15: 3+2=5 → No
- Respondent 12: 3+2=5 → No
- Respondent 7: 3+2=5 → No
- Respondent 19: 3+2=5 → No

All totals are 5 or 6. None exceed 6. Therefore, the count is 0.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Identification' and 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is greater than 5.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents whose total score for 'Identification' and 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is greater than 5. 

First, I need to understand what each of these fields represents. Looking at the questions section:

- **Identification:** The rubric is 0 to 3. So possible scores are 0, 1, 2, or 3.
- **Recommendation (global rating scale):** Also a rubric from 0 to 3. Same possible scores.

The total score for each respondent is the sum of these two fields. We need to find respondents where this sum is greater than 5. Since each can be up to 3, the maximum possible sum is 6 (3+3). So, the only way the sum is greater than 5 is if the sum is exactly 6. Because 3 + 3 = 6, which is the only combination that gives a total over 5.

Now, I need to go through each respondent and check their scores for these two fields. Let's list them out one by one.

**Respondent 16:**
- Identification: 3
- Recommendation (global rating scale): 3
- Sum: 3 + 3 = 6 → Yes.

**Respondent 18:**
- Identification: 3
- GRS: 2
- Sum: 5 → No.

**Respondent 7:**
- Identification: 3
- GRS: 2
- Sum: 5 → No.

**Respondent 8:**
- Identification: 3
- GRS: 3
- Sum: 6 → Yes.

**Respondent 3:**
- Identification: 0
- GRS: 3
- Sum: 3 → No.

**Respondent 17:**
- Identification: 3
- GRS: 2
- Sum: 5 → No.

**Respondent 15:**
- Identification: 3
- GRS: 2
- Sum: 5 → No.

**Respondent 12:**
- Identification: 3
- GRS: 3
- Sum: 6 → Yes.

**Respondent 2:**
- Identification: 3
- GRS: 1
- Sum: 4 → No.

**Respondent 10:**
- Identification: 2
- GRS: 2
- Sum: 4 → No.

**Respondent 22:**
- Identification: 3
- GRS: 3
- Sum: 6 → Yes.

**Respondent 1:**
- Identification: -1 (Wait, the rubric for Identification is 0-3. But here it's -1. Maybe a typo? But according to the data, it's -1. So sum would be -1 + 2 = 1 → No.)

So, the respondents with sum >5 (i.e., sum=6) are: 16, 8, 12, 22. That's four respondents. Let me double-check each:

- 16: 3+3=6 ✅
- 8: 3+3=6 ✅
- 12:3+3=6 ✅
- 22:3+3=6 ✅

Yes, four respondents. So the answer is 4.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who scored 3 on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and whose 'Comments' contain the word 'Overall'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The goal is to count the respondents who scored 3 on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and have the word 'Overall' in their Comments. 

First, I need to look at each respondent's data. Let's start by going through each one.

Looking at Respondent 17: Their 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' is 3. Now, check the Comments. The comments are ""Concise - clear"" and ""Satisfactory"". No 'Overall' here, so this one doesn't count.

Respondent 7: Their score here is 2. So even if the comments had 'Overall', it wouldn't matter. But their comments are about time. Skip.

Respondent 19: Score is 3. Comments mention ""Wrong CPR position"" and ""Clarity is a bit low..."". No 'Overall'. Not counted.

Respondent 18: Score is 2. Comments say ""Not very concise..."". Doesn't meet the score requirement.

Respondent 5: Score is 2. Comments are ""Good clear..."". No 'Overall'.

Respondent 6: Score is 2. Comments are empty. Skip.

Respondent 11: Score is 3. Comments: ""Clear communication and handover"". No 'Overall' here either.

Respondent 15: Score is 2. Comments mention ""Detailed Response..."". Not applicable.

Respondent 2: Score is 2. Comments are empty. 

Respondent 23: Score is 3. Comments include ""Time..."" and ""Talking to registrav..."". No 'Overall' in there.

Respondent 4: Score is 2. Comments talk about ""Clinical handover..."". Not relevant.

Respondent 12: Score is 3. Comments are ""Good"". No 'Overall' here either.

Wait, did I miss any? Let me check again. All respondents with score 3 in 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' are 17, 11, 23, and 12. Now, checking their comments:

- 17: No 'Overall'.
- 11: No 'Overall'.
- 23: No 'Overall'.
- 12: No 'Overall'.

None of them have 'Overall' in their comments. So the count should be 0.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents from the 'I - MI' session who scored 0 on 'Identification' and 2 on 'Situation'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The goal is to count the respondents from the 'I - MI' session who scored 0 on 'Identification' and 2 on 'Situation'. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The questions section defines each field, and the responses are from various respondents. 

The task specifies two criteria: 
1. SessionName must be 'I - MI'.
2. The 'Identification' score is 0.
3. The 'Situation' score is 2.

Wait, the task says ""scored 0 on 'Identification' and 2 on 'Situation'"". So both conditions must be met for a respondent to be counted.

Now, I'll go through each respondent in the responses and check these three conditions.

Looking at the responses:

- **Respondent 16**: 
  - SessionName: I - MI
  - Identification: 3
  - Situation: 3
  → Doesn't meet the scores, so no.

- **Respondent 3**: 
  - SessionName: III-Sepsis
  → Wrong session, skip.

- **Respondent 17**: 
  - SessionName: V (Hypoglycemia)
  → Not relevant.

- **Respondent 15**: 
  - SessionName: III - Sepsis
  → No.

- **Respondent 2**: 
  - SessionName: MI
  → The session name is 'MI', but the task is looking for 'I - MI'. Are these considered the same? The example in the data shows 'I - MI' and 'MI' as different sessions (Respondent 16 vs. Respondent 2). So 'MI' is a different session name. So this respondent is not part of 'I - MI'.

- **Respondent 20**: 
  - SessionName: IV (VT)
  → No.

- **Respondent 5**: 
  - SessionName: II - Anaphylaxsis
  → No.

- **Respondent 14**: 
  - SessionName: IV-Hypoglycemia
  → No.

- **Respondent 8**: 
  - SessionName: III (Sepsis)
  → No.

- **Respondent 10**: 
  - SessionName: (MI)-VT
  → No.

- **Respondent 1**: 
  - SessionName: V (Hypoglycemia)
  → No.

- **Respondent 9**: 
  - SessionName: II (Anaphylaxsis)
  → No.

Now, among all respondents, only Respondent 16 is in the 'I - MI' session. But their Identification is 3 and Situation is 3. So they don't meet the criteria. Are there any other respondents in 'I - MI'? Let me check again.

Wait, the task is to count respondents from the 'I - MI' session. The only respondent with SessionName 'I - MI' is Respondent 16. But their Identification is 3 and Situation is 3. So they don't meet the 0 and 2 scores. 

Therefore, there are zero respondents who meet all three criteria. The answer should be 0.

</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The goal is to count the respondents whose total score for 'Situation' and 'Background (history)' is greater than 3. 

First, I need to make sure I understand the data structure. The 'Questions' section defines each field. 'Situation' and 'Background (history)' are both rubric-based scores ranging from 0 to 3. The task is to sum these two scores for each respondent and count how many have a sum greater than 3.

Now, I'll go through each respondent in the 'Responses' section and calculate their total for these two fields. Let's list them out:

**Respondent 22:**
- Situation: 3
- Background (history): 3
- Total: 3 + 3 = 6 → 6 > 3 → Count

**Respondent 10:**
- Situation: 2
- Background (history): 2
- Total: 2 + 2 = 4 → 4 > 3 → Count

**Respondent 1:**
- Situation: 2
- Background (history): 2
- Total: 4 → Count

**Respondent 13:**
- Situation: 3
- Background (history): 2
- Total: 5 → Count

**Respondent 9:**
- Situation: 3
- Background (history): 2
- Total: 5 → Count

**Respondent 21:**
- Situation: 2
- Background (history): 3
- Total: 5 → Count

**Respondent 7:**
- Situation: 3
- Background (history): 2
- Total: 5 → Count

**Respondent 3:**
- Situation: 2
- Background (history): 3
- Total: 5 → Count

**Respondent 18:**
- Situation: 3
- Background (history): 2
- Total: 5 → Count

**Respondent 17:**
- Situation: 3
- Background (history): 3
- Total: 6 → Count

**Respondent 6:**
- Situation: 2
- Background (history): 3
- Total: 5 → Count

Now, let's count how many respondents meet the criteria. Checking each:

- Respondent 22: Yes
- Respondent 10: Yes
- Respondent 1: Yes
- Respondent 13: Yes
- Respondent 9: Yes
- Respondent 21: Yes
- Respondent 7: Yes
- Respondent 3: Yes
- Respondent 18: Yes
- Respondent 17: Yes
- Respondent 6: Yes

That's 11 respondents in total. Wait, but let me double-check each entry to ensure I didn't make a mistake. All the totals calculated are indeed greater than 3. However, looking back at Respondent 1, their 'Background (history)' is 2 and 'Situation' is 2, which sums to 4. Correct. All others have sums of 5 or 6. So 11 respondents in total. But wait, the example answer was 0 for a different question, but here we have 11. Let me confirm again.

Wait, the data provided in the questionnaire section includes 11 respondents. Let me recount each one:

1. Respondent 22: 3+3=6 ✅
2. Respondent 10: 2+2=4 ✅
3. Respondent 1: 2+2=4 ✅
4. Respondent 13:3+2=5 ✅
5. Respondent 9:3+2=5 ✅
6. Respondent 21:2+3=5 ✅
7. Respondent 7:3+2=5 ✅
8. Respondent 3:2+3=5 ✅
9. Respondent 18:3+2=5 ✅
10. Respondent 17:3+3=6 ✅
11. Respondent 6:2+3=5 ✅

Yes, all 11 respondents have a total greater than 3. But wait, that seems high. Let me check if any of them have a sum less than or equal to 3. For example, Respondent 10: 2+2=4, which is okay. Respondent 1: 2+2=4. All others are 5 or 6. So all 11 respondents meet the condition. But the example answer for a different question was 0, but that's a different task. So the answer here should be 11.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose 'Identification' is higher than the average 'Identification' for all sessions on the same date.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents whose 'Identification' score is higher than the average 'Identification' score for all sessions on the same date. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The data provided includes multiple respondents, each with a 'Date' and an 'Identification' score. The 'Identification' rubric is from 0 to 3. 

The plan is to:
1. Group the respondents by their 'Date'.
2. For each date, calculate the average 'Identification' score.
3. For each respondent, compare their 'Identification' score to the average of their respective date group.
4. Count how many respondents have a score higher than their group's average.

Let's start by listing all the respondents and their dates and Identification scores:

- Respondent 18: 2025-05-04, 3
- Respondent 2: 2025-04-04, 3
- Respondent 3: 2025-04-04, 0
- Respondent 16: 2025-05-02, 3
- Respondent 22: 2025-05-16, 3
- Respondent 10: 2025-03-14, 2
- Respondent 14: 2025-03-14, 3
- Respondent 6: 2025-04-04, 3

Now, group them by date:

2025-03-14:
- Respondent 10: 2
- Respondent 14: 3
Average = (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5

2025-04-04:
- Respondent 2: 3
- Respondent 3: 0
- Respondent 6: 3
Average = (3 + 0 + 3)/3 = 2

2025-05-02:
- Respondent 16: 3
Average = 3 (since only one respondent, average is same as the value)

2025-05-04:
- Respondent 18: 3
Average = 3

2025-05-16:
- Respondent 22: 3
Average = 3

Now, compare each respondent's score to their date's average:

2025-03-14:
- Respondent 10: 2 vs 2.5 → 2 < 2.5 → No
- Respondent 14: 3 vs 2.5 → 3 > 2.5 → Yes

2025-04-04:
- Respondent 2: 3 vs 2 → 3 > 2 → Yes
- Respondent 3: 0 vs 2 → No
- Respondent 6: 3 vs 2 → Yes

2025-05-02:
- Respondent 16: 3 vs 3 → Equal → No

2025-05-04:
- Respondent 18: 3 vs 3 → Equal → No

2025-05-16:
- Respondent 22: 3 vs 3 → Equal → No

So, the respondents who meet the criteria are Respondent 14, 2, and 6. That's a total of 3 respondents.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score across all rubric items is below the average total score for all sessions.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the number of respondents whose total score across all rubric items is below the average total score for all sessions. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The dataset includes several respondents, each with scores in various rubric categories. The rubric items are Identification, Situation, Background (history), Background (examination), Assessment, Recommendation (clear recommendation), and Recommendation (global rating scale). Each of these has a score from 0 to 3. 

So, for each respondent, I need to calculate the total score by adding up all these individual scores. Then, compute the average total score across all respondents. Finally, count how many respondents have a total score below that average.

Let me start by listing all the respondents and their scores. Let's go through each one:

**Respondent 21:**
- Identification: 3
- Situation: 2
- Background (history): 3
- Background (examination): 1
- Assessment: 2
- Recommendation (clear recommendation): 3
- Recommendation (global rating scale): 3
Total = 3+2+3+1+2+3+3 = 17

**Respondent 23:**
- All scores except Background (history) and examination are 3, but Background (history) is 2, examination is 2.
Total = 3+3+2+2+3+3+3 = 19

**Respondent 14:**
- Background (history): 2, examination: 2. Recommendation (clear recommendation):1, GRS:2.
Total = 3+3+2+2+3+1+2 = 16

**Respondent 12:**
- All scores are 3 except Assessment:2.
Total = 3+3+3+3+2+3+3 = 20

**Respondent 13:**
- Background (history):2, examination:1. Assessment:2, clear recommendation:2, GRS:2.
Total = 3+3+2+1+2+2+2 = 15

**Respondent 15:**
- Background (history):2, examination:3. Assessment:2, clear recommendation:2, GRS:2.
Total = 3+3+2+3+2+2+2 = 17

**Respondent 19:**
- All 3s except Assessment:2.
Total = 3+3+3+3+2+3+3 = 20

**Respondent 17:**
- All 3s except GRS:2.
Total = 3+3+3+3+3+3+2 = 20

**Respondent 2:**
- Background (history):2, examination:3. Clear recommendation:2, GRS:1.
Total = 3+3+2+3+3+2+1 = 17

Now, let's list all the totals:
- 21:17
- 23:19
- 14:16
- 12:20
- 13:15
- 15:17
- 19:20
- 17:20
- 2:17

Next, calculate the average total score. Sum all totals and divide by the number of respondents (9).

Sum = 17+19+16+20+15+17+20+20+17 = 161
Average = 161 / 9 ≈ 17.89

Now, find how many respondents have a total below 17.89. Looking at the totals:
- 17: Respondents 21, 14, 13, 15, 2 (each has 17,16,15,17,17)
Wait, let me check each:

- Respondent 21:17 (17 < 17.89 → yes)
- 23:19 (no)
- 14:16 (yes)
- 12:20 (no)
- 13:15 (yes)
- 15:17 (yes)
- 19:20 (no)
- 17:20 (no)
- 2:17 (yes)

So that's 21 (17), 14 (16), 13 (15), 15 (17), 2 (17). That's 5 respondents. Wait, 17 is below 17.89? Yes, because 17.89 is approximately 17.89, so 17 is below. So each of the 17s count. 

Wait, let me recount:

Total scores below 17.89 are those with 15,16,17. 

Looking at each:

- 21:17 → below
- 14:16 → below
- 13:15 → below
- 15:17 → below
- 2:17 → below

That's 5 respondents. 

Wait, but Respondent 21, 15, and 2 all have 17. 17 is less than 17.89, so they count. So total of 5. 

But wait, the sum of the totals was 161, divided by 9 is 17.888..., so 17.89 when rounded. So 17 is below that. 

Therefore, the answer is 5.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose 'Background (examination)' score is equal to the average 'Background (examination)' score for all sessions that occurred on the same date.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents whose 'Background (examination)' score is equal to the average 'Background (examination)' score for all sessions that occurred on the same date. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The dataset includes multiple respondents, each with a 'Date' and a 'Background (examination)' score. The goal is to group respondents by their session dates, calculate the average score for each date, and then count how many respondents on each date have a score equal to that average.

Let me start by listing all the respondents and their dates along with their 'Background (examination)' scores. 

Looking at the responses:

- Respondent 5: 2025-05-04, score 3
- Respondent 21: 2025-05-16, score 1
- Respondent 12: 2025-05-02, score 3
- Respondent 4: 2025-05-16, score 2
- Respondent 6: 2025-04-04, score 3
- Respondent 18: 2025-05-04, score 2
- Respondent 13: 2025-03-14, score 1
- Respondent 23: 2025-03-14, score 2
- Respondent 22: 2025-05-16, score 3
- Respondent 20: 2025-05-02, score -1
- Respondent 1: 2025-05-02, score 2
- Respondent 17: 2025-05-04, score 3

Now, group them by date:

2025-03-14: Respondents 13 (1), 23 (2) → Average = (1 + 2)/2 = 1.5
2025-04-04: Respondent 6 (3) → Average = 3
2025-05-02: Respondents 12 (3), 20 (-1), 1 (2) → Average = (3 + (-1) + 2)/3 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333...
2025-05-04: Respondents 5 (3), 18 (2), 17 (3) → Average = (3 + 2 + 3)/3 = 8/3 ≈ 2.666...
2025-05-16: Respondents 21 (1), 4 (2), 22 (3) → Average = (1 + 2 + 3)/3 = 6/3 = 2

Next, check which respondents have a score equal to the average for their date:

- 2025-03-14: Average 1.5. No respondents have exactly 1.5. So 0.
- 2025-04-04: Average 3. Respondent 6 has 3. So 1.
- 2025-05-02: Average ~1.333. None of the scores (3, -1, 2) equal this. So 0.
- 2025-05-04: Average ~2.666. Scores are 3, 2, 3. None equal 2.666. So 0.
- 2025-05-16: Average 2. Respondent 4 has 2. So 1.

Adding them up: 1 (from 2025-04-04) + 1 (from 2025-05-16) = 2.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations. For 2025-05-16, the average is exactly 2. Respondent 4 has a score of 2, so that's correct. For 2025-04-04, only one respondent with score 3, which matches the average. So total of 2 respondents. 

But wait, the answer in the example was 0 for a similar question. But this task is different. The example was about a specific date (2025-05-02) and score 1. Here, it's about each date's average. So the answer here should be 2.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who participated in a session where the average 'Assessment' for that session name is greater than 1.5.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents who participated in a session where the average 'Assessment' score for that session name is greater than 1.5. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The data has multiple respondents, each with a SessionName and an Assessment score. The goal is to group respondents by their SessionName, calculate the average Assessment for each session, and then count how many respondents are in sessions where this average is above 1.5.

Let me start by listing all the respondents and their SessionNames and Assessment scores. Let's go through each respondent:

- Respondent 15: SessionName ""III - Sepsis"", Assessment 2
- Respondent 22: SessionName ""IV (VT)"", Assessment 2
- Respondent 18: SessionName ""IV - VT"", Assessment 3
- Respondent 14: SessionName ""IV-Hypoglycemia"", Assessment 3
- Respondent 21: SessionName ""I (Myocardial infarction)"", Assessment 2
- Respondent 13: SessionName ""I-VF"", Assessment 2
- Respondent 8: SessionName ""III (Sepsis)"", Assessment 2
- Respondent 17: SessionName ""V (Hypoglycemia)"", Assessment 3
- Respondent 16: SessionName ""I - MI"", Assessment 3
- Respondent 6: SessionName ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"", Assessment 2

Now, I need to group these by SessionName. But wait, some SessionNames might be the same but written differently. For example, ""III - Sepsis"" and ""III (Sepsis)"" could be considered the same session. Similarly, ""IV (VT)"" and ""IV - VT"" might be the same. Let me check:

Looking at the SessionNames:

- III - Sepsis (Respondent 15)
- IV (VT) (Respondent 22)
- IV - VT (Respondent 18)
- IV-Hypoglycemia (Respondent 14)
- I (Myocardial infarction) (Respondent 21)
- I-VF (Respondent 13)
- III (Sepsis) (Respondent 8)
- V (Hypoglycemia) (Respondent 17)
- I - MI (Respondent 16)
- II (Anaphylactic Shock) (Respondent 6)

Hmm, the variations in naming could be important. For instance, ""III - Sepsis"" and ""III (Sepsis)"" might be the same session but formatted differently. Similarly, ""IV (VT)"" and ""IV - VT"" could be the same. Let's assume that the session name is determined by the main part, ignoring punctuation and spacing differences. So:

- ""III - Sepsis"" and ""III (Sepsis)"" both refer to Session III Sepsis.
- ""IV (VT)"" and ""IV - VT"" both refer to Session IV VT.
- ""IV-Hypoglycemia"" and ""V (Hypoglycemia)"" are different sessions (IV vs V).
- ""I (Myocardial infarction)"" and ""I - MI"" might be the same, as MI stands for Myocardial Infarction. So ""I - MI"" is likely Session I Myocardial Infarction.
- ""I-VF"" is probably Session I VF (Ventricular Fibrillation).
- ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"" is Session II Anaphylactic Shock.

So grouping them accordingly:

1. Session III Sepsis:
   - Respondent 15 (Assessment 2)
   - Respondent 8 (Assessment 2)
   Average: (2 + 2)/2 = 2.0

2. Session IV VT:
   - Respondent 22 (Assessment 2)
   - Respondent 18 (Assessment 3)
   Average: (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5

3. Session IV-Hypoglycemia:
   - Respondent 14 (Assessment 3)
   Average: 3.0

4. Session I Myocardial Infarction (MI):
   - Respondent 21 (Assessment 2)
   - Respondent 16 (Assessment 3)
   Average: (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5

5. Session I-VF:
   - Respondent 13 (Assessment 2)
   Average: 2.0

6. Session V Hypoglycemia:
   - Respondent 17 (Assessment 3)
   Average: 3.0

7. Session II Anaphylactic Shock:
   - Respondent 6 (Assessment 2)
   Average: 2.0

Now, calculate the average for each session and check if it's greater than 1.5. All the averages here are 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, etc., which are all above 1.5. Wait, but let me confirm each:

- III Sepsis: 2.0 >1.5 → yes
- IV VT: 2.5 >1.5 → yes
- IV-Hypoglycemia: 3.0 >1.5 → yes
- I Myocardial Infarction: 2.5 >1.5 → yes
- I-VF: 2.0 >1.5 → yes
- V Hypoglycemia: 3.0 >1.5 → yes
- II Anaphylactic Shock: 2.0 >1.5 → yes

So all sessions have an average Assessment greater than 1.5. Therefore, all respondents are part of sessions that meet the criteria. Let's count all respondents:

Total respondents listed are 10 (from Respondent 6, 8, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 21, 22). Wait, the list in the data has 10 respondents. But let me count again:

Respondent numbers: 6,8,13,14,15,16,17,18,21,22. That's 10 respondents. Since all sessions have averages above 1.5, all 10 respondents should be counted. But wait, let me check again. Wait, in the example given in the problem, the answer was 0. But that was for a different question. Wait, no, the example is separate. The current task is different. 

Wait, but in the data provided, are there any sessions where the average Assessment is <=1.5? Let me recheck:

Looking at each session's average:

- III Sepsis: 2.0
- IV VT: 2.5
- IV-Hypoglycemia: 3.0
- I Myocardial Infarction: 2.5
- I-VF: 2.0
- V Hypoglycemia: 3.0
- II Anaphylactic Shock: 2.0

All of these are above 1.5. Therefore, all respondents are in sessions where the average Assessment is greater than 1.5. Therefore, the count should be 10. But let me check each respondent's session again to make sure.

Wait, but in the data, Respondent 6 is in Session II (Anaphylactic Shock) with Assessment 2. The average for that session is 2.0, which is above 1.5. So yes. All sessions meet the criteria. Therefore, all 10 respondents should be counted. But let me check the data again to confirm the number of respondents. The list in the questionnaire has 10 respondents: 6,8,13,14,15,16,17,18,21,22. That's 10. So the answer should be 10. But wait, the example answer was 0, but that was for a different question. So in this case, the correct answer is 10. But let me make sure I didn't miss any sessions. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in grouping. Let me recheck the grouping.

Wait, Respondent 8 is in ""III (Sepsis)"", and Respondent 15 is in ""III - Sepsis"". Are these considered the same session? The SessionName is written differently, but the content is Sepsis in both. So yes, grouped as III Sepsis. Similarly, IV (VT) and IV - VT are grouped as IV VT. I think that's correct. So all sessions have averages above 1.5. Therefore, all 10 respondents are counted. So the answer is 10.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose 'Background (examination)' is higher than the average 'Background (examination)' for all sessions on the same date.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents whose 'Background (examination)' score is higher than the average 'Background (examination)' score for all sessions on the same date. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The 'Background (examination)' is a rubric-based score ranging from 0 to 3. Each respondent has a date and a score for this category. 

The approach should be:
1. For each respondent, determine their date and their 'Background (examination)' score.
2. For each date, calculate the average 'Background (examination)' score of all respondents on that date.
3. Compare each respondent's score to the average of their respective date.
4. Count how many respondents have a score higher than their date's average.

Let's start by listing all respondents with their dates and 'Background (examination)' scores. From the data provided:

- Respondent 9: 2025-05-04, score 2
- Respondent 7: 2025-03-14, score 3
- Respondent 4: 2025-05-16, score 2
- Respondent 2: 2025-04-04, score 3
- Respondent 14: 2025-03-14, score 2
- Respondent 1: 2025-05-02, score 2
- Respondent 8: 2025-05-02, score 2
- Respondent 22: 2025-05-16, score 3
- Respondent 20: 2025-05-02, score -1 (Note: This might be an invalid entry, but we'll consider it as per data)

Next, group the respondents by date and calculate the average for each group.

Starting with 2025-03-14:
- Respondents: 7 (score 3), 14 (score 2)
- Total = 3 + 2 = 5
- Average = 5 / 2 = 2.5

2025-04-04:
- Respondent 2 (score 3)
- Average = 3

2025-05-02:
- Respondents: 1 (score 2), 8 (score 2), 20 (score -1)
- Total = 2 + 2 + (-1) = 3
- Average = 3 / 3 = 1

2025-05-04:
- Respondent 9 (score 2)
- Average = 2

2025-05-16:
- Respondents: 4 (score 2), 22 (score 3)
- Total = 2 + 3 = 5
- Average = 5 / 2 = 2.5

Now, compare each respondent's score to their date's average:

- Respondent 9 (2025-05-04, score 2 vs avg 2): 2 is not higher than 2 → no
- Respondent 7 (2025-03-14, 3 vs 2.5): 3 > 2.5 → yes
- Respondent 4 (2025-05-16, 2 vs 2.5): 2 < 2.5 → no
- Respondent 2 (2024-04-04, 3 vs 3 → no)
- Respondent 14 (2025-03-14, 2 vs 2.5 → no)
- Respondent 1 (2025-05-02, 2 vs 1 → yes)
- Respondent 8 (2025-05-02, 2 vs 1 → yes)
- Respondent 22 (2025-05-16, 3 vs 2.5 → yes)
- Respondent 20 (2025-05-02, -1 vs 1 → -1 < 1 → no)

Now count the 'yes' cases: Respondents 7, 1, 8, 22. That's 4 respondents. Wait, let me check again.

Wait, Respondent 20's score is -1. The rubric for 'Background (examination)' is 0-3, but the data shows -1 here. Since the problem doesn't mention handling invalid scores, we have to take the data as given. So for 2025-05-02, average is 1. So respondents on that date with scores higher than 1 are 1 (score 2) and 8 (score 2). Respondent 20's score is -1, which is below 1. So that's two respondents from 2025-05-02.

Respondent 7 (3 > 2.5) → yes.

Respondent 22 (3 > 2.5) → yes.

So total yes: 7, 1, 8, 22. That's four respondents. Wait, but let's recount:

Respondent 7: yes (1)
Respondent 1: yes (2)
Respondent 8: yes (3)
Respondent 22: yes (4)
Others: no.

So the total count is 4.

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the respondents who participated in a session where the average 'Assessment' for that session name is greater than 2.0.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents who participated in a session where the average 'Assessment' score for that session name is greater than 2.0. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The data provided includes multiple respondents, each with a 'SessionName' and an 'Assessment' score. The 'Assessment' rubric goes from 0 to 3. 

The key here is to group the respondents by their 'SessionName', calculate the average 'Assessment' score for each session, and then count how many respondents are in sessions where that average is above 2.0.

Let me start by listing all the respondents and their SessionNames along with their Assessment scores:

- Respondent 20: SessionName IV (VT), Assessment 3
- Respondent 2: SessionName MI, Assessment 3
- Respondent 15: SessionName III - Sepsis, Assessment 2
- Respondent 23: SessionName II-Anaphylaxsis, Assessment 3
- Respondent 22: SessionName IV (VT), Assessment 2
- Respondent 8: SessionName III (Sepsis), Assessment 2
- Respondent 19: SessionName I - MI, Assessment 2
- Respondent 13: SessionName I-VF, Assessment 2

Now, group them by SessionName:

1. IV (VT): Respondents 20 and 22. Assessments: 3 and 2. Average = (3+2)/2 = 2.5
2. MI: Respondent 2. Assessment: 3. Average = 3.0
3. III - Sepsis: Respondent 15. Assessment: 2. Average = 2.0
4. II-Anaphylaxsis: Respondent 23. Assessment: 3. Average = 3.0
5. III (Sepsis): Respondent 8. Assessment: 2. Average = 2.0
6. I - MI: Respondent 19. Assessment: 2. Average = 2.0
7. I-VF: Respondent 13. Assessment: 2. Average = 2.0

Wait, but I need to check if the SessionNames are considered the same if they have different formatting. For example, ""III - Sepsis"" vs. ""III (Sepsis)""—are these considered the same session? The SessionNames are written differently, so they should be treated as separate sessions. Similarly, ""MI"" and ""I - MI"" might be different sessions. So each unique SessionName as written is a separate group.

Now, calculate the average for each unique SessionName:

- IV (VT): 2.5 (which is greater than 2.0)
- MI: 3.0 (greater than 2.0)
- III - Sepsis: 2.0 (not greater)
- II-Anaphylaxsis: 3.0 (greater)
- III (Sepsis): 2.0 (not)
- I - MI: 2.0 (not)
- I-VF: 2.0 (not)

So the sessions with average >2.0 are IV (VT), MI, and II-Anaphylaxsis.

Now, count the respondents in these sessions:

- IV (VT): 2 respondents (20 and 22)
- MI: 1 respondent (2)
- II-Anaphylaxsis: 1 respondent (23)

Total respondents = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4.

Wait, but let me double-check. Respondent 2 is in MI, which has an average of 3.0. Respondent 23 is in II-Anaphylaxsis with 3.0. IV (VT) has two respondents. So 2+1+1=4. 

Therefore, the answer should be 4.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score across all rubric items is below the average total score for all sessions.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents whose total score across all rubric items is below the average total score for all sessions. 

First, I need to understand which fields in the responses are rubric items that contribute to the total score. Looking at the questions section, the rubric items are:

- Identification (0-3)
- Situation (0-3)
- Background (history) (0-3)
- Background (examination) (0-3)
- Assessment (0-3)
- Recommendation (clear recommendation) (0-3)
- Recommendation (global rating scale) (0-3)

So each respondent has 7 rubric items, each scored from 0 to 3. The total score for each respondent would be the sum of these seven scores.

Next, I need to calculate the total score for each respondent. Let's go through each respondent one by one.

Starting with Respondent 8:
- Identification: 3
- Situation: 3
- Background (history): 3
- Background (examination): 2
- Assessment: 2
- Recommendation (clear recommendation): 2
- Recommendation (global rating scale): 3
Total = 3+3+3+2+2+2+3 = 18

Respondent 18:
3 +3 +2 +2 +3 +2 +2 = 17

Respondent 7:
3 +3 +2 +3 +2 +2 +2 = 17

Respondent 2:
3 +3 +2 +3 +3 +2 +1 = 17

Respondent 5:
3 +3 +3 +3 +3 +2 +3 = 20

Respondent 17:
3 +3 +3 +3 +3 +3 +2 = 20

Respondent 10:
2 +2 +2 +2 +2 +2 +2 = 14

Respondent 23:
3 +3 +2 +2 +3 +3 +3 = 19

Respondent 14:
3 +3 +2 +2 +3 +1 +2 = 16

Respondent 12:
3 +3 +3 +3 +2 +3 +3 = 20

Respondent 22:
3 +3 +3 +3 +2 +2 +3 = 19

Now, let's list all the total scores:
18, 17, 17, 17, 20, 20, 14, 19, 16, 20, 19

Next, calculate the average total score. Sum all these totals and divide by the number of respondents (11).

Sum = 18+17+17+17+20+20+14+19+16+20+19 = Let's compute step by step:

18 +17 = 35
35 +17 = 52
52 +17 = 69
69 +20 = 89
89 +20 = 109
109 +14 = 123
123 +19 = 142
142 +16 = 158
158 +20 = 178
178 +19 = 197

Total sum is 197. Average = 197 / 11 ≈ 17.909, which is approximately 17.91.

Now, we need to find how many respondents have a total score below this average. The average is about 17.91, so scores below 17.91 are 17 and below.

Looking at the totals:
- 18: above average
- 17: below (three times)
- 20: above
- 14: below
- 19: above
- 16: below
- 20: above
- 19: above
- 20: above
- 19: above

Wait, let's list each respondent's total again:

Respondent 8: 18 (above)
Respondent 18:17 (below)
Respondent7:17 (below)
Respondent2:17 (below)
Respondent5:20 (above)
Respondent17:20 (above)
Respondent10:14 (below)
Respondent23:19 (above)
Respondent14:16 (below)
Respondent12:20 (above)
Respondent22:19 (above)

So the scores below 17.91 are: 17,17,17,14,16. That's 5 respondents.

Wait, let's count again:

Respondent18:17 (1)
Respondent7:17 (2)
Respondent2:17 (3)
Respondent10:14 (4)
Respondent14:16 (5)

Yes, 5 respondents have total scores below the average of ~17.91.

Therefore, the answer should be 5.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose 'Assessment' is higher than the average 'Assessment' for all sessions on the same date.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents whose 'Assessment' score is higher than the average 'Assessment' score for all sessions on the same date. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The 'Assessment' field is a rubric-based score ranging from 0 to 3. Each respondent has a date, and their 'Assessment' score. The goal is to compare each respondent's 'Assessment' score to the average of all respondents on the same date.

So, the steps I need to follow are:

1. **Group respondents by date**: For each date, calculate the average 'Assessment' score.
2. **Compare each respondent's score**: For each respondent, check if their 'Assessment' score is higher than the average of their group (same date).
3. **Count the number of such respondents**: Tally up all respondents who meet the condition.

Let's start by listing all the respondents and their dates and 'Assessment' scores from the provided data:

- **Respondent 19**: Date 2025-05-16, Assessment 2
- **Respondent 20**: Date 2025-05-02, Assessment 3
- **Respondent 11**: Date 2025-04-04, Assessment 3
- **Respondent 8**: Date 2025-05-02, Assessment 2
- **Respondent 10**: Date 2025-03-14, Assessment 2
- **Respondent 5**: Date 2025-05-04, Assessment 3
- **Respondent 17**: Date 2025-05-04, Assessment 3
- **Respondent 22**: Date 2025-05-16, Assessment 2
- **Respondent 7**: Date 2025-03-14, Assessment 2
- **Respondent 18**: Date 2025-05-04, Assessment 3

Now, group them by date:

**2025-05-16**:
- Respondent 19: 2
- Respondent 22: 2
Average = (2 + 2) / 2 = 2.0

**2025-05-02**:
- Respondent 20: 3
- Respondent 8: 2
Average = (3 + 2) / 2 = 2.5

**2025-04-04**:
- Respondent 11: 3
Average = 3 / 1 = 3.0

**2025-03-14**:
- Respondent 10: 2
- Respondent 7: 2
Average = (2 + 2) / 2 = 2.0

**2025-05-04**:
- Respondent 5: 3
- Respondent 17: 3
- Respondent 18: 3
Average = (3 + 3 + 3) / 3 = 3.0

Now, compare each respondent's 'Assessment' score to their date's average:

- **Respondent 19 (2 vs 2.0)**: 2 is not higher than 2.0 → No
- **Respondent 20 (3 vs 2.5)**: 3 > 2.5 → Yes
- **Respondent 11 (3 vs 3.0)**: 3 is not higher than 3.0 → No
- **Respondent 8 (2 vs 2.5)**: 2 < 2.5 → No
- **Respondent 10 (2 vs 2.0)**: 2 is not higher → No
- **Respondent 5 (3 vs 3.0)**: Equal → No
- **Respondent 17 (3 vs 3.0)**: Equal → No
- **Respondent 22 (2 vs 2.0)**: Equal → No
- **Respondent 7 (2 vs 2.0)**: Equal → No
- **Respondent 18 (3 vs 3.0)**: Equal → No

Only Respondent 20 has an 'Assessment' score higher than the average for their date. Therefore, the count is 1.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' score is equal to the average 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' score for all sessions that occurred on the same date.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the number of respondents whose 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' score is equal to the average score of that same field for all sessions on the same date. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' is a rubric-based score with possible values 0 to 3. Each respondent has a date and a score for this field. 

The steps I need to follow are:

1. **Calculate the average 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' score for each date.**
   - For each unique date in the responses, compute the average of all 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' scores from respondents on that date.
   
2. **For each respondent, compare their score to the average score of their respective date.**
   - If a respondent's score matches the average of their date, include them in the count.

3. **Count all such respondents.**

Let's start by listing all the respondents and their dates along with their 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' scores.

Looking at the responses:

- **Respondent 2**: Date 2025-04-04, Score 2
- **Respondent 18**: Date 2025-05-04, Score 2
- **Respondent 19**: Date 2025-05-16, Score 3
- **Respondent 6**: Date 2025-04-04, Score 2
- **Respondent 14**: Date 2025-03-14, Score 1
- **Respondent 22**: Date 2025-05-16, Score 2
- **Respondent 16**: Date 2025-05-02, Score 2
- **Respondent 23**: Date 2025-03-14, Score 3
- **Respondent 20**: Date 2025-05-02, Score 2
- **Respondent 11**: Date 2025-04-04, Score 3

Now, group them by date:

**2025-03-14**:
- Respondent 14: 1
- Respondent 23: 3
Average = (1 + 3)/2 = 2.0

**2025-04-04**:
- Respondent 2: 2
- Respondent 6: 2
- Respondent 11: 3
Average = (2 + 2 + 3)/3 = 7/3 ≈ 2.333...

**2025-05-02**:
- Respondent 16: 2
- Respondent 20: 2
Average = (2 + 2)/2 = 2.0

**2025-05-04**:
- Respondent 18: 2
Average = 2.0 (only one respondent)

**2025-05-16**:
- Respondent 19: 3
- Respondent 22: 2
Average = (3 + 2)/2 = 2.5

Next, for each respondent, check if their score equals the average of their date:

- **2025-03-14** (Average 2.0):
  - Respondent 14: 1 ≠ 2 → No
  - Respondent 23: 3 ≠ 2 → No

- **2025-04-04** (Average ≈2.333):
  - Respondent 2: 2 → 2.333 → No
  - Respondent 6: 2 → No
  - Respondent 11: 3 → No

- **2025-05-02** (Average 2.0):
  - Respondent 16: 2 = 2 → Yes
  - Respondent 20: 2 = 2 → Yes

- **2025-05-04** (Average 2.0):
  - Respondent 18: 2 = 2 → Yes

- **2025-05-16** (Average 2.5):
  - Respondent 19: 3 ≠ 2.5 → No
  - Respondent 22: 2 ≠ 2.5 → No

So, the respondents who meet the condition are:
- Respondent 16
- Respondent 20
- Respondent 18

Total count: 3

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose 'Background (examination)' is higher than the average 'Background (examination)' for all sessions on the same date.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents whose 'Background (examination)' score is higher than the average 'Background (examination)' score for all sessions on the same date. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The dataset has multiple respondents, each with a Date and a 'Background (examination)' score. The 'Background (examination)' is a rubric-based score from 0 to 3. 

The plan is:
1. For each respondent, determine their date and their 'Background (examination)' score.
2. For each date, calculate the average 'Background (examination)' score of all respondents on that date.
3. Compare each respondent's score to the average of their respective date.
4. Count how many respondents have a score higher than their date's average.

Let's start by listing all respondents with their dates and 'Background (examination)' scores:

- Respondent 17: 2025-05-04, score 3
- Respondent 11: 2025-04-04, score 3
- Respondent 14: 2025-03-14, score 2
- Respondent 21: 2025-05-16, score 1
- Respondent 5: 2025-05-04, score 3
- Respondent 10: 2025-03-14, score 2
- Respondent 13: 2025-03-14, score 1
- Respondent 6: 2025-04-04, score 3
- Respondent 23: 2025-03-14, score 2
- Respondent 9: 2025-05-04, score 2
- Respondent 8: 2025-05-02, score 2

Now, group them by date and calculate the average for each date:

1. 2025-05-04: Respondents 17, 5, 9. Scores: 3, 3, 2. Sum = 8. Average = 8/3 ≈ 2.666...
2. 2025-04-04: Respondents 11, 6. Scores: 3, 3. Sum = 6. Average = 6/2 = 3
3. 2025-03-14: Respondents 14, 10, 13, 23. Scores: 2, 2, 1, 2. Sum = 7. Average = 7/4 = 1.75
4. 2025-05-16: Respondent 21. Score 1. Average = 1
5. 2025-05-02: Respondent 8. Score 2. Average = 2

Now, compare each respondent's score to their date's average:

- Respondent 17 (2025-05-04, 3 vs 2.666...): 3 > 2.666 → Yes
- Respondent 11 (2025-04-04, 3 vs 3): 3 is not higher → No
- Respondent 14 (2025-03-14, 2 vs 1.75): 2 > 1.75 → Yes
- Respondent 21 (2025-05-16, 1 vs 1): No
- Respondent 5 (2025-05-04, 3 vs 2.666...): Yes
- Respondent 10 (2025-03-14, 2 vs 1.75): Yes
- Respondent 13 (2025-03-14, 1 vs 1.75): No
- Respondent 6 (2024-04-04, 3 vs 3): No
- Respondent 23 (2025-03-14, 2 vs 1.75): Yes
- Respondent 9 (2025-05-04, 2 vs 2.666...): No
- Respondent 8 (2025-05-02, 2 vs 2): No

Now count the ""Yes"" cases: Respondents 17, 14, 5, 10, 23. That's 5 respondents.
