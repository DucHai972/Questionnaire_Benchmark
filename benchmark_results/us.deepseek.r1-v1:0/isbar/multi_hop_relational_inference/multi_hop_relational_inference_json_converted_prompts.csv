<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondents participated in the same session name as respondent '9'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find which respondents participated in the same session name as respondent '9'. First, I need to find out what session name respondent '9' has.

Looking at the responses, I'll search for the entry where the respondent is '9'. Here it is:

Respondent 9:
- SessionName: ""II (Anaphylaxsis)""

Wait, the session name here is ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"". Now, I need to check if there are other respondents with the same session name. But I should also consider possible variations in the session names. For example, maybe some entries have typos or different formatting, like hyphens instead of parentheses.

Looking through the other responses:

Respondent 12: ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" – note the spelling is Anaphylaxis, not Anaphylaxsis. That's a different spelling. But maybe it's a typo? The session name for 12 is ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" and for 9 it's ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"". The difference is the 's' in Anaphylaxsis. Wait, Anaphylaxis is the correct medical term, but the data might have a typo. However, as per the data provided, we have to take the exact strings as they are. So ""Anaphylaxsis"" vs. ""Anaphylaxis"" would be considered different session names unless they are actually the same but misspelled. But according to the data, we must treat them as different unless specified otherwise.

Next, respondent 5: ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" – here, the session name is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"". The hyphen instead of parentheses. But the core part is ""Anaphylaxsis"". So the session name is similar to respondent 9's, but formatted differently. The question is whether the session name is considered the same if the formatting differs. For example, ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"" vs. ""II - Anaphylaxsis"". The task is to match the session name exactly as per the data. So if the names are not identical, they are different. But perhaps the session name is intended to be the same, and the formatting differences are just variations. However, the problem states to use the data as given. So unless the session names are exactly the same string, they are considered different.

Wait, looking at respondent 5's session name: ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" (with a hyphen) and respondent 9's ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"" (with parentheses). The actual session name part after the numeral might be considered the same, but the way it's written is different. However, the problem is about the exact session name. So unless the data entry has a typo, we have to treat them as different. But let's check the exact strings.

Respondent 5: ""II - Anaphylaxsis""
Respondent 9: ""II (Anaphylaxsis)""
Respondent 12: ""II (Anaphylaxis)""

So, the session names for 5 and 9 both have ""Anaphylaxsis"" but different separators. The session name for 12 is ""Anaphylaxis"" with an 'i' instead of 's' in the suffix. So, unless there's a typo, these are different sessions. But according to the data, we have to take them as they are. Therefore, the only respondent with the exact same session name as 9 is respondent 5? Wait, no. Wait, respondent 5's session name is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" and 9's is ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"". The difference is the separator between the numeral and the name: hyphen vs. parentheses. So the session names are not exactly the same. Therefore, perhaps there are no other respondents with the same session name as 9. Wait, but maybe the hyphen and parentheses are considered part of the same session name. For example, if the session is ""II"" and the name is ""Anaphylaxsis"", but the formatting is different. But according to the data, the session name is the entire string. So ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"" and ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" are different session names. Therefore, respondent 9's session name is unique. But wait, let's check again.

Wait, respondent 9's session name is ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"", and respondent 5's is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"". The only difference is the separator. If the separator is part of the session name, then they are different. So, in that case, respondent 9 is the only one with that exact session name. But maybe the system considers ""II"" as the session number and the rest as the name, but the problem states to use the session name as given. Therefore, the answer would be that no other respondents have the same session name as 9. But wait, let's check all responses again.

Looking through all responses:

Respondent 12: ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" – different spelling.
Respondent 5: ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" – different separator.
Respondent 8: ""III (Sepsis)""
Respondent 4: ""III (Sepsis)""
Respondent 22: ""IV (VT)""
Respondent 7: ""III-Sepsis""
Respondent 3: ""III-Sepsis""
Respondent 10: ""(MI)-VT""

So, the only other respondent with ""Anaphylaxsis"" in the session name is 5, but the separator is different. Therefore, unless the separator is considered insignificant, they are different. Since the problem says to use the data as given, the session names must match exactly. Therefore, respondent 9's session name is ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"", and no one else has that exact string. Wait, respondent 5's session name is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"". The separator is a hyphen, not parentheses. So they are different. Therefore, the answer would be that no other respondents share the same session name as 9. But wait, let me check again. Maybe I missed someone.

Wait, respondent 9's session name is ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"". Are there any other respondents with that exact string? Let's check all:

- 12: ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" – different spelling (Anaphylaxis vs. Anaphylaxsis)
- 5: ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" – different separator
- 9: ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"" – the target
- Others have different session names.

So, no other respondents have the exact session name as 9. Therefore, the answer is none. But wait, the example given in the problem had a similar scenario where the answer was ""None"". But let me confirm again. The task is to find respondents who participated in the same session name as respondent 9. If no one else has the exact same session name, then the answer is none. But perhaps the hyphen vs. parentheses is a typo, and they are considered the same. However, according to the data, we must treat them as different unless they are identical. Therefore, the answer is that there are no other respondents with the same session name as 9. So the answer is ""None"".

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondents participated in the same session name as respondent '9'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find which respondents participated in the same session name as respondent '9'. First, I need to figure out what session name respondent '9' has.

Looking at the responses, I'll go through each entry until I find the one with respondent '9'. Here it is: respondent '9' has the SessionName ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"". Now, I need to check all other respondents to see if any of them have the same SessionName. 

Let me go through each response one by one. 

Respondent '5' has SessionName ""II - Anaphylaxsis"". Hmm, the name is similar but has a hyphen instead of parentheses. Wait, the exact string matters here. The original data for respondent '9' is ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"", while respondent '5' is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"". The difference in punctuation (parentheses vs. hyphen) might mean they are considered different session names. But maybe it's a typo? The problem says ""same session name"", so exact match is required. So '5' might not be a match.

Next, respondent '15' has ""III - Sepsis"", which is different. Respondent '3' has ""III-Sepsis"" (with a hyphen), different. Respondent '16' is ""I - MI"", different. Respondent '22' is ""IV (VT)"", not matching. Respondent '10' is ""(MI)-VT"", different. 

Then respondent '9' is our target. Next, respondent '2' has ""MI"", not matching. Respondent '6' has ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"", which is similar but the session name is different. Finally, respondent '17' has ""V (Hypoglycemia)"", which is different. 

Wait, but let me check again. Are there any other respondents with ""II (Anaphylaxsis)""? Respondent '9' is the only one with that exact SessionName. The others have variations like ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" (respondent '5') and ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"" (respondent '6'). Since the names aren't exactly the same, they don't match. 

Therefore, no other respondents share the exact session name as respondent '9'. The answer should be None.

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
List all respondents who scored the same on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' as respondent '15'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to list all respondents who scored the same on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' as respondent '15'. 

First, I need to find out what score respondent 15 has for that particular question. Let me look through the responses.

Looking at the responses array, each respondent has a ""respondent"" key. I need to find the one with ""respondent"": ""15"". 

Here's the entry for respondent 15:
{
  ""respondent"": ""15"",
  ""answers"": {
    ""Date"": ""2025-05-04"",
    ""SessionName"": ""III - Sepsis"",
    ""Identification"": 3,
    ""Situation"": 3,
    ""Background (history)"": 2,
    ""Background (examination)"": 3,
    ""Assessment"": 2,
    ""Recommendation (clear recommendation)"": 2,
    ""Recommendation (global rating scale)"": 2,
    ""Comments"": ""Detailed Response - clear communication""
  }
}

So, the score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' is 2. 

Now, I need to check all other respondents to see who else has a score of 2 in that category. Let's go through each respondent one by one.

Respondent 3: Their 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' is 3. Not a match.

Respondent 21: Score is 3. Not a match.

Respondent 23: Score is 3. No.

Respondent 20: Score is 2. That's a match. So respondent 20 is included.

Respondent 17: Score is 3. No.

Respondent 13: Score is 2. Another match. So respondent 13.

Respondent 2: Score is 2. Another match. Respondent 2.

Respondent 8: Score is 2. That's another one. So respondent 8.

Wait, let me double-check each to make sure I didn't miss any.

Looking again:

- Respondent 3: 3
- 21:3
- 23:3
- 20:2 ✅
- 17:3
- 13:2 ✅
- 15:2 (but we exclude 15 as per the task? Wait, the task says ""all respondents who scored the same... as respondent '15'"", so including 15? Wait, the example in the problem given earlier was about excluding the respondent themselves, but in this task, the instruction is to list all, including 15? Wait, the example had a similar task but excluded the respondent. Let me check the task again.

The current task says: ""List all respondents who scored the same on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' as respondent '15'."" There's no mention of excluding respondent 15. So, should we include 15 in the list? Wait, but in the example, the answer was ""None"" because the respondent 19 wasn't in the data. But in this case, the task is to include all, including 15? Or is there a possibility that the task wants others with the same score, excluding 15? The wording is ambiguous. Let me check the exact wording again.

The task says: ""List all respondents who scored the same on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' as respondent '15'."" So, it's possible that the answer includes respondent 15 themselves. But in the example given, when the task was to find respondents on the same date as 19 (which wasn't present), the answer was ""None"". But in this case, the question is about the same score. So, if respondent 15 has a score of 2, and others have 2, then the list would include 15 and others. But the example in the problem (the first one) excluded the respondent themselves. Wait, in the example, the user asked to exclude the respondent themselves. But in this task, the user hasn't specified to exclude. So, perhaps the answer should include all, including 15. But let me check the example again.

In the example, the user's task was: ""Find all respondents who had a session on the same date as respondent '19', excluding the respondent themselves."" The answer was ""None"" because there was no respondent 19 in the data. So, the example included the exclusion clause. But in the current task, there's no such exclusion. Therefore, the answer should include all respondents with the same score, including 15. However, the user might have intended to exclude 15, but the task as written does not state that. So, I need to follow the exact instructions. The task says ""all respondents"", so including 15. But let me check the data again to confirm.

Looking at the responses:

Respondent 15's score is 2. Now, checking others:

Respondent 20: 2 ✅

Respondent 13: 2 ✅

Respondent 2: 2 ✅

Respondent 8: 2 ✅

So, these four respondents (15, 20, 13, 2, 8) have a score of 2. Wait, but 15 is the one we're comparing to. So, the answer should include 15 and the others. But the example in the problem excluded the respondent themselves. Wait, the example's task was to exclude, but this task doesn't say that. So, unless the user made a mistake, but according to the current task, we should include all, including 15. However, perhaps the user intended to exclude, but the task doesn't state that. Let me check the task again.

The task is: ""List all respondents who scored the same on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' as respondent '15'."" So, if 15 has a score of 2, then all respondents (including 15) with 2 should be listed. But perhaps the user wants to exclude 15. But the example had an exclusion clause, but this task doesn't. So, perhaps the answer includes 15. However, in the example, the answer was ""None"" because there was no respondent 19, but in the data provided, there was no respondent 19. So, the example's answer was correct. 

In this case, the answer should include all respondents with the same score as 15, including 15. But let me check the data again. Wait, the respondents are:

Respondent 15: 2

Respondent 20: 2

Respondent 13: 2

Respondent 2: 2

Respondent 8: 2

So that's five respondents. Wait, no. Let me list all:

Looking at each response:

- Respondent 3: 3

- 21:3

- 23:3

- 20:2

- 17:3

- 13:2

- 15:2

- 2:2

- 8:2

So, respondents 20,13,15,2,8 have 2. That's five respondents. But the task says ""list all respondents"", so including 15. But maybe the user expects to exclude 15. But the task doesn't say to exclude. So, the answer should be 15,20,13,2,8. But let me check again. Wait, the example had a similar structure but excluded the respondent. But in this case, the task doesn't mention exclusion. Therefore, the answer should include all, including 15. However, perhaps the user made a mistake and intended to exclude, but according to the given task, we should include. 

But wait, looking back at the data, the respondents with 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' score 2 are:

- 20:2

- 13:2

- 15:2

- 2:2

- 8:2

So that's five respondents. But the answer should list all of them. However, the user might have intended to exclude 15. But the task doesn't state that. Therefore, the correct answer is 15,20,13,2,8. But let me check again. Wait, the example in the problem had the answer ""None"" because there was no respondent 19. So, in that case, the answer was correct. Here, the answer should list all respondents with the same score as 15, including 15. But perhaps the user expects to exclude 15. But the task doesn't say that. So, the answer should include 15. But let me check the data again. 

Wait, the task is to list all respondents who scored the same as respondent 15. So, if 15 is part of that group, then yes. So, the answer is 15,20,13,2,8. But the user might have intended to exclude 15. But the task doesn't specify that. Therefore, the answer should include all, including 15. However, in the example, the user excluded the respondent themselves. But that example had an explicit instruction to exclude. Here, there's no such instruction. Therefore, the answer should include 15. 

But wait, looking at the data again, the respondents are:

Respondent 15: 2

Respondent 20:2

Respondent 13:2

Respondent 2:2

Respondent 8:2

So, the list is 15,20,13,2,8. But the output format says for a list of names or IDs, provide a comma-separated list. So, the answer should be ""15,20,13,2,8"". However, the order in the data is 3,21,23,20,17,13,15,2,8. So, the order in the list may not matter. 

But let me confirm once more. The task is to list all respondents with the same score as 15. So, 15 is included. Therefore, the answer is 15,20,13,2,8. But wait, in the data, the respondents are:

Looking at the responses array:

The order is:

3,21,23,20,17,13,15,2,8.

So, the respondents with score 2 are:

20,13,15,2,8. So, the answer is 20,13,15,2,8. But when listed, the order may not matter. However, the output should be a simple comma-separated list. So, the answer is ""15,20,13,2,8"" or in the order they appear in the data. But perhaps the order is not important. 

But wait, the user might have intended to exclude 15. Let me check the task again. The task says ""all respondents who scored the same... as respondent '15'"". So, that includes 15. Therefore, the answer is 15,20,13,2,8. But let me check the data again to make sure I didn't miss any. 

Yes, those are the five respondents. So, the final answer is 15,20,13,2,8.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondents participated in the same session name as respondent '2'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find which respondents participated in the same session name as respondent '2'. 

First, I need to locate respondent '2' in the data. Let me look through the responses. Here's respondent '2':

{
  ""respondent"": ""2"",
  ""answers"": {
    ""Date"": ""2025-04-04"",
    ""SessionName"": ""MI"",
    ...
  }
}

So, the SessionName for respondent '2' is ""MI"". Now, I need to find all other respondents who have the same SessionName. But wait, the SessionName might have variations. For example, ""MI"" could be written as ""I - MI"" or ""I (Myocardial infarction)"". Let me check the SessionNames of other respondents.

Looking at the responses:

- Respondent 23: ""II-Anaphylaxsis""
- Respondent 3: ""III-Sepsis""
- Respondent 17: ""V (Hypoglycemia)""
- Respondent 6: ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)""
- Respondent 2: ""MI""
- Respondent 8: ""III (Sepsis)""
- Respondent 15: ""III - Sepsis""
- Respondent 21: ""I (Myocardial infarction)""
- Respondent 9: ""II (Anaphylaxsis)""
- Respondent 16: ""I - MI""

Hmm, respondent 16 has ""I - MI"" as their SessionName. ""MI"" is part of that name. Also, respondent 21 has ""I (Myocardial infarction)"", which is another way to refer to MI (Myocardial Infarction). But the question is about the same SessionName. The exact SessionName for respondent '2' is ""MI"". 

Looking at respondent 16: ""I - MI"" includes ""MI"", but is that considered the same session name? The problem states ""same session name"", so I need to check if ""MI"" matches exactly. ""I - MI"" is different from ""MI"". Similarly, ""I (Myocardial infarction)"" is a different name. So, only respondents with SessionName exactly ""MI"" would be considered. 

Wait, but respondent 2's SessionName is ""MI"", and respondent 16's is ""I - MI"". Are these considered the same? The problem might consider variations, but according to the data, each SessionName is a specific string. Unless there's a note that MI is equivalent to I - MI, but the data doesn't mention that. So, strictly by the given data, only exact matches count. 

Therefore, only respondent '2' has SessionName ""MI"". But let me check again. Wait, respondent 16's SessionName is ""I - MI"". The ""I"" here might indicate a different session number or part, so ""I - MI"" is a different session name. Therefore, no other respondents have the exact SessionName ""MI"" except respondent '2'. 

But wait, maybe ""MI"" is an abbreviation, and others have the full name. For example, ""I (Myocardial infarction)"" is another way to write MI. But the SessionName is a specific string. The problem is asking for the same SessionName, not the same medical condition. So, unless the SessionName is exactly the same, they are different. 

Therefore, the answer would be that no other respondents have the same SessionName as respondent '2'. But let me check again. Wait, respondent 16's SessionName is ""I - MI"". The ""MI"" here is part of the name. If the SessionName is considered to be ""MI"" regardless of the prefix, but according to the data, the exact names are different. So, the answer is that only respondent '2' has ""MI"", so no others. But the task is to find respondents who participated in the same session name as respondent '2', excluding themselves. So, the answer would be none. 

Wait, but maybe ""MI"" is a shorthand, and others have similar names. Let me check all SessionNames again:

- Respondent 2: ""MI""
- Respondent 16: ""I - MI""
- Respondent 21: ""I (Myocardial infarction)""

So, ""MI"" could stand for Myocardial Infarction. But the SessionNames are different. Unless the system groups these as the same session, but according to the data, they are different. Therefore, the answer is that no other respondents have the exact SessionName ""MI"" except respondent '2', so the answer is none. 

But wait, maybe ""I - MI"" is part of the same session series. For example, ""I"" could be the session number, and ""MI"" the topic. But the problem states ""same session name"", so the name must match exactly. Therefore, the answer is that there are no other respondents with the same SessionName as respondent '2'.
</think>

16, 21

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**
1. **Identify Respondent 2's Session Name:** Respondent '2' has the SessionName ""MI"".
2. **Find Matching SessionNames:** Check all other respondents for the exact SessionName ""MI"".
3. **Analyze Variations:** 
   - Respondent 16: ""I - MI"" (includes ""MI"" but is a different full name)
   - Respondent 21: ""I (Myocardial infarction)"" (refers to MI but different naming)
4. **Conclusion:** No exact matches for ""MI"" except respondent '2'. However, if considering ""I - MI"" and ""I (Myocardial infarction)"" as equivalent to ""MI"" based on context (MI being Myocardial Infarction), then respondents 16 and 21 are included.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents who scored the same on 'Background (history)' as respondent '13'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to list all respondents who scored the same on 'Background (history)' as respondent '13'. First, I need to find out what score respondent 13 got for 'Background (history)'.

Looking at the responses section, I'll search for the respondent with ID '13'. Here's the entry for respondent 13:

{
  ""respondent"": ""13"",
  ""answers"": {
    ...
    ""Background (history)"": 2,
    ...
  }
}

So, the score for 'Background (history)' is 2. Now, I need to find all other respondents who also have a score of 2 in that category, excluding respondent 13 themselves.

Next, I'll go through each respondent in the responses list and check their 'Background (history)' score.

- Respondent 12: Their 'Background (history)' is 3. Doesn't match.
- Respondent 23: Score is 2. That's a match.
- Respondent 10: Score is 2. Another match.
- Respondent 14: Score is 2. Also a match.
- Respondent 11: Score is 3. Doesn't match.
- Respondent 2: Score is 2. That's a match.

Wait, let me double-check each one to be sure. 

Respondent 23: Yes, 2. 
Respondent 10: 2. 
Respondent 14: 2. 
Respondent 2: 2. 

So the respondents with the same score as 13 (which is 2) are 23, 10, 14, and 2. 

But wait, the task says to exclude the respondent themselves. Since we're looking for others with the same score, we need to exclude respondent 13 from the list. The other respondents are 23, 10, 14, and 2. 

So the final list should be these four IDs. Let me confirm once more by checking each entry:

- 23: 2 ✔️
- 10: 2 ✔️
- 14: 2 ✔️
- 2: 2 ✔️

Yes, that's correct. All these respondents have a 'Background (history)' score of 2, same as respondent 13. Therefore, the answer should be a comma-separated list of these IDs.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents who scored the same on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' as respondent '13'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The goal is to find all respondents who scored the same on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' as respondent '13'. First, I need to locate respondent '13' in the data and check their score for that specific question.

Looking through the responses, I see that each respondent has an ""answers"" object. Let me find the one with ""respondent"": ""13"". Here it is. Their answers for ""Recommendation (clear recommendation)"" is 2. 

Now, I need to go through all other respondents and check if their score for the same question is also 2. Let's list them out:

- Respondent 12: Their score is 3. So, no match.
- Respondent 10: Their score is 2. That's a match.
- Respondent 21: Their score is 3. No match.
- Respondent 5: Score is 2. Another match.
- Respondent 3: Score is 3. No.
- Respondent 22: Score is 2. That's a third match.

Wait, wait. Wait, the original respondent is 13, so we need to exclude them from the list. But the task says ""excluding the respondent themselves"" like in the example. Wait, the example was about dates, but the current task is about scores. The task here is to list all respondents with the same score as '13', but not including '13' themselves. So, in this case, respondent 13 has a score of 2. The other respondents with score 2 are 10, 5, and 22. Let me double-check each:

Respondent 10: 2. Correct.
Respondent 5: 2. Correct.
Respondent 22: 2. Correct.

So the answer should be respondents 10, 5, and 22. Let me make sure there are no others. The responses list includes 12,10,21,13,5,3,22. So yes, those three are the ones with score 2, excluding 13.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents who scored the same on 'Assessment' as respondent '5'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The goal is to find all respondents who scored the same on 'Assessment' as respondent '5'. 

First, I need to locate respondent '5' in the data. Looking through the responses, here's the entry for respondent '5':

{
  ""respondent"": ""5"",
  ""answers"": {
    ...
    ""Assessment"": 3,
    ...
  }
}

So, the 'Assessment' score for respondent '5' is 3.

Now, I need to check all other respondents and see who else has an 'Assessment' score of 3. Let's go through each respondent one by one.

- Respondent 21: Assessment is 2. Not a match.
- Respondent 11: Assessment is 3. Match.
- Respondent 17: Assessment is 3. Match.
- Respondent 3: Assessment is 3. Match.
- Respondent 14: Assessment is 3. Match.
- Respondent 20: Assessment is 3. Match.
- Respondent 12: Assessment is 2. Not a match.
- Respondent 1: Assessment is 3. Match.
- Respondent 6: Assessment is 2. Not a match.
- Respondent 23: Assessment is 3. Match.

Wait, let me double-check each to avoid mistakes. 

Looking again:

- Respondent 11: 3 ✔️
- Respondent 17: 3 ✔️
- Respondent 3: 3 ✔️
- Respondent 14: 3 ✔️
- Respondent 20: 3 ✔️
- Respondent 1: 3 ✔️
- Respondent 23: 3 ✔️

So the respondents with 'Assessment' score 3 are 5, 11, 17, 3, 14, 20, 1, 23. But the task says to exclude the respondent themselves (5), so we remove 5 from the list. 

Therefore, the final list should be respondents 11, 17, 3, 14, 20, 1, 23. Let me check once more to ensure none are missed or incorrectly included. All these have 'Assessment' 3, and 5 is excluded. 

Yes, that's correct.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents who scored the same on 'Background (history)' as respondent '16'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The goal is to find all respondents who scored the same on 'Background (history)' as respondent '16'. First, I need to locate respondent 16 in the responses.

Looking through the responses list, I see that respondent 16 has their answers. The 'Background (history)' score is 3. Now, I need to check all other respondents to see who else has a score of 3 in that category.

Checking respondent 7: their 'Background (history)' is 2. Not a match. Respondent 11 has 3, so that's a match. Respondent 23 has 2. Respondent 8 has 3. Respondent 5 has 3. Respondent 18 has 2. 

So the respondents with a score of 3 in 'Background (history)' are 11, 16, 8, and 5. But wait, the task says to exclude the respondent themselves if necessary. Wait, the task says ""all respondents who scored the same as respondent '16'"", so including 16? Let me check the original question again. The example had a similar task where they excluded the respondent themselves, but in this case, the task doesn't specify excluding. Wait, the example was about the same date, excluding themselves. But here, the task is about the same score. The example's answer was ""None"" because maybe there were no others. But in this case, the task is to list all, including 16? Wait, the example's data might not have others, but here, the question is different. Let me recheck.

The task says: ""List all respondents who scored the same on 'Background (history)' as respondent '16'."" So it's possible that 16 is included unless the task says to exclude. But the example's task was to exclude, but this one doesn't mention excluding. So I should include all, including 16. Wait, but looking at the data:

Respondent 16's 'Background (history)' is 3. Other respondents with 3 are 11, 8, 5. So the answer should be 11, 16, 8, 5? Wait, no. Wait, respondent 11: 3, 16:3, 8:3, 5:3. So all four. But wait, let me check each one again.

Looking at each response:

- Respondent 7: 2
- 11:3
- 16:3
- 23:2
- 8:3
- 5:3
- 18:2

So the respondents with 3 are 11, 16, 8, 5. So the answer should be these four. But the task says ""all respondents"", so including 16. Unless the task is to exclude 16. Wait, the example had a similar instruction where they excluded the respondent themselves. Let me check the example again. The example's task was: ""Find all respondents who had a session on the same date as respondent '19', excluding the respondent themselves."" So in that case, they excluded. But in the current task, the instruction is ""List all respondents who scored the same... as respondent '16'."" The example's answer was ""None"" because maybe there were no others. But in our current data, there are others. So unless the current task also says to exclude, but it doesn't. So the answer should include 16 and others. Wait, but maybe the user expects to exclude 16? Let me check the exact wording again.

The task says: ""List all respondents who scored the same on 'Background (history)' as respondent '16'."" The wording doesn't say to exclude, so we should include all, including 16. But in the example, the answer was ""None"" even though there were two entries with the same date (respondent 7 and 23 on 2025-03-14, but the example's answer was ""None"" because maybe respondent 19 wasn't in the data. Wait, in the example data, the respondents are 7,11,16,23,8,5,18. The example's task was about respondent 19, which isn't present, hence the answer was ""None"". So in this case, the current task is about respondent 16, which is present, and others have the same score. So the answer should be 11,16,8,5. But wait, the output format says for a list of IDs, provide a comma-separated list. So the answer would be ""11, 16, 8, 5"". But wait, let me check each of their 'Background (history)' scores again.

Respondent 11: 3
Respondent 16:3
Respondent 8:3
Respondent 5:3

Yes, all four. So the answer is those four. But wait, the example's answer was ""None"" because the respondent 19 wasn't in the data, but in this case, 16 is present and others have the same score. So the correct answer is 11,16,8,5.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents who scored the same on 'Background (history)' as respondent '23'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The goal is to find all respondents who scored the same on 'Background (history)' as respondent '23'. 

First, I need to locate respondent '23' in the responses. Looking through the list, I see that respondent 23 has their answers listed. Under 'Background (history)', their score is 2.

Now, I need to check each other respondent's 'Background (history)' score to see if it matches 2. Let's go through each one:

- Respondent 20: Background (history) is 2. That's a match.
- Respondent 5: Score is 3. Doesn't match.
- Respondent 13: Score is 2. Match.
- Respondent 22: Score is 3. No.
- Respondent 6: Score is 3. No.
- Respondent 18: Score is 2. Match.
- Respondent 17: Score is 3. No.
- Respondent 12: Score is 3. No.
- Respondent 8: Score is 3. No.

So the respondents with a score of 2 in 'Background (history)' are 20, 13, and 18. But wait, the original respondent 23 is excluded? Wait, the task says ""all respondents who scored the same as respondent '23'"", which includes 23? Wait, no, the task says ""excluding the respondent themselves""? Wait, no, the example in the first part had to exclude respondent 19, but in this task, the instruction is just to list those who scored the same as 23. Wait, the task here is: ""List all respondents who scored the same on 'Background (history)' as respondent '23'."" So we include 23 only if others have the same score. Wait, but the example in the first part excluded the respondent themselves. Let me check the task again. The current task doesn't mention excluding the respondent themselves. The example given in the first part was about sessions on the same date as 19, excluding themselves. But here, the task is different. The user's current task is to list all respondents with the same score as 23 on 'Background (history)'. The example in the first part had an answer of ""None"" because maybe there were no others. But in this case, we need to check if 23's score is 2, and find others with 2, including or excluding 23? The task doesn't say to exclude 23, so I should include all, including 23. Wait, but looking at the data, respondent 23's 'Background (history)' is 2. Let me check the responses again.

Looking at the responses:

Respondent 23's answers: ""Background (history)"": 2.

Other respondents:

- 20: 2
- 13: 2
- 18: 2

So the matching respondents are 20, 13, 18, and 23. Wait, but the task says ""all respondents who scored the same as respondent '23'"". So that includes 23? Or is there a need to exclude 23? The task doesn't specify excluding the respondent themselves. The example in the first part did exclude, but that was a different question. So unless the task here says to exclude, we should include. But let me check the task again: ""List all respondents who scored the same on 'Background (history)' as respondent '23'."" So that includes 23. But looking at the data, respondent 23 is part of the responses. So the answer would be 20, 23, 13, 18. Wait, but in the data provided, the respondents are 20,5,23,13,22,6,18,17,12,8. Let me check each:

Respondent 20: 2 → match
Respondent 5: 3 → no
Respondent 23: 2 → yes
Respondent 13: 2 → yes
Respondent 22:3 → no
Respondent 6:3 → no
Respondent 18:2 → yes
Respondent 17:3 → no
Respondent 12:3 → no
Respondent 8:3 → no

So the respondents with score 2 are 20,23,13,18. But the task is to list all respondents who scored the same as 23. Since 23 is part of the data, should they be included? The task doesn't say to exclude them. So the answer would be 20,23,13,18. But wait, in the example given, the answer was ""None"" when looking for same date as 19, which probably meant that there were no others. But in this case, there are others. However, the user might have intended to exclude the respondent themselves. Wait, the example's task was ""Find all respondents who had a session on the same date as respondent '19', excluding the respondent themselves."" So in that case, they excluded. But the current task doesn't mention excluding. So perhaps the answer should include 23. But let me check the data again. Wait, in the provided data, is there a respondent 19? No. The example's data might have had a respondent 19, but in the current dataset, the respondents are 20,5,23,13,22,6,18,17,12,8. So 23 is present here. So the answer would be 20,23,13,18. But the user's example answer was ""None"" because maybe in that case, no one else had the same date. But in this case, there are multiple. However, the task here is different. So the answer should be 20,23,13,18. But wait, looking back at the data:

Wait, respondent 23's 'Background (history)' is 2. So the respondents with 2 are:

- 20: 2
- 13: 2
- 18: 2
- 23: 2

So four respondents. But the task says ""list all respondents"", so including 23. Unless the task implies to exclude 23. But the task doesn't state that. So the answer is 20,23,13,18. But let me check the data again to confirm.

Yes, all four have 2. So the answer should be 20, 23, 13, 18. But wait, looking at the data again:

Respondent 20: Background (history) is 2.

Respondent 23: 2.

Respondent 13: 2.

Respondent 18: 2.

Yes. So the answer is 20,23,13,18. But the example in the first part had an answer of ""None"", but that's a different scenario. So unless there's a mistake in the data, that's the correct answer.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents who scored the same on 'Situation' as respondent '15'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The goal is to find all respondents who scored the same on the 'Situation' question as respondent '15'. 

First, I need to locate respondent '15' in the responses. Let me look through the list. Here's the response for respondent '15':

{
  ""respondent"": ""15"",
  ""answers"": {
    ...
    ""Situation"": 3,
    ...
  }
}

So, their 'Situation' score is 3. Now, I need to check all other respondents to see who else has a 'Situation' score of 3.

Looking at the other responses:

- Respondent '14' has ""Situation"": 3.
- Respondent '12' has ""Situation"": 3.
- Respondent '22' has ""Situation"": 3.
- Respondent '8' has ""Situation"": 3.

Wait, all of them have a 'Situation' score of 3. But the task is to list all respondents who scored the same as '15', excluding '15' themselves. So, the answer should include respondents '14', '12', '22', and '8'. Let me double-check each one to make sure I didn't miss any.

Yes, all except '15' have 'Situation' as 3. So the list is 14, 12, 22, 8. Let me present that as a comma-separated list.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents who scored the same on 'Background (examination)' as respondent '22'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The goal is to find all respondents who scored the same on 'Background (examination)' as respondent '22'. First, I need to find out what score respondent 22 received for that category.

Looking at the responses, I'll search for the entry where the respondent is ""22"". Scanning through the list, here's the entry for respondent 22:

{
  ""respondent"": ""22"",
  ""answers"": {
    ""Date"": ""2025-05-16"",
    ""SessionName"": ""IV (VT)"",
    ""Identification"": 3,
    ""Situation"": 3,
    ""Background (history)"": 3,
    ""Background (examination)"": 3,
    ""Assessment"": 2,
    ""Recommendation (clear recommendation)"": 2,
    ""Recommendation (global rating scale)"": 3,
    ""Comments"": ""Clear communication skills\nGood""
  }
}

So, the 'Background (examination)' score for respondent 22 is 3. Now, I need to find all other respondents who also have a score of 3 in that category, excluding respondent 22 themselves.

Next, I'll go through each response and check their 'Background (examination)' value. Let's list them out:

- Respondent 15: Background (examination) = 3
- Respondent 10: 2
- Respondent 13: 1
- Respondent 17: 3
- Respondent 20: -1 (Hmm, that's an unusual value. The rubric for 'Background (examination)' is 0-3. Maybe it's a typo, but according to the data, it's -1. So it's not 3.)
- Respondent 14: 2
- Respondent 6: 3
- Respondent 7: 3
- Respondent 21: 1
- Respondent 3: 3
- Respondent 5: 3

So the respondents with a score of 3 in 'Background (examination)' are 15, 17, 6, 7, 3, 5, and 22. But we need to exclude respondent 22 as per the task. Therefore, the final list is 15, 17, 6, 7, 3, 5.

Wait, let me double-check each one to make sure I didn't miss any:

- 15: 3 ✅
- 17: 3 ✅
- 6: 3 ✅
- 7: 3 ✅
- 3: 3 ✅
- 5: 3 ✅

Yes, those are all the ones with 3. So the answer should be these respondents, listed as a comma-separated string.

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondents participated in the same session name as respondent '23'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find which respondents participated in the same session name as respondent '23'. First, I need to figure out what session name respondent '23' has.

Looking at the responses, I'll search for the entry where the respondent is '23'. Here it is:

Respondent 23:
- SessionName: ""II-Anaphylaxsis""

Wait, the session name here is ""II-Anaphylaxsis"". Now, I need to check if there are any typos or variations in the session names across other respondents. Let's look at the other responses.

Looking at the other respondents:

Respondent 12:
- SessionName: ""II (Anaphylaxis)""

Respondent 1:
- SessionName: ""V (Hypoglycemia)""

Others have session names like ""III-Sepsis"", ""III (Sepsis)"", etc. 

So, respondent 23's session is ""II-Anaphylaxsis"". The key part here is ""Anaphylaxsis"", which might be a typo for ""Anaphylaxis"". Let's check if other respondents have similar session names. 

Respondent 12's session is ""II (Anaphylaxis)"". The roman numeral ""II"" matches, and ""Anaphylaxis"" is the correct term. It's possible that ""Anaphylaxsis"" in respondent 23's data is a typo. Assuming that ""Anaphylaxsis"" and ""Anaphylaxis"" refer to the same session, then respondent 12 would be a match. However, I need to be cautious here. The problem might consider exact string matches only. 

Looking at the data, the session names are:

- ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" (respondent 23)
- ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" (respondent 12)
- ""V (Hypoglycemia)"" (respondent 1)
- Others are related to Sepsis or Hypoglycemia but different numerals.

If we consider exact string matching, ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" and ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" are different. However, the core session name part (Anaphylaxis vs. Anaphylaxsis) is slightly different. But ""Anaphylaxsis"" might be a misspelling. However, in data analysis, unless specified, we should consider exact matches. 

Wait, but the example given in the problem shows that sometimes session names might have variations. For instance, in the example, the user was looking for respondents with the same date as '19', but the answer was 'None' because maybe there were no others. But in this case, the task is about session names. 

Wait, looking back at the example, the answer was 'None' because perhaps respondent 19 wasn't in the data, but in the current task, we have respondent 23. Let's check again.

In the current data provided, the responses include respondent 23 with session ""II-Anaphylaxsis"". Then, respondent 12 has ""II (Anaphylaxis)"". Are these considered the same session name? The problem might treat them as the same if the core name is the same, but the formatting differs. Alternatively, it might require exact matches. 

But according to the data, session names are entered as open-ended, so variations in formatting (like hyphens vs. parentheses, or spelling errors) might mean they are considered different. For example, in the example data, respondent 14 has ""IV-Hypoglycemia"" and respondent 1 has ""V (Hypoglycemia)"", which are different session names. 

So, in this case, ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" and ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" would be considered different session names because the spelling of ""Anaphylaxsis"" vs. ""Anaphylaxis"" is different. However, ""Anaphylaxsis"" is likely a typo for ""Anaphylaxis"". But without explicit instruction to normalize such typos, we should treat them as different. 

Wait, looking at respondent 23's comments: ""DID: Sepsis I Anaphylaxsis given by team"". This might indicate that the session was intended to be Anaphylaxis but was misspelled. However, the task is to go by the exact session name as recorded. 

Therefore, the only respondent with the exact session name ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" is respondent 23. But the question asks for other respondents who participated in the same session name as respondent 23, excluding themselves. So, if no one else has ""II-Anaphylaxsis"", the answer would be none. 

But wait, respondent 12 has ""II (Anaphylaxis)"". If we consider that ""Anaphylaxis"" is the correct term and ""Anaphylaxsis"" is a typo, but the data doesn't indicate that, then they are different. Therefore, the answer would be that no other respondents share the exact session name as respondent 23. 

Alternatively, if the session name is considered the same despite formatting differences (like ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" vs. ""II (Anaphylaxis)""), then respondent 12 would be a match. But given that the example in the problem shows that the answer was 'None' when looking for same date as '19' (which might not exist in the data), perhaps the correct approach here is to look for exact matches. 

Therefore, the answer is that no other respondents have the same session name as respondent 23. But wait, let's check again. 

Wait, respondent 23's session name is ""II-Anaphylaxsis"". Are there any other respondents with that exact string? Looking through the list:

- Respondent 12: ""II (Anaphylaxis)""
- Respondent 1: ""V (Hypoglycemia)""
- Others: Sepsis-related.

No, no one else has ""II-Anaphylaxsis"". Therefore, the answer is none. But wait, the example had the answer as 'None' when the date was the same as respondent 19, which wasn't present. Here, respondent 23's session name is unique. So the answer should be none. But wait, let me check again.

Wait, in the responses, respondent 23's SessionName is ""II-Anaphylaxsis"". Respondent 12's is ""II (Anaphylaxis)"". The roman numeral is the same (II), but the session name part is different. So unless the system considers Anaphylaxsis and Anaphylaxis as the same, which they are not, then there are no matches. Therefore, the answer is none. But wait, Anaphylaxsis is a misspelling of Anaphylaxis. But in data processing, unless specified, we don't correct typos. So the answer is no other respondents. Hence, the answer is None.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents who scored the same on 'Situation' as respondent '4'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to list all respondents who scored the same on 'Situation' as respondent '4'. 

First, I need to find out what score respondent '4' received for the 'Situation' question. Looking at the responses data, I'll search for the entry where the respondent is ""4"". 

Here's the entry for respondent '4':
{
  ""respondent"": ""4"",
  ""answers"": {
    ""Date"": ""2025-05-16"",
    ""SessionName"": ""III (Sepsis)"",
    ""Identification"": 3,
    ""Situation"": 3,
    ...
  }
}
So, the 'Situation' score for respondent '4' is 3.

Next, I need to go through all other respondents and check their 'Situation' scores. The goal is to find those who also have a score of 3, excluding respondent '4' themselves.

Let's list out all respondents and their 'Situation' scores:

- Respondent 23: 3
- Respondent 5: 3
- Respondent 16: 3
- Respondent 15: 3
- Respondent 1: 2
- Respondent 3: 2
- Respondent 19: 3
- Respondent 9: 3
- Respondent 4: 3 (exclude this one)
- Respondent 14: 3
- Respondent 18: 3
- Respondent 21: 2

Now, compiling the list of respondents with 'Situation' score 3, excluding '4':
23, 5, 16, 15, 19, 9, 14, 18.

Wait, let me double-check each one to make sure I didn't miss any:

- 23: 3 ✅
- 5: 3 ✅
- 16: 3 ✅
- 15: 3 ✅
- 19: 3 ✅
- 9: 3 ✅
- 14: 3 ✅
- 18: 3 ✅

Yes, that's all. The respondents with 'Situation' score 3, excluding respondent 4, are 23, 5, 16, 15, 19, 9, 14, and 18.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents who scored the same on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' as respondent '12' and also scored perfectly on 'Background (examination)'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find all respondents who scored the same as respondent '12' on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and also scored perfectly on 'Background (examination)'. 

First, I need to find out what respondent '12' scored on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)'. Looking at the responses, respondent '12' has the answers section. Let me check their 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' score. Oh, here it is: 3. So we're looking for other respondents with a score of 3 in that category.

Next, the other condition is a perfect score on 'Background (examination)'. The rubric for 'Background (examination)' says a 3 is ""Comprehensive focused examination/observations"". So we need respondents who have a 3 in that field.

Now, I'll go through each respondent in the responses and check both conditions. Let's list them out:

- Respondent 3: 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' is 3, 'Background (examination)' is 3. So that's a match.
- Respondent 4: Recommendation is 2, Background exam is 2. Doesn't meet either.
- Respondent 16: Recommendation is 2, Background exam is 3. So Background is good, but Recommendation is 2, not matching '12's 3.
- Respondent 20: Recommendation is 2, Background exam is -1. Nope.
- Respondent 18: Both scores are 2. No.
- Respondent 1: Recommendation is 2, Background exam 2. No.
- Respondent 17: Recommendation is 3, Background exam is 3. That's a match.
- Respondent 8: Recommendation is 2, Background exam 2. No.
- Respondent 12: The target, but we exclude them as per the example (though the task doesn't say to exclude, but the example did. Wait, the task here says ""all respondents"" including 12? Wait, the task says ""list all respondents who..."", so if 12 meets their own criteria, they should be included. Wait, the example was excluding respondent 19, but in this task, there's no mention of excluding. So need to check if 12 themselves should be included. Let me check the task again. The task says ""all respondents who scored the same... as respondent '12'"", so that includes 12 if they meet the other condition. Let's check: 12's 'Background (examination)' is 3. So yes, 12 would be included. But wait, in the data, respondent 12's 'Background (examination)' is 3. So they have both the same recommendation score as themselves (which is 3) and a perfect background exam. So they should be included. But let me check the data again. 

Looking at respondent 12's data: ""Background (examination)"": 3. Yes. So they meet both conditions. So 12 is a candidate. But the example had a similar task where the answer was ""None"", but that's a different case. Here, we need to include all, including 12 if applicable.

Continuing:

- Respondent 23: Recommendation is 3, Background exam is 2. So no.
- Respondent 5: Recommendation is 2, Background exam 3. So no.
- Respondent 7: Recommendation is 2, Background exam 3. No.

So the respondents that meet both conditions are:

- Respondent 3: Both 3s.
- Respondent 12: Both 3s.
- Respondent 17: Both 3s.

Wait, wait. Let me check again. Respondent 17's 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' is 3, and 'Background (examination)' is 3. Yes. So that's a match. Respondent 3: same. Respondent 12: same. So the answer should be 3,12,17. But wait, let me check the data again to confirm.

Looking at each:

Respondent 3:
""Recommendation (clear recommendation)"": 3
""Background (examination)"": 3 → yes.

Respondent 12:
""Recommendation (clear recommendation)"": 3
""Background (examination)"": 3 → yes.

Respondent 17:
""Recommendation (clear recommendation)"": 3
""Background (examination)"": 3 → yes.

So all three meet the criteria. Therefore, the answer should be ""3, 12, 17"".

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Find all respondents who participated in the same session name as respondent '12' and whose comments contain the word 'Good'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The goal is to find all respondents who participated in the same session name as respondent '12' and whose comments include the word 'Good'. 

First, I need to determine what session name respondent '12' has. Looking at the responses, I'll search for the entry where the respondent is ""12"". 

Found respondent '12' in the list. Their answers show the SessionName is ""II (Anaphylaxis)"". So, the target session name is ""II (Anaphylaxis)"". 

Next, I need to find all other respondents who have the same SessionName. But wait, the session names might have variations. For example, some entries might have hyphens or different spacing. Let me check all SessionNames in the responses to ensure I capture all possible matches.

Looking through the responses:
- Respondent 1: ""V (Hypoglycemia)""
- Respondent 12: ""II (Anaphylaxis)""
- Respondent 3: ""III-Sepsis""
- Respondent 22: ""IV (VT)""
- Respondent 8: ""III (Sepsis)""
- Respondent 4: ""III (Sepsis)""
- Respondent 11: ""IV (AF)""
- Respondent 5: ""II - Anaphylaxsis""
- Respondent 23: ""II-Anaphylaxsis""
- Respondent 6: ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)""

Hmm, the session names for Anaphylaxis-related entries have different variations. Respondent 12's session is ""II (Anaphylaxis)"", but others have ""II - Anaphylaxsis"", ""II-Anaphylaxsis"", and ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"". Are these considered the same session? The task says ""same session name"", so I need to match exactly. However, the variations might be typos or different formatting. For example, ""Anaphylaxsis"" could be a misspelling of ""Anaphylaxis"". But according to the data provided, the exact session names are as written. 

Wait, the task specifies ""same session name"", so I should look for exact matches. Respondent 12's session is ""II (Anaphylaxis)"". Let's check if any other respondents have that exact name. 

Looking again:
- Respondent 5: ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" (different spelling and punctuation)
- Respondent 23: ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" (different spelling and hyphen)
- Respondent 6: ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"" (different name)
- Respondent 12: ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" (target)
- Any others? No. So, no exact matches except respondent 12 themselves. 

But wait, maybe the session name is considered the same if the main part is the same, like ""II"" regardless of the rest? The question says ""same session name"", so it's about the exact string. Therefore, only respondent 12 has ""II (Anaphylaxis)"". 

But let me double-check. The task might consider variations as the same session. For example, ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" and ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" could be intended as the same session but with typos. However, based on the data provided, we have to take the session names as they are. So, unless there's a clear indication that these are the same session (like a note in the data), we can't assume they are the same. 

Therefore, the only respondent with the exact session name ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" is respondent 12. But the task asks for others who participated in the same session, excluding themselves. So, if there are no exact matches, the answer would be none. However, let's check the comments for the word 'Good' in case there's a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the session names again. Respondent 5's session is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"", which is similar but not the same. Respondent 23's is ""II-Anaphylaxsis"". Respondent 6's is ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"". None of these exactly match ""II (Anaphylaxis)"". So, no other respondents have the exact same session name as respondent 12. 

But the task also requires that their comments contain the word 'Good'. Let's check the comments of respondent 12: ""Good"". So, even if there were others with the same session name, their comments need to include 'Good'. 

Since there are no other respondents with the exact session name as 12, the answer would be none. However, let's check if any respondents with similar session names have 'Good' in their comments. For example, respondent 5's session is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" and their comment is ""Good clear and precise clinical handover\nGood"". That includes 'Good'. Similarly, respondent 8's comment has 'Good', but their session is ""III (Sepsis)"". 

But since the session names don't exactly match, they wouldn't be included. Therefore, the answer is none. But wait, the example given in the problem had an answer of ""None"" when there were no matches. So, in this case, the answer would be None as well. 

Wait, but let me confirm again. The task is to find respondents who participated in the same session name as respondent '12' (which is ""II (Anaphylaxis)"") and have 'Good' in comments. Since no other respondents have that exact session name, the answer is none. However, perhaps the session name variations are considered the same. For example, ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" vs ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" might be considered the same session but different formatting. If that's the case, then respondents 5 and 23 might be included. But according to the data, the session names are different. The task says ""same session name"", so exact match is required. Therefore, the answer is none.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' is higher than the average 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' for all sessions that happened on the same date as respondent '16's session.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find all respondents whose 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' score is higher than the average of that same score for all sessions that occurred on the same date as respondent '16's session. 

First, I need to determine the date of respondent '16's session. Looking through the responses, I find that respondent '16' has a date of ""2025-05-02"". 

Next, I need to identify all other respondents who had sessions on the same date, which is 2025-05-02. From the data, the respondents with that date are:
- Respondent '8' (2025-05-02)
- Respondent '1' (2025-05-02)
- Respondent '16' (2025-05-02) [but we'll exclude this one when calculating the average since we need others on the same date]

Now, I need to calculate the average 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' score for these sessions. Let's list their scores:
- Respondent '8': 2
- Respondent '1': 2
- Respondent '16': 2 (but we exclude this one as per the problem statement)

So, the average of the other two respondents (8 and 1) is (2 + 2) / 2 = 2. 

The next step is to find all respondents (across all dates) whose 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' score is higher than this average of 2. 

Looking through all respondents:
- Respondent '21': 3 (higher than 2)
- Respondent '9': 3 (higher than 2)
- Respondent '8': 2 (equal, not higher)
- Respondent '4': 2 (equal)
- Respondent '1': 2 (equal)
- Respondent '6': 2 (equal)
- Respondent '16': 2 (equal)
- Respondent '13': 2 (equal)
- Respondent '15': 2 (equal)
- Respondent '22': 2 (equal)

Only respondents '21' and '9' have a score of 3, which is higher than the average of 2. 

Therefore, the answer should be the respondents '21' and '9'.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>
