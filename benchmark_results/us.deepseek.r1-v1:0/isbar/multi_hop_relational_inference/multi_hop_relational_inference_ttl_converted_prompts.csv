</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondents participated in the same session name as respondent '9'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find which respondents participated in the same session name as respondent '9'. First, I need to figure out what session name respondent 9 has.

Looking at the data for :Respondent9, the pred:SessionName is ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"". Wait, I notice that the spelling here is ""Anaphylaxsis"" with an extra 's' compared to another entry. Let me check other respondents to see if there are similar session names. For example, :Respondent12 has ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" which is spelled with one 's'. Hmm, could this be a typo? The question is about the session name, so I need to consider exact matches. But maybe in the data, they are considered the same despite the typo. Wait, but the problem says ""same session name"", so it's possible that the exact string has to match. Let me confirm.

Looking at the responses, :Respondent5 has ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" (with the extra 's' and a hyphen), and :Respondent9 has ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"". So the session names are slightly different in punctuation and spelling. But the task is to find the same session name. So unless the names are exactly the same, they wouldn't count. Wait, but maybe the hyphen vs parentheses are considered part of the name. So ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" and ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"" are different. Similarly, ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" is another variation. So perhaps these are considered different session names. 

Wait, but the question is about the same session name as respondent 9. Respondent9's session name is ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"". Let's check all other respondents:

- Respondent12: ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" – different spelling (Anaphylaxis vs Anaphylaxsis)
- Respondent5: ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" – same spelling as 9 but different punctuation (hyphen vs parentheses)
- Respondent9: ""II (Anaphylaxsis)""
- Others have different session names like ""III (Sepsis)"", ""IV (VT)"", etc.

So, the exact session name for respondent9 is ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"". Now, looking for other respondents with the same exact session name. Respondent5's session name is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"". The difference is the hyphen instead of parentheses. So unless the system considers these as the same, but according to the data, they are different strings. Therefore, only respondent9 has that exact session name. Wait, but maybe the hyphen and parentheses are considered part of the name, so they are different. Therefore, there might be no other respondents with the exact same session name. But wait, let me check again.

Wait, :Respondent5's SessionName is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" and :Respondent9's is ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"". The main part after II is ""Anaphylaxsis"" in both, but the separators are different. So the full session names are different. Therefore, no other respondents share the exact session name as respondent9. So the answer would be none. But wait, maybe the system treats ""Anaphylaxsis"" and ""Anaphylaxis"" as the same, but the names are different. So in that case, no matches except respondent9. But the question says to exclude the respondent themselves. Wait, the original example had a similar question, but here the task is different. The current task is to find respondents with the same session name as respondent9, excluding respondent9. So if no one else has the exact session name, the answer is none. But let me check again.

Wait, looking at the data again:

Respondent5: pred:SessionName ""II - Anaphylaxsis""

Respondent9: pred:SessionName ""II (Anaphylaxsis)""

These are different strings. The session names are not exactly the same. Therefore, no other respondents have the same session name as respondent9. Hence, the answer is none.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondents participated in the same session name as respondent '9'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find which respondents participated in the same session name as respondent '9'. First, I need to figure out what session name respondent 9 has.

Looking at the responses section, I'll search for :Respondent9. Here's the entry for them:

:Respondent9 a :Person ;
    pred:Date ""2025-05-04"" ;
    pred:SessionName ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"" ;
    ... (other properties) ...

So, the session name for respondent 9 is ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"". Now, I need to find all other respondents who have the same session name. But wait, I should check if there are variations in the session names that might be considered the same. For example, maybe different punctuation or spacing. Let's look through all the respondents.

Looking at the other respondents:

- Respondent5 has pred:SessionName ""II - Anaphylaxsis""
- Respondent15: ""III - Sepsis""
- Respondent3: ""III-Sepsis""
- Respondent16: ""I - MI""
- Respondent22: ""IV (VT)""
- Respondent10: ""(MI)-VT""
- Respondent2: ""MI""
- Respondent6: ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)""
- Respondent17: ""V (Hypoglycemia)""

So, comparing to respondent9's ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"", let's see if any others match exactly or similarly. Respondent5's session name is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"". The difference here is the hyphen with spaces vs. parentheses. But the task is to find the same session name. The exact strings are ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"" vs. ""II - Anaphylaxsis"". These are different strings, so they might not be considered the same. However, maybe there's a typo or variation. Wait, ""Anaphylaxsis"" might be a misspelling of ""Anaphylaxis"". But according to the data provided, the session names are as given. So we have to take them literally.

Wait, respondent9's session name is ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"", and respondent5's is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"". The only difference is the punctuation between II and Anaphylaxsis. But the problem says ""same session name"", so unless the names are considered the same despite the punctuation, they are different. However, looking at the data, perhaps ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" and ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"" are considered the same session. But according to the data, they are different strings. For example, respondent5 and respondent9 have different session names. Wait, but maybe the session name is considered the same if the main part is the same, but the formatting differs. But the problem states ""same session name"", so it's exact match required.

Wait, let me check again. The task is to find respondents with the same session name as respondent9. So the exact string match. Respondent9's session name is ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"". Let's check all other respondents:

- Respondent5: ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" (different punctuation)
- Respondent9: ""II (Anaphylaxsis)""
- Any others? Let's check all:

Looking again:

Respondent5: ""II - Anaphylaxsis""
Respondent9: ""II (Anaphylaxsis)""
Respondent6: ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)""
Others are different.

So, the exact session name ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"" is only for respondent9. Respondent5's session name is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"", which is similar but not the same. Therefore, there are no other respondents with the exact same session name as respondent9. Therefore, the answer would be none.

But wait, maybe the hyphen vs. parentheses is a typo, and they are intended to be the same session. But according to the data as given, they are different. The problem says ""same session name"", so we have to go by the exact string. Therefore, the answer is that no other respondents share the exact session name as respondent9.

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents who scored the same on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' as respondent '15'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The question is asking to list all respondents who scored the same on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' as respondent '15'. 

First, I need to find out what score respondent 15 has for the 'Recommendation_clear_recommendation' predicate. Looking at the responses section, I'll search for :Respondent15. 

Here's the entry for Respondent15:
:Respondent15 a :Person ;
    pred:Date ""2025-05-04"" ;
    pred:SessionName ""III - Sepsis"" ;
    pred:Identification ""3"" ;
    pred:Situation ""3"" ;
    pred:Background_history ""2"" ;
    pred:Background_examination ""3"" ;
    pred:Assessment ""2"" ;
    pred:Recommendation_clear_recommendation ""2"" ;
    pred:Recommendation_global_rating_scale ""2"" ;
    pred:Comments ""Detailed Response - clear communication"" .

So, the 'Recommendation_clear_recommendation' score for Respondent15 is ""2"".

Next, I need to check all other respondents to see who else has a ""2"" in their 'Recommendation_clear_recommendation' field. Let's go through each respondent one by one.

- **Respondent3**: pred:Recommendation_clear_recommendation ""3"" → Doesn't match.
- **Respondent21**: pred:Recommendation_clear_recommendation ""3"" → Doesn't match.
- **Respondent23**: pred:Recommendation_clear_recommendation ""3"" → Doesn't match.
- **Respondent20**: pred:Recommendation_clear_recommendation ""2"" → Matches.
- **Respondent17**: pred:Recommendation_clear_recommendation ""3"" → Doesn't match.
- **Respondent13**: pred:Recommendation_clear_recommendation ""2"" → Matches.
- **Respondent2**: pred:Recommendation_clear_recommendation ""2"" → Matches.
- **Respondent8**: pred:Recommendation_clear_recommendation ""2"" → Matches.

Wait, let me double-check each entry to ensure accuracy.

- **Respondent20**: Yes, ""2"".
- **Respondent13**: Yes, ""2"".
- **Respondent2**: Yes, ""2"".
- **Respondent8**: Yes, ""2"".

So, the respondents with the same score as Respondent15 (which is 2) are 20, 13, 2, and 8. 

But wait, the task says ""list all respondents"", which includes Respondent15? The question says ""as respondent '15'"", so we need to exclude Respondent15 themselves. Let me check the original task again: ""List all respondents who scored the same on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' as respondent '15'."" So, we should include all except Respondent15. 

Looking at the list, the matching respondents are 20, 13, 2, 8. 

Let me confirm each of their scores again to be sure:

- **Respondent20**: ""2"" → Correct.
- **Respondent13**: ""2"" → Correct.
- **Respondent2**: ""2"" → Correct.
- **Respondent8**: ""2"" → Correct.

So the final list should be these four, excluding Respondent15. Therefore, the answer is Respondents 20, 13, 2, and 8. The output should be a comma-separated list of their numbers: 20, 13, 2, 8.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondents participated in the same session name as respondent '2'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find which respondents participated in the same session name as respondent '2'. First, I need to figure out what session name respondent '2' has.

Looking at the data for :Respondent2, the pred:SessionName is ""MI"". So, the session name we're looking for is ""MI"". Now, I need to check all other respondents to see if any of them have the same session name, excluding respondent '2' themselves.

Let's go through each respondent one by one:

- :Respondent23: SessionName is ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" – not a match.
- :Respondent3: ""III-Sepsis"" – nope.
- :Respondent17: ""V (Hypoglycemia)"" – no.
- :Respondent6: ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"" – different.
- :Respondent2: That's the one we're excluding.
- :Respondent8: ""III (Sepsis)"" – not MI.
- :Respondent15: ""III - Sepsis"" – still no.
- :Respondent21: ""I (Myocardial infarction)"" – Hmm, ""Myocardial infarction"" is often abbreviated as MI. But the session name here is written out as ""I (Myocardial infarction)"", so the actual name is ""Myocardial infarction"", not just ""MI"". Wait, but respondent '2' has ""MI"" as the session name. Are these considered the same? The session names might be case-sensitive or exact matches. The question is about the same session name as respondent '2', which is ""MI"". So unless another respondent has ""MI"" exactly, they don't count. Let's check others.

- :Respondent9: ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"" – no.
- :Respondent16: ""I - MI"" – Here, the session name is ""I - MI"". The ""MI"" part matches, but the full name is ""I - MI"". Is this considered the same as ""MI""? The original respondent '2' has ""MI"" as the session name. The question is about the same session name. If the session name is exactly ""MI"", then ""I - MI"" might not be the same. But maybe the ""MI"" in the name is the key part. However, according to the data, session names are exact strings. So ""MI"" and ""I - MI"" are different. Therefore, only respondent '2' has ""MI"" as the session name. Wait, but respondent '16' has ""I - MI"" which includes ""MI"". But the task is to find the same session name. Unless ""MI"" is an abbreviation that's considered equivalent, but based on the data provided, we have to take the session names as exact strings. Therefore, only respondent '2' has ""MI"", and others with ""MI"" in their session name but not exactly ""MI"" would not count. 

Wait, but let me check again. The session name for respondent '16' is ""I - MI"". The session name for respondent '2' is ""MI"". Are these considered the same? The problem states ""same session name"", so exact match. Therefore, only respondent '2' has ""MI"". Therefore, there are no other respondents with the exact session name ""MI"". So the answer would be none. But wait, maybe I missed someone. Let me check all again:

- :Respondent2: ""MI""
- :Respondent16: ""I - MI""
- :Respondent21: ""I (Myocardial infarction)"" – which is MI spelled out.

No other respondents have ""MI"" exactly. So the answer is none. But wait, maybe the session name for respondent '16' is ""I - MI"", which includes ""MI"" as part of the name. But the question is about the same session name. If the session name is exactly ""MI"", then only respondent '2' has that. Therefore, no other respondents. So the answer is none.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents who scored the same on 'Background (history)' as respondent '13'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The question is asking to list all respondents who scored the same on 'Background (history)' as respondent '13'. 

First, I need to find out what score respondent 13 has for the 'Background_history' field. Looking at the responses section, I see that :Respondent13 has pred:Background_history ""2"". So their score is 2.

Next, I need to go through all other respondents and check their 'Background_history' scores to see which ones also have a score of 2. Let's list them out:

- :Respondent23 has pred:Background_history ""2""
- :Respondent10 has pred:Background_history ""2""
- :Respondent14 has pred:Background_history ""2""
- :Respondent2 has pred:Background_history ""2""

Wait, let me double-check each one to make sure I don't miss any or include incorrect ones. 

Looking at each respondent:

- Respondent12: Background_history is ""3"" – not a match.
- Respondent23: ""2"" – match.
- Respondent10: ""2"" – match.
- Respondent13: ""2"" (but we exclude them as per the task, which says ""excluding the respondent themselves"" if needed, but the task here is to find others with the same score, so including others with 2. Wait, the task here is just same score, not same date. The previous example was about same date, but this task is different. So no need to exclude respondent13 unless the task says so. Wait, the task says ""list all respondents who scored the same... as respondent '13'"". So including respondent13? Wait, the example in the problem had to exclude the respondent themselves, but in this task, the user hasn't specified to exclude respondent13. Wait, the task says ""list all respondents"", so unless instructed otherwise, we include all, including 13. Wait, but the example had to exclude, but this task doesn't mention excluding. Let me check the task again.

The task is: ""List all respondents who scored the same on 'Background (history)' as respondent '13'."" So it's possible that respondent13 is included unless the task says to exclude. But in the example, the user had to exclude the respondent themselves, but here, the task doesn't specify that. However, sometimes in such questions, it's implied to exclude the original respondent, but the user's instruction here isn't clear. Wait, the example's answer was ""None"" because maybe there were no others on the same date as 19. But in this case, the task is different. Let me check the data again.

Wait, looking at the data:

Respondent13's Background_history is 2. Now, checking others:

- Respondent23: 2
- Respondent10: 2
- Respondent14: 2
- Respondent2: 2

So those four (23,10,14,2) plus 13. But the task says ""list all respondents"" who have the same score as 13, which includes 13 themselves. But maybe the user wants to exclude 13? The example in the problem excluded the respondent themselves, but that was for a different question (same date). The current task doesn't specify exclusion. However, in many cases, when asking for others with the same value, it's common to exclude the original. But the user's instruction here is ambiguous. Let me check the task again.

The task is: ""List all respondents who scored the same on 'Background (history)' as respondent '13'."" The wording doesn't say to exclude respondent13. So according to strict reading, we should include all, including 13. But in the example given, the answer was ""None"" when looking for same date as 19, which might imply that in that case, there were no others. But in this case, there are others. However, the example's data might not have had any other respondents on the same date as 19. Let me check the example data again.

In the example data, the answer was ""None"" for respondents with the same date as 19. Looking at the example data, there's no respondent19 listed. The example's data includes respondents 12,23,10,13,14,11,2. So if the question was about respondent19, which isn't present, the answer is none. But in the current task, respondent13 exists. So back to the current task: the answer should include all respondents with Background_history 2, including 13. But perhaps the user expects to exclude 13? Let me check the task again. The task says ""list all respondents who scored the same... as respondent '13'"". So if respondent13 is part of that list, then they should be included. However, in some contexts, when you ask ""who else"", but the wording here is ""all respondents"", so including 13. But maybe the user wants to exclude 13. Hmm. Let me check the data again.

Looking at the data:

Respondent13: Background_history ""2""

Others with ""2"":

- Respondent23: 2
- Respondent10: 2
- Respondent14: 2
- Respondent2: 2

So total of 5 respondents including 13. But the task is to list all respondents who scored the same as 13. So the answer would be 13,23,10,14,2. But the user might expect to exclude 13. However, the task doesn't specify that. The example in the problem excluded the respondent themselves, but that was a different question. So perhaps in this case, the answer should include all, including 13. But I need to check the user's instructions again.

Wait, the user's output rules say: ""If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"")."" So the answer should be the list of respondents, including their IDs. The respondent IDs are like Respondent12, Respondent23, etc. But the task says ""respondent '13'"", so the ID is Respondent13. So the answer should be the list of all respondents with Background_history 2. Let me check each:

- Respondent23: 2
- Respondent10: 2
- Respondent13: 2
- Respondent14: 2
- Respondent2: 2

So the list is Respondent23, Respondent10, Respondent13, Respondent14, Respondent2. But the user might want the numerical part of the ID, so 23,10,13,14,2. However, the output example in the format shows ""17, 21, 23"" which are numbers. So in the data, the respondents are numbered as 12,23,10,13,14,11,2. So the answer would be 23,10,13,14,2. But wait, the task says ""list all respondents who scored the same as respondent '13'"". So if respondent13 is included, then the list is 23,10,13,14,2. But perhaps the user expects to exclude 13. Let me check the task again. The task does not mention excluding the respondent themselves. The example in the problem did, but that was a different question. So in this case, the answer should include all, including 13. However, in the example, the answer was ""None"" because there were no other respondents on the same date as 19 (which wasn't present). So in this case, the answer would be 23,10,13,14,2. But let me check the data again to confirm.

Yes, all those respondents have Background_history 2. So the answer is 23,10,13,14,2. But wait, the user's output rules say to provide a simple comma-separated list. So the answer should be ""23, 10, 13, 14, 2"". However, looking at the data, Respondent2 is written as :Respondent2, which is ""2"" as the ID. So the list would be 23,10,13,14,2. But the user might expect the numerical order, but the order in the data is not specified. The task just asks to list them, so the order might not matter. So the final answer is 23,10,13,14,2.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents who scored the same on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' as respondent '13'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The question is asking to list all respondents who scored the same on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' as respondent '13'. 

First, I need to find out what score respondent 13 has for that particular question. Looking at the responses section, I'll search for :Respondent13. 

Here's the data for :Respondent13:
- pred:Recommendation_clear_recommendation ""2""

So, respondent 13 has a score of ""2"" for the clear recommendation question. 

Next, I need to check all other respondents to see who else has a score of ""2"" in the same category. Let's go through each respondent one by one.

:Respondent12 has pred:Recommendation_clear_recommendation ""3"" – that's a 3, so no match.
:Respondent10 has ""2"" – that's a match.
:Respondent21 has ""3"" – no match.
:Respondent5 has ""2"" – another match.
:Respondent3 has ""3"" – no match.
:Respondent22 has ""2"" – that's a match as well.

Wait, let me double-check each one to be sure. 

- :Respondent10: ""2"" – yes.
- :Respondent13: ""2"" (but we need to exclude them as per the task? Wait, the task says ""list all respondents who scored the same as respondent '13'"", but it doesn't specify excluding them. Wait, the example in the original problem excluded the respondent themselves, but in this task, the user didn't mention excluding. Wait, the task is: ""List all respondents who scored the same on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' as respondent '13'."" So, does that include respondent 13 or not? The example in the first part excluded respondent 19, but here, the task doesn't say to exclude. Hmm. Wait, the original example was about finding same date, excluding themselves. But this task is different. Let me check the task again.

The task is: ""List all respondents who scored the same on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' as respondent '13'."" The original example excluded the respondent themselves, but this task doesn't specify that. So, should we include respondent 13 in the list? The answer would depend on that. However, looking at the data, respondent 13 is the one with the score, so if the task is to find others with the same score, we need to exclude respondent 13. But the task doesn't explicitly state to exclude. Wait, maybe the task is just to find all respondents with the same score, including themselves. But in the example, they excluded, but that was a different question. Let me check the exact wording again.

The original example's task was: ""Find all respondents who had a session on the same date as respondent '19', excluding the respondent themselves."" So, the exclusion was part of that specific question. The current task is different: it just says ""List all respondents who scored the same... as respondent '13'."" So unless the task says to exclude, we should include respondent 13 if they have the same score. But wait, in this case, respondent 13 is the one we're comparing to. So if we include them, the list would have respondent 13 and others. But maybe the user wants others with the same score, not including 13. But the task doesn't specify. Hmm. Let me check the data again.

Wait, looking at the data, the respondents are 12,10,21,13,5,3,22. So, the respondents in the data are 12,10,21,13,5,3,22. So, respondent 13 is part of the data. The task is to list all respondents (including 13?) who have the same score. But perhaps the user expects to exclude 13. But the example in the original problem had ""excluding the respondent themselves"", but that was a different question. Since the current task doesn't mention excluding, perhaps we should include all, including 13. But let's check the data again.

Wait, in the data provided, the respondents are:

- :Respondent12
- :Respondent10
- :Respondent21
- :Respondent13
- :Respondent5
- :Respondent3
- :Respondent22

So, when the task says ""respondent '13'"", that's :Respondent13. Now, looking at the 'Recommendation_clear_recommendation' for each:

- :Respondent12: 3
- :Respondent10: 2
- :Respondent21: 3
- :Respondent13: 2
- :Respondent5: 2
- :Respondent3: 3
- :Respondent22: 2

So, the score for respondent 13 is 2. The other respondents with 2 are :Respondent10, :Respondent5, and :Respondent22. So, including respondent 13, that's four, but the task says ""list all respondents who scored the same as respondent '13'"". If the task includes respondent 13, then the answer would be 10,13,5,22. But if we need to exclude 13, then 10,5,22. 

But the task doesn't specify to exclude respondent 13. The example in the original problem did exclude, but that was a different question. So, perhaps the user expects to include all, including 13. However, in many cases, when you're asked ""who else"", but the task here is just ""list all respondents who scored the same"", which would include the respondent themselves. But maybe the user expects to exclude. Let me check the original example again. In the example, the answer was ""None"" because after checking the data, there were no other respondents with the same date as 19. But in the current data, perhaps the answer is different.

Wait, the original example's answer was ""None"" because respondent 19 wasn't in the data. Wait, looking back, the example's data included respondents 12,10,21,13,5,3,22. The example's task was to find those with the same date as 19, which isn't present, hence the answer ""None"". 

In the current task, the respondents are the same. So, for the current task, the answer would be the list of respondents with the same score as 13, which is 2. The respondents with 2 are 10,13,5,22. But the task says ""list all respondents"", so including 13. However, in some contexts, when you're asked ""who else"", but the task here is not using ""else"". So, perhaps the answer should include 13. But maybe the user expects to exclude 13. Let me check the task again: ""List all respondents who scored the same on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' as respondent '13'."" So, the task is to find all respondents (including 13) who have the same score. But in the example, the answer excluded the respondent themselves. However, the example's task explicitly said ""excluding the respondent themselves"". Since the current task does not mention excluding, perhaps we should include 13. 

But let's look at the data again. The respondents with score 2 are:

- :Respondent10
- :Respondent13
- :Respondent5
- :Respondent22

So, four respondents. But the answer needs to list their identifiers. The identifiers are in the format :RespondentXX, but the output should be the numbers, like 10,13,5,22. However, the output instructions say: ""If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., '17, 21, 23')"". So, the answer should be the numbers, separated by commas. 

But wait, the actual identifiers in the data are :Respondent10, :Respondent13, etc. So, the numbers are 10,13,5,22. So, the answer would be ""10, 13, 5, 22"". But the user might expect to exclude 13. Let me check again. The task is to list all respondents who scored the same as respondent 13. Since respondent 13 is part of the data, and the task doesn't say to exclude, they should be included. However, in some cases, people might assume that you don't include the person you're comparing to. But the example in the original problem had an explicit exclusion. Since the current task doesn't mention exclusion, perhaps we should include all. 

But let's check the data again. The answer in the example was ""None"" because there was no respondent 19. In the current data, respondent 13 exists. So, the answer would be 10,13,5,22. But let's confirm each of their scores:

- :Respondent10: 2
- :Respondent13: 2
- :Respondent5: 2
- :Respondent22: 2

Yes, all have 2. So, the answer is 10,13,5,22. But the user might have intended to exclude 13. However, the task doesn't state that. Therefore, the correct answer is all four respondents. But wait, looking back at the data, :Respondent5's Recommendation_clear_recommendation is ""2"". Yes. :Respondent22's is ""2"". So, the list is 10,13,5,22. 

But wait, the output instructions say: ""If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., '17, 21, 23')"". So, the answer should be the numbers, separated by commas. So, the answer is ""10, 13, 5, 22"". However, the user might have intended to exclude 13. Let me check the original example again. In the example, the task was to find others on the same date as 19, excluding themselves. The current task doesn't have that exclusion. So, perhaps the answer includes 13. 

But wait, the example's answer was ""None"" because there was no respondent 19. In the current data, respondent 13 exists. So, the answer should include 13. Therefore, the final answer is 10,13,5,22.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents who scored the same on 'Background (history)' as respondent '16'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The question is asking to list all respondents who scored the same on 'Background (history)' as respondent '16'. 

First, I need to understand what 'Background (history)' refers to. Looking at the questions section, there's a predicate called QBackground_history with the text ""Gives appropriate history. [Rubric: 0 = ...]"". So the relevant predicate here is pred:Background_history.

Next, I need to find the score that respondent 16 received for this predicate. Checking the responses for :Respondent16, I see the line pred:Background_history ""3"". So respondent 16 has a score of 3 in Background_history.

Now, I need to go through all other respondents and check their pred:Background_history values. Let's list them out:

- :Respondent7: pred:Background_history ""2""
- :Respondent11: pred:Background_history ""3""
- :Respondent23: pred:Background_history ""2""
- :Respondent8: pred:Background_history ""3""
- :Respondent5: pred:Background_history ""3""
- :Respondent18: pred:Background_history ""2""

So the respondents with a score of 3 in Background_history are Respondent11, Respondent8, Respondent5, and Respondent16. But the task says to exclude respondent 16 themselves, so we remove that. That leaves us with Respondent11, Respondent8, and Respondent5.

Wait, let me double-check each one to make sure I didn't miss any. 

Respondent7: 2. No. Respondent11: 3. Yes. Respondent23: 2. No. Respondent8: 3. Yes. Respondent5: 3. Yes. Respondent18: 2. No. 

So the final list should be 11, 8, 5. But wait, the answer format requires a comma-separated list of the respondent numbers. The question says ""list all respondents"", so their identifiers are like Respondent11, which is '11', etc. So the answer is 11, 8, 5.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents who scored the same on 'Background (history)' as respondent '23'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The goal is to find all respondents who scored the same on 'Background (history)' as respondent '23'. 

First, I need to understand what 'Background (history)' refers to in the data. Looking at the questions section, there's a question with the predicate `pred:Background_history` which has the text ""Gives appropriate history. [Rubric: 0 = History is unstructured or non-relevant, 1 = Relevant history but frequent clarification needed, 2 = Relevant history with few further questions needed, 3 = Comprehensive focused history]"". So, the score for each respondent under `pred:Background_history` is what we're interested in.

Next, I need to find the score of respondent 23. Checking the responses, `:Respondent23` has `pred:Background_history ""2""`. So, we're looking for all other respondents who also have a `pred:Background_history` value of 2.

Now, I'll go through each respondent in the data and check their `pred:Background_history` value:

- Respondent20: pred:Background_history ""2"" → Score 2
- Respondent5: pred:Background_history ""3"" → Score 3
- Respondent23: Already the target, score 2 (but we exclude them as per the task)
- Respondent13: pred:Background_history ""2"" → Score 2
- Respondent22: pred:Background_history ""3"" → Score 3
- Respondent6: pred:Background_history ""3"" → Score 3
- Respondent18: pred:Background_history ""2"" → Score 2
- Respondent17: pred:Background_history ""3"" → Score 3
- Respondent12: pred:Background_history ""3"" → Score 3
- Respondent8: pred:Background_history ""3"" → Score 3

So, the respondents with a score of 2 in Background_history are Respondent20, Respondent13, and Respondent18. Excluding Respondent23 themselves, the answer should be these three.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents who scored the same on 'Situation' as respondent '15'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The question is asking to list all respondents who scored the same on 'Situation' as respondent '15'. 

First, I need to find out what score respondent 15 got for the 'Situation' question. Looking at the responses section, I'll search for :Respondent15. Here's the entry:

:Respondent15 a :Person ;
    pred:Date ""2025-05-04"" ;
    pred:SessionName ""III - Sepsis"" ;
    pred:Identification ""3"" ;
    pred:Situation ""3"" ;
    ... (other properties)

So, the 'Situation' score for respondent 15 is ""3"". 

Next, I need to find all other respondents who also have a 'Situation' score of ""3"", excluding respondent 15 themselves. Let's go through each respondent one by one.

- :Respondent14: pred:Situation ""3"" → Score 3. So, include this one.
- :Respondent12: pred:Situation ""3"" → Score 3. Include.
- :Respondent22: pred:Situation ""3"" → Score 3. Include.
- :Respondent8: pred:Situation ""3"" → Score 3. Include.
- :Respondent15: Already checked, score 3, but we exclude them as per the task.

So, the respondents with 'Situation' score 3 are 14, 12, 22, 8, and 15. But since we need to exclude respondent 15, the final list is 14, 12, 22, and 8.

Wait, but let me double-check each entry to make sure I didn't miss any. Let's confirm each:

- Respondent14: Situation ""3"" → yes.
- Respondent12: Situation ""3"" → yes.
- Respondent22: Situation ""3"" → yes.
- Respondent8: Situation ""3"" → yes.
- Respondent15: Excluded.

No other respondents are present in the data provided. The answer should be the list of their IDs: 14, 12, 22, 8.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents who scored the same on 'Background (examination)' as respondent '22'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The question is asking to list all respondents who scored the same on 'Background (examination)' as respondent '22'. 

First, I need to find out what score respondent 22 has for the 'Background_examination' predicate. Looking at the data for :Respondent22, I see the line:

:Respondent22 a :Person ;
    pred:Date ""2025-05-16"" ;
    pred:SessionName ""IV (VT)"" ;
    pred:Identification ""3"" ;
    pred:Situation ""3"" ;
    pred:Background_history ""3"" ;
    pred:Background_examination ""3"" ;
    ... 

So, the 'Background_examination' score for respondent 22 is ""3"". 

Now, I need to go through all other respondents and check their 'Background_examination' scores. Let's list them one by one:

- :Respondent15: pred:Background_examination ""3"" → score 3
- :Respondent10: pred:Background_examination ""2"" → score 2
- :Respondent13: pred:Background_examination ""1"" → score 1
- :Respondent17: pred:Background_examination ""3"" → score 3
- :Respondent20: pred:Background_examination ""-1"" → score -1
- :Respondent14: pred:Background_examination ""2"" → score 2
- :Respondent6: pred:Background_examination ""3"" → score 3
- :Respondent7: pred:Background_examination ""3"" → score 3
- :Respondent21: pred:Background_examination ""1"" → score 1
- :Respondent3: pred:Background_examination ""3"" → score 3
- :Respondent5: pred:Background_examination ""3"" → score 3

Now, the respondents with a 'Background_examination' score of 3 are: 15, 17, 6, 7, 3, 5, and 22. But since the task says to exclude respondent 22 themselves (the question says ""as respondent '22'"", but doesn't explicitly state to exclude them, but usually such questions imply excluding the original unless told otherwise. Wait, the original example had a similar question where they excluded the respondent themselves. Let me check the example again. In the example, the task was to find respondents who had a session on the same date as respondent '19', excluding the respondent themselves. So, following that pattern, here we should also exclude respondent 22. 

So, the respondents with score 3, excluding 22, are: 15, 17, 6, 7, 3, 5. 

Wait, let me confirm each of their scores again:

- Respondent15: 3 ✅
- Respondent17: 3 ✅
- Respondent6: 3 ✅
- Respondent7: 3 ✅
- Respondent3: 3 ✅
- Respondent5: 3 ✅

Yes, all these have 3. So the answer should be these numbers, listed as a comma-separated list.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondents participated in the same session name as respondent '23'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find which respondents participated in the same session name as respondent '23'. First, I need to look at the data provided for respondent 23.

Looking at the responses section, :Respondent23 has the pred:SessionName ""II-Anaphylaxsis"". Wait, the session name here is ""II-Anaphylaxsis"". But I notice that the spelling might be a typo. The correct term is ""Anaphylaxis"", right? Let me check other respondents to see if there's a similar session name. 

Looking at :Respondent12, their SessionName is ""II (Anaphylaxis)"". The spelling here is ""Anaphylaxis"", which is the correct medical term. So, it's possible that ""Anaphylaxsis"" in respondent 23 is a typo. Since the question is about the session name, I should consider whether these are considered the same despite the typo. 

Next, I need to check all other respondents' SessionNames. Let's go through each one:

- Respondent14: ""IV-Hypoglycemia"" – different.
- Respondent3: ""III-Sepsis"" – different.
- Respondent8: ""III (Sepsis)"" – different.
- Respondent15: ""III - Sepsis"" – different.
- Respondent12: ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" – same as respondent23's session name but with correct spelling.
- Respondent1: ""V (Hypoglycemia)"" – different.

So, the only other respondent with a session name that matches (assuming the typo is an error) is Respondent12. However, the exact session names are ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" for 23 and ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" for 12. The question is whether these are considered the same session. The session names are similar but not identical. However, given that the session number (II) and the condition (Anaphylaxis vs. Anaphylaxsis) are likely referring to the same scenario, it's possible that this is a typo and they are intended to be the same session. 

But according to the data as given, the session names are different. However, the task is to find respondents with the same session name. If we take the session names exactly as written, then Respondent23's session is ""II-Anaphylaxsis"", and no one else has that exact name. Respondent12's session is ""II (Anaphylaxis)"", which is different. Therefore, there might be no other respondents with the same session name. 

Wait, but maybe the session name is case-insensitive or punctuation doesn't matter? Let me check. The session names are case-sensitive as per the data. For example, Respondent8 has ""III (Sepsis)"" with parentheses, while Respondent15 has ""III - Sepsis"" with a dash. These are considered different. Similarly, ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" vs. ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" would be different. Therefore, unless there's a typo that's supposed to be corrected, the answer would be that no other respondents share the same session name as Respondent23. 

But the example given in the problem had an answer of ""None"" when looking for the same date as respondent 19. So maybe in this case, even if there's a typo, the system expects exact matches. Therefore, since Respondent23's session name is ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" and no one else has that exact string, the answer would be none. However, Respondent12's session is ""II (Anaphylaxis)"", which is a different string. Therefore, the answer is that there are no other respondents with the same session name as Respondent23.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents who scored the same on 'Situation' as respondent '4'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The goal is to find all respondents who scored the same on 'Situation' as respondent '4'. 

First, I need to locate respondent '4' in the data. Looking through the responses, I see :Respondent4 has a pred:Situation ""3"". So the score we're looking for is 3.

Next, I need to check all other respondents to see who else has a 'Situation' score of 3. Let's go through each respondent one by one.

- Respondent23: pred:Situation ""3"" → matches.
- Respondent5: pred:Situation ""3"" → matches.
- Respondent16: pred:Situation ""3"" → matches.
- Respondent15: pred:Situation ""3"" → matches.
- Respondent1: pred:Situation ""2"" → doesn't match.
- Respondent3: pred:Situation ""2"" → doesn't match.
- Respondent19: pred:Situation ""3"" → matches.
- Respondent9: pred:Situation ""3"" → matches.
- Respondent14: pred:Situation ""3"" → matches.
- Respondent18: pred:Situation ""3"" → matches.
- Respondent21: pred:Situation ""2"" → doesn't match.

Now, compile the list of respondents with 'Situation' score 3, excluding respondent4 themselves. The matching respondents are: 23, 5, 16, 15, 19, 9, 14, 18. 

Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss any. Yes, those are all the ones with ""3"" in Situation. So the final answer should be these IDs separated by commas.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents who scored the same on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' as respondent '12' and also scored perfectly on 'Background (examination)'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find all respondents who scored the same as respondent '12' on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and also scored perfectly on 'Background (examination)'. 

First, I need to understand what each of these terms refers to in the data. The 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' corresponds to the predicate pred:Recommendation_clear_recommendation. The 'Background (examination)' is pred:Background_examination. 

Looking at the questions section, the 'Recommendation_clear_recommendation' has a rubric where 3 is the highest score, meaning ""Clear comprehensive recommendation without questioning"". The 'Background_examination' also has a rubric where 3 is ""Comprehensive focused examination/observations"", which I assume is the perfect score.

Now, I need to find respondent '12' first. Checking the responses, :Respondent12 has pred:Recommendation_clear_recommendation ""3"". So, we're looking for other respondents with a score of 3 in that category. 

Next, they must also have a perfect score (3) in pred:Background_examination. 

Let's go through each respondent:

- :Respondent3: pred:Recommendation_clear_recommendation is 3, and pred:Background_examination is 3. So this one qualifies.
- :Respondent4: Recommendation is 2, Background is 2. No.
- :Respondent16: Recommendation is 2, Background is 3. Doesn't match the recommendation score.
- :Respondent20: Recommendation is 2, Background is -1. No.
- :Respondent18: Recommendation is 2, Background is 2. No.
- :Respondent1: Recommendation is 2, Background is 2. No.
- :Respondent17: Recommendation is 3, Background is 3. This one also qualifies.
- :Respondent8: Recommendation is 2, Background is 2. No.
- :Respondent12: The target, but we need to exclude them? Wait, the task says ""all respondents who scored the same... as respondent '12'"", so including '12'? Wait, the example in the first part excluded the respondent themselves, but the current task doesn't specify exclusion. Wait, the example was about same date, excluding themselves. But here, the task is to list all including '12'? Let me check the task again. The task says ""list all respondents who scored the same... as respondent '12' and also..."". So if '12' meets both conditions, they should be included. But let's check. 

Respondent12's pred:Recommendation_clear_recommendation is 3, and their pred:Background_examination is 3. So they do meet both conditions. So they should be included. 

Continuing:

- :Respondent23: Recommendation is 3, Background is 2. So Background isn't perfect. No.
- :Respondent5: Recommendation is 2, Background is 3. Doesn't match recommendation.
- :Respondent7: Recommendation is 2, Background is 3. No.

So the respondents that meet both conditions are :Respondent3, :Respondent17, and :Respondent12. But wait, let me double-check each.

Respondent3: Recommendation_clear_recommendation is 3, Background_examination is 3. Yes.

Respondent17: Recommendation_clear_recommendation is 3, Background_examination is 3. Yes.

Respondent12: Recommendation_clear_recommendation is 3, Background_examination is 3. Yes.

So the answer should be Respondent3, Respondent12, Respondent17. But wait, the output format says to list them as a comma-separated list of IDs. The example in the output rules shows ""17, 21, 23"" as an example. So the answer should be the IDs without the colon or prefix. So the final answer is 3, 12, 17.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Find all respondents who participated in the same session name as respondent '12' and whose comments contain the word 'Good'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The goal is to find all respondents who participated in the same session name as respondent '12' and whose comments include the word 'Good'. 

First, I need to identify what session name respondent '12' has. Looking at the responses, :Respondent12 has pred:SessionName ""II (Anaphylaxis)"". So the session name is ""II (Anaphylaxis)"". 

Next, I need to find all other respondents with the same session name. But wait, the session names might have variations. For example, ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" vs. ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" or ""II-Anaphylaxsis"". The task says ""same session name"", so I should check if these are considered the same or different. The exact session name for respondent 12 is ""II (Anaphylaxis)"", so I need to look for exact matches. However, looking at the data, other respondents might have similar but not identical session names. Let's check each respondent:

- Respondent12: ""II (Anaphylaxis)""
- Respondent5: ""II - Anaphylaxsis""
- Respondent23: ""II-Anaphylaxsis""
- Respondent6: ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)""

These are all variations of ""II"" sessions related to anaphylaxis, but the exact session names differ. The task specifies ""same session name"", so exact string matching is required. Therefore, only respondents with ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" would match. But looking at the data, no other respondent has ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" exactly. Wait, let me check again.

Wait, respondent12's session name is ""II (Anaphylaxis)"". Are there any others with that exact name? Let's see:

Looking through the responses:

- Respondent12: ""II (Anaphylaxis)""
- Respondent5: ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" (note the hyphen and spelling ""Anaphylaxsis"")
- Respondent23: ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" (different punctuation and spelling)
- Respondent6: ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"" (different suffix)

So, none of the other respondents have the exact session name ""II (Anaphylaxis)"". Therefore, there are no respondents with the exact same session name as respondent12. However, maybe the task considers variations as the same session. But according to the data, the session names are written differently, so unless specified otherwise, exact match is required.

But wait, the task says ""same session name"". So even if the session is similar, unless the name is exactly the same, they are considered different. Therefore, only respondent12 has that exact session name. However, the task also requires that the comments contain the word 'Good'. 

But since there are no other respondents with the exact session name, the answer would be none. However, let's check if any other respondents have session names that might be considered the same. For example, maybe ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" is a typo or variation. But according to the data, these are different session names. So, unless the task allows for variations, which it doesn't specify, we must stick to exact matches.

Wait, but let's check the comments. The task requires that the comments contain 'Good'. Respondent12's comment is ""Good"". So, even if there were others with the same session name, they need to have 'Good' in their comments. But since no one else has the same session name, the answer is none. However, let's verify again.

Wait, looking at respondent8: their session name is ""III (Sepsis)"", which is different. Respondent5's session name is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"", which is different from respondent12's. Respondent23's is ""II-Anaphylaxsis"", again different. Respondent6's is ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"". So no exact matches. Therefore, the answer is that there are no respondents other than respondent12 who have the same session name and 'Good' in comments. But the task says to exclude the respondent themselves. Wait, the original example had a similar task where the answer was ""None"", but in this case, the task is to find respondents with the same session name as respondent12 and comments containing 'Good', excluding respondent12 themselves. But since no one else has the same session name, the answer is none. However, let's check if any other respondents have 'Good' in their comments and the same session name. Wait, respondent5's comment is ""Good clear and precise clinical handover Good"". So 'Good' is present. But their session name is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"", which is not the same as respondent12's. Similarly, respondent8's comment has 'Good', but their session name is ""III (Sepsis)"". Respondent22's comment has 'Good' as well. But their session name is ""IV (VT)"". So none of these have the same session name as respondent12. Therefore, the answer is none.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' is higher than the average 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' for all sessions that happened on the same date as respondent '16's session.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find all respondents whose 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' score is higher than the average of that same score for all sessions that happened on the same date as respondent '16's session. 

First, I need to figure out the date of respondent 16's session. Looking at the responses, :Respondent16 has pred:Date ""2025-05-02"". So, all sessions on 2025-05-02 are relevant.

Next, I need to find all respondents who had a session on that date. Checking each respondent's date:

- Respondent8: 2025-05-02
- Respondent1: 2025-05-02
- Respondent16: 2025-05-02 (but we'll exclude this one when calculating the average since we need others on the same date)
- Respondent16 is the one we're comparing against, but the average should be of others on the same date, excluding themselves? Wait, the task says ""for all sessions that happened on the same date as respondent '16's session."" So does that include respondent16 in the average? The question isn't clear, but since it's the average for all sessions on that date, including respondent16's own score. Wait, but the task is to compare each respondent's score to the average of all sessions on that date. So the average includes all, including respondent16. Then, for each respondent on that date, check if their score is higher than the average.

Wait, no. The task says: ""Find all respondents whose 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' is higher than the average 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' for all sessions that happened on the same date as respondent '16's session.""

So first, the date is 2025-05-02. Then, calculate the average of all sessions on that date (including respondent16's session). Then, find all respondents (regardless of their date) whose 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' is higher than that average. Wait, no. Wait, the task is a bit ambiguous. Let me read it again.

The task is: ""Find all respondents whose 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' is higher than the average 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' for all sessions that happened on the same date as respondent '16's session.""

So, the average is calculated over all sessions that occurred on the same date as respondent16's session (2025-05-02). Then, any respondent (regardless of their session date) whose 'Recommendation (clear recommendation' score is higher than that average should be listed. Wait, no. Wait, the way it's phrased is: the average is for sessions on the same date as respondent16's session. Then, compare each respondent's score to that average, regardless of their own session date. But that doesn't make sense. Because the average is specific to sessions on 2025-05-02. So the task is to find all respondents (from all dates) whose score is higher than the average of the 2025-05-02 sessions. But that's possible. For example, if the average on 2025-05-02 is 2, then any respondent with a score higher than 2, regardless of their date, would be included. But that's not what the task is asking. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Alternatively, perhaps the task is to find respondents who are on the same date as respondent16 (i.e., 2025-05-02) and have a score higher than the average of that date's sessions. That would make more sense. Let me re-read the task.

The task says: ""Find all respondents whose 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' is higher than the average 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' for all sessions that happened on the same date as respondent '16's session.""

So, the average is calculated over all sessions on the same date as respondent16's session (2025-05-02). Then, among all respondents (regardless of their date?), find those whose score is higher than that average. But that would include respondents from other dates. But that's possible. For example, if the average on 2025-05-02 is 2, then any respondent with a score higher than 2, even if their session was on a different date, would be included. But that seems odd. Alternatively, maybe the task is to find respondents who are on the same date as respondent16 (i.e., 2025-05-02) and have a score higher than the average of that date's sessions. That would make more sense. Let me check the wording again.

The key part is: ""for all sessions that happened on the same date as respondent '16's session."" So the average is computed over those sessions. Then, the respondents we are considering are those whose score is higher than that average. The task doesn't specify that the respondents must be on the same date. But that's possible. For example, if the average is 2, then any respondent (from any date) with a score higher than 2 would be included. But that seems unlikely. The more logical interpretation is that we are looking for respondents who are on the same date as respondent16 (2025-05-02) and have a score higher than the average of that date's sessions. Because otherwise, the average is specific to that date, but the comparison is across all dates, which may not be meaningful. Let's proceed with that interpretation.

So, first, find the date of respondent16: 2025-05-02.

Then, collect all sessions on that date. The respondents on that date are:

- Respondent8
- Respondent1
- Respondent16
- Respondent16's own session.

Wait, looking at the data:

:Respondent8 has date 2025-05-02.

:Respondent1 has date 2025-05-02.

:Respondent16 has date 2025-05-02.

So three respondents: 8, 1, 16.

Now, for each of these, we need to calculate their 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' score and compare it to the average of all three.

First, get the scores:

Respondent8: pred:Recommendation_clear_recommendation ""2""

Respondent1: pred:Recommendation_clear_recommendation ""2""

Respondent16: pred:Recommendation_clear_recommendation ""2""

So all three have a score of 2. The average is (2 + 2 + 2)/3 = 2. So the average is 2. Now, we need to find respondents (from the same date) whose score is higher than 2. But all three have a score of 2, which is equal to the average, not higher. Therefore, there are no respondents on that date with a score higher than the average. Hence, the answer would be none.

Wait, but the task says ""all respondents"" not limited to the same date. Wait, no. Let me recheck the task again.

The task is: ""Find all respondents whose 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' is higher than the average 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' for all sessions that happened on the same date as respondent '16's session.""

So the average is calculated over the sessions on 2025-05-02 (respondent16's date). Then, any respondent (from any date) whose score is higher than that average (which is 2) should be included.

So now, we need to look at all respondents in the data and check if their 'Recommendation_clear_recommendation' is higher than 2.

Looking at all respondents:

- Respondent21: 3
- Respondent9: 3
- Respondent8: 2
- Respondent4: 2
- Respondent1: 2
- Respondent6: 2
- Respondent16: 2
- Respondent13: 2
- Respondent15: 2
- Respondent22: 2

So the scores are:

Respondent21: 3

Respondent9: 3

Others: 2 or 2.

So the average for the date 2025-05-02 is 2. So any respondent with a score higher than 2 would be included. So respondents 21 and 9 have scores of 3, which is higher than 2. Therefore, the answer should be Respondent21 and Respondent9.

But wait, their sessions are on different dates. Respondent21's date is 2025-05-16, and Respondent9's date is 2025-05-04. But the task doesn't restrict the respondents to the same date as 16; it's only the average that's calculated based on that date. So even though they are on different dates, their scores are compared to the average of 2. So they would be included.

But that seems a bit counterintuitive. The task is to find all respondents (regardless of their date) whose score is higher than the average of the sessions on 2025-05-02. So yes, that's the case. So the answer would be Respondent21 and Respondent9.

But wait, let me check again. The average is 2. So any respondent with a score >2 is included. Looking at the data:

Respondent21: 3

Respondent9: 3

Others: 2 or lower.

So the answer should be Respondent21 and Respondent9.

But wait, the example given in the problem had a similar structure, and the answer was ""None"". But in that example, the task was to find respondents on the same date as 19, excluding themselves. But in this case, the answer is different.

So according to the data, the correct answer would be Respondent21 and Respondent9, as their scores are 3, which is higher than the average of 2.
</think>

To solve the problem, we first determine the date of respondent '16's session, which is ""2025-05-02"". We then calculate the average 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' score for all sessions on this date. The relevant respondents on this date are:

- **Respondent8**: Score = 2  
- **Respondent1**: Score = 2  
- **Respondent16**: Score = 2  

**Average score** = (2 + 2 + 2) / 3 = **2**.

Next, we identify all respondents (regardless of their session date) with a score **higher than 2** in the dataset:

- **Respondent21**: Score = 3  
- **Respondent9**: Score = 3  

These respondents have scores exceeding the average of 2.  

**Answer**: Respondent21, Respondent9",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'Situation' is higher than the average 'Situation' for all sessions that happened on the same date as respondent '23's session.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondents are from a session name where the average 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' score is higher than the overall average for all sessions?
</task>",,False
