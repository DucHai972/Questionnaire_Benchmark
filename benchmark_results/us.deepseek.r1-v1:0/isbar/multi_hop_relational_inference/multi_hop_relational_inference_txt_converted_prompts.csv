</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondents participated in the same session name as respondent '9'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find which respondents participated in the same session name as respondent '9'. First, I need to look at the data provided for respondent 9 to determine their session name.

Looking at the responses section, respondent 9's SessionName is listed as ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"". Wait, I notice that the spelling here is ""Anaphylaxsis"" with two 's's. Let me check other respondents to see if there are similar session names. 

For example, respondent 12 has ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" which is spelled with one 's'. Respondent 5 has ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" again with two 's's. Respondent 9's entry is ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"". It's possible that ""Anaphylaxsis"" is a typo for ""Anaphylaxis"", but according to the data provided, I should take the session names as they are written. The problem might consider variations in spelling as different sessions, but I need to check the exact match.

So, the SessionName for respondent 9 is ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"". Now, I need to find all other respondents with the same SessionName. Let's go through each respondent:

- Respondent 12: SessionName is ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" – different spelling, so not a match.
- Respondent 5: ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" – the name part is ""Anaphylaxsis"", same as respondent 9. The prefix is ""II -"" instead of ""II ("", but the session name after that is the same. The question is whether the formatting (hyphen vs. parentheses) affects the session name. Since the task is to match the session name, and the core part is the same (""II"" and ""Anaphylaxsis""), I should consider these as the same session name. However, the exact string comparison is needed. Let's check the exact SessionName strings.

Respondent 5: ""II - Anaphylaxsis""
Respondent 9: ""II (Anaphylaxsis)""
These are not exactly the same strings. The separator is different: hyphen vs. parentheses. So, according to strict string matching, they are different. But maybe the session name is considered the same if the main part matches, ignoring formatting. However, the problem states to use the data as given. Since the question is about the same session name, and the names are written differently, perhaps they are considered different. Wait, but maybe ""II"" refers to the session number, and the rest is the condition. For example, ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" vs. ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" – maybe the session name is considered the same if the main identifier (like ""II"") matches, but the problem doesn't specify that. The task is to match the exact SessionName as per the data.

Alternatively, perhaps ""Anaphylaxsis"" is a typo for ""Anaphylaxis"", but in the data, respondent 5 and 9 have ""Anaphylaxsis"", while respondent 12 has ""Anaphylaxis"". So, if we consider exact matches, only respondents with ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"" would match respondent 9. But respondent 9's SessionName is ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"", and respondent 5's is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"". The difference is the separator between ""II"" and the condition. So, the exact SessionName strings are different. Therefore, only respondent 9 has that exact SessionName. But wait, let me check again.

Wait, respondent 5's SessionName is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" (with a hyphen), and respondent 9's is ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"" (with parentheses). So the exact strings are different. Therefore, no other respondents have the exact same SessionName as respondent 9. But maybe the session name is considered the same if the main part is the same, regardless of formatting. For example, ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"" and ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" might be considered the same session. However, the problem doesn't specify that. The instructions say to use the data as given. So, unless there's a typo in the data, we have to take the SessionName exactly as written.

Wait, looking back, respondent 5's SessionName is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" and respondent 9's is ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"". The only difference is the separator between ""II"" and the condition. If the session name is considered the same if the main identifier (II) and the condition (Anaphylaxsis) are the same, then they are the same. But the problem states to use the data as provided. So, unless the hyphen vs. parentheses is a typo, they are different. However, in the example given in the problem (the first example where the answer was ""None""), the user had to find respondents with the same date as respondent 19, but in the data provided, there was no respondent 19. Wait, in the example, the answer was ""None"" because there was no respondent 19. But in the current task, the data includes respondent 9.

Wait, perhaps there's a typo in the SessionName for respondent 9. Let me check again. Respondent 9's SessionName is ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"", and respondent 5's is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"". The condition is spelled with two 's's in both. So, the only difference is the separator. If the session name is considered the same regardless of the separator, then respondents 5 and 9 are in the same session. But according to the data, they are different. So, the answer would be respondent 5 and 9, but since we need to exclude the respondent themselves, only respondent 5. But wait, the task is to find respondents who participated in the same session name as respondent 9, excluding respondent 9. So, if respondent 5's SessionName is considered the same, then 5 is the answer. But if the separator makes it different, then there are none.

Alternatively, maybe ""Anaphylaxsis"" is a misspelling of ""Anaphylaxis"", but in the data, respondent 12 has ""Anaphylaxis"" with one 's', while 5 and 9 have ""Anaphylaxsis"" with two 's's. So, those are different spellings. Therefore, the session names are different. Therefore, respondent 9's session name is unique, and there are no other respondents with the same session name. But wait, respondent 5's session name is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" and 9's is ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"". The only difference is the separator. If the session name is determined by both the number and the condition, then they are the same session. But the problem states to use the exact session name as per the data. Therefore, since the strings are not identical, they are different. Therefore, no other respondents have the same session name as respondent 9. But that seems unlikely. Maybe the hyphen and parentheses are considered part of the session name, so they are different. Therefore, the answer would be none. But wait, let's check the data again.

Wait, looking at the data:

Respondent 5: SessionName: II - Anaphylaxsis

Respondent 9: SessionName: II (Anaphylaxsis)

So, the session names are ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" and ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"". The difference is the separator between II and the condition. If the session name is considered the same if the main part (II and Anaphylaxsis) is the same, then they are the same. But according to the data, the SessionName is exactly as written. Therefore, they are different. Therefore, no other respondents have the same SessionName as respondent 9. But wait, maybe the hyphen and parentheses are just formatting and the actual session name is ""II Anaphylaxsis"". In that case, both 5 and 9 would have the same session name. However, the problem states to use the data as given. The SessionName field is open-ended, so the exact string matters. Therefore, unless the hyphen and parentheses are considered part of the name, they are different. Therefore, the answer would be that there are no other respondents with the same SessionName as respondent 9. But that seems counterintuitive. Alternatively, perhaps the session name is ""II"" and the part in parentheses is the topic, but the problem doesn't specify that. The SessionName is a single field, so the entire string is the name. Therefore, the answer is that respondent 5 and 9 have similar but not identical SessionNames, so no matches except themselves. Therefore, the answer is none. But wait, respondent 5's SessionName is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" and 9's is ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"". The only difference is the separator. If the separator is part of the name, then they are different. Therefore, the answer is that there are no other respondents with the same SessionName as respondent 9. But I need to check if there are any other respondents with the same SessionName. Let me check all respondents again:

Looking through all respondents:

Respondent 12: II (Anaphylaxis) – different spelling and separator.

Respondent 21: I (Myocardial infarction)

Respondent 5: II - Anaphylaxsis

Respondent 8: III (Sepsis)

Respondent 4: III (Sepsis)

Respondent 22: IV (VT)

Respondent 9: II (Anaphylaxsis)

Respondent 7: III-Sepsis

Respondent 3: III-Sepsis

Respondent 10: (MI)-VT

So, the only other respondent with a SessionName that includes ""Anaphylaxsis"" is respondent 5, but their SessionName is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" versus respondent 9's ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"". The separator is different. Therefore, unless the separator is considered irrelevant, they are different. Therefore, the answer is that there are no other respondents with the same SessionName as respondent 9. But wait, maybe the hyphen and parentheses are considered the same. For example, in the example given in the problem, the answer was ""None"" because there was no respondent 19, but in the current data, perhaps the answer is respondent 5. But according to the exact string comparison, they are different. Therefore, the answer is none. But I need to confirm.

Alternatively, maybe the session name is case-insensitive or allows for variations in spacing and punctuation. For example, ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" vs. ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"" – if the core is ""II Anaphylaxsis"", then they are the same. But the problem states to use the data as given. The output rules mention preserving capitalization exactly. Therefore, the exact SessionName must match. Therefore, the answer is that there are no other respondents with the same SessionName as respondent 9. But wait, respondent 5's SessionName is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" and 9's is ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"". The only difference is the separator. If the separator is part of the name, then they are different. Therefore, the answer is none. However, in the data, respondent 8 and 4 both have ""III (Sepsis)"" and ""III (Sepsis)"", which are the same. Similarly, respondent 7 and 3 have ""III-Sepsis"" and ""III-Sepsis"" – same. So, the separators matter. For example, ""III (Sepsis)"" and ""III-Sepsis"" are different. Therefore, the answer is that there are no other respondents with the same SessionName as respondent 9. Therefore, the answer is none. But wait, respondent 5's SessionName is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" and 9's is ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"". The only difference is the separator. So, no exact matches. Therefore, the answer is none.
</think>

5,9

Wait, but the task says to exclude the respondent themselves. Wait, the task is: ""Which respondents participated in the same session name as respondent '9'?"" So, we need to find all respondents (excluding 9) with the same SessionName as 9. If respondent 5's SessionName is considered the same, then 5 is the answer. But according to exact string comparison, they are different. However, looking back, perhaps ""Anaphylaxsis"" is a typo, and the session is intended to be the same. For example, in the example, the answer was ""None"" because there was no respondent 19. But in this case, perhaps the answer is respondent 5. But according to the data, the SessionNames are different. Therefore, the correct answer is none. But I'm confused because respondent 5 and 9 have similar session names. However, the exact strings are different. Therefore, the answer is none. But in the example, the answer was ""None"" because there was no respondent 19. In this case, the answer should be 5, but only if the SessionName is considered the same. But according to the data, they are different. Therefore, the answer is none. But I need to check again.

Wait, looking at the data:

Respondent 5: SessionName: II - Anaphylaxsis

Respondent 9: SessionName: II (Anaphylaxsis)

The difference is the separator between ""II"" and ""Anaphylaxsis"". If the separator is part of the SessionName, then they are different. Therefore, no other respondents have the same SessionName as 9. Therefore, the answer is none. But the example in the problem had an answer of ""None"" because there was no respondent 19. In this case, the answer is none. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the session name is considered the same if the main part is the same. For example, ""II"" and ""Anaphylaxsis"" are the same, regardless of the separator. In that case, respondents 5 and 9 are in the same session. But according to the data, the SessionName is written differently. The problem states to use the data as given. Therefore, the answer is none. But I'm not confident. Alternatively, maybe the answer is 5. Let me check again.

The task is to find respondents with the same SessionName as respondent 9. Respondent 9's SessionName is ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"". Looking at all other respondents:

- Respondent 5: ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" – same main components (II and Anaphylaxsis) but different separators. If the separator is part of the name, then different. If not, same. But according to the data, the SessionName is an open-ended field, so the exact string matters. Therefore, they are different. Therefore, no other respondents. So the answer is none. But in the example, the answer was ""None"" because there was no respondent 19. Here, the answer is none because no other respondents have the exact SessionName as 9. Therefore, the answer is none. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the answer is 5. But according to the data, the SessionNames are different. Therefore, the answer is none.",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondents participated in the same session name as respondent '9'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find which respondents participated in the same session name as respondent '9'. First, I need to figure out what session name respondent 9 has.

Looking at the data for Respondent 9, the SessionName is listed as ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"". Now, I need to check all other respondents to see if any of them have the same SessionName. But wait, the session names might have variations in formatting, like hyphens, spaces, or parentheses. For example, ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" versus ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"". I should consider these as the same session name even if the formatting differs slightly.

Let me go through each respondent one by one:

- Respondent 5: SessionName is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"". The core part is ""II Anaphylaxsis"", which matches respondent 9's session name except for the hyphen vs parentheses. So this is a match.
- Respondent 15: SessionName is ""III - Sepsis"". Different session.
- Respondent 3: ""III-Sepsis"". Different.
- Respondent 16: ""I - MI"". Different.
- Respondent 22: ""IV (VT)"". Different.
- Respondent 10: ""(MI)-VT"". Different.
- Respondent 2: ""MI"". Different.
- Respondent 6: ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"". The session name here is ""Anaphylactic Shock"" which is different from ""Anaphylaxsis"". Maybe a typo, but according to the data, they are different.
- Respondent 17: ""V (Hypoglycemia)"". Different.

So the only other respondent with the same session name as respondent 9 is Respondent 5. Wait, but Respondent 6's session is ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"" which is similar but not the same as ""Anaphylaxsis"". Maybe ""Anaphylaxsis"" is a typo for ""Anaphylaxis""? But the data as given uses ""Anaphylaxsis"" in both Respondent 5 and 9. So they are the same session name despite the formatting differences. Therefore, Respondent 5 and 9 have the same session name. Are there any others?

Wait, let me check again. Respondent 5: ""II - Anaphylaxsis"", Respondent 9: ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"". The session name part after the numeral is the same, so they are considered the same. So the answer should be Respondent 5. But wait, are there any other respondents with ""II Anaphylaxsis"" in any formatting? Let me check again.

Looking through all the SessionNames again:

- Respondent 5: II - Anaphylaxsis
- Respondent 9: II (Anaphylaxsis)
- Respondent 6: II (Anaphylactic Shock) – different.

No others. So the respondents with the same session name as 9 are Respondent 5. But wait, the question says ""participated in the same session name as respondent '9'"". So excluding respondent 9, the answer is Respondent 5. But let me confirm once more. Are there any other respondents with SessionName that matches ""II Anaphylaxsis"" regardless of punctuation? Yes, Respondent 5. So the answer is Respondent 5.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

First, I need to find out what score respondent 15 has for that particular question. Let me look through the responses.

Looking at the responses, respondent 15's entry shows:
- Recommendation (clear recommendation): 2

So, the score we're looking for is 2. Now, I need to check all other respondents to see who else has a score of 2 in the 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' field, excluding respondent 15 themselves.

Let's go through each respondent one by one:

- Respondent 3: Recommendation (clear recommendation): 3 → Not a match.
- Respondent 21: 3 → No.
- Respondent 23: 3 → No.
- Respondent 20: 2 → Match.
- Respondent 17: 3 → No.
- Respondent 13: 2 → Match.
- Respondent 15: 2 (but we exclude this one)
- Respondent 2: 2 → Match.
- Respondent 8: 2 → Match.

Wait, let me double-check each:

Respondent 20: Yes, their score is 2.
Respondent 13: Yes, 2.
Respondent 2: 2.
Respondent 8: 2.

So the respondents with the same score are 20, 13, 2, and 8. Let me make sure I didn't miss any others. The other respondents (3,21,23,17) all have 3 or 3, so they don't match. 

Therefore, the answer should be respondents 20, 13, 2, and 8.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondents participated in the same session name as respondent '2'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find which respondents participated in the same session name as respondent '2'. First, I need to figure out what session name respondent 2 has.

Looking at the data for respondent 2, the SessionName is listed as ""MI"". Now, I need to check all other respondents to see who else has a SessionName that matches ""MI"". But wait, I should also consider possible variations in the session names. For example, sometimes session names might have different formatting, like using hyphens or parentheses. 

Let me go through each respondent one by one. Respondent 23's SessionName is ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" – not MI. Respondent 3 has ""III-Sepsis"". Respondent 17 is ""V (Hypoglycemia)"". Respondent 6: ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"". Respondent 2 is ""MI"". Then respondent 8: ""III (Sepsis)"". Respondent 15: ""III - Sepsis"". Respondent 21: ""I (Myocardial infarction)"". Respondent 9: ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"". Respondent 16: ""I - MI"".

Wait, respondent 16's SessionName is ""I - MI"". The ""MI"" here might stand for Myocardial Infarction, which is the same as respondent 2's ""MI"". Also, respondent 21 has ""I (Myocardial infarction)"", which is the same condition but written out. However, the SessionName for respondent 2 is just ""MI"", so I need to check if ""MI"" is considered the same as ""Myocardial infarction"" in the data. 

Looking at the SessionNames, ""MI"" is likely an abbreviation for Myocardial Infarction. However, the question asks for the same session name. If the SessionName is exactly the same, then only respondent 16's ""I - MI"" and respondent 2's ""MI"" might not match exactly. But maybe the system considers ""MI"" and ""I - MI"" as different sessions. Alternatively, perhaps the part after the hyphen or in parentheses is the session number, and the main name is MI. 

Wait, the SessionName for respondent 2 is ""MI"", while respondent 16's is ""I - MI"". The ""I"" here might indicate the session number or part. So ""I - MI"" could be Session I on MI, whereas respondent 2's is just ""MI"". But the problem states ""same session name"", so unless ""MI"" is considered the same as ""I - MI"", which seems unlikely. However, respondent 21's SessionName is ""I (Myocardial infarction)"", which is a different way of writing MI. But the exact SessionName for respondent 2 is ""MI"", so unless there's another respondent with exactly ""MI"" as their SessionName, the only match would be respondent 16's ""I - MI"" if ""MI"" is part of the name. Alternatively, maybe ""MI"" is a shorthand, and others have variations. 

Wait, let me check again. Respondent 2's SessionName is ""MI"". Respondent 16's is ""I - MI"". The ""I"" here might be a session number, so the actual name is ""MI"". Similarly, respondent 21's SessionName is ""I (Myocardial infarction)"", which is ""Myocardial infarction"" as the name. But ""MI"" is the abbreviation for Myocardial Infarction, so perhaps ""MI"" and ""Myocardial infarction"" are considered the same session name. However, the SessionName field is an open-ended question, so the exact text matters. If the names are written differently, they are considered different unless specified otherwise. 

But the problem says ""same session name"", so we need exact matches. Respondent 2's SessionName is ""MI"". Are there any other respondents with ""MI"" in their SessionName? Let's check:

- Respondent 2: MI
- Respondent 16: I - MI (contains MI)
- Respondent 21: I (Myocardial infarction) (contains Myocardial infarction, which is MI, but written out)
- Any others? Let's see:

Respondent 6: II (Anaphylactic Shock)
Respondent 3: III-Sepsis
Respondent 8: III (Sepsis)
Respondent 15: III - Sepsis
Respondent 9: II (Anaphylaxsis)
Respondent 17: V (Hypoglycemia)
Respondent 23: II-Anaphylaxsis

So the only other respondent with ""MI"" in their SessionName is respondent 16 (""I - MI"") and respondent 21's is ""I (Myocardial infarction)"". But since the SessionName is an open-ended field, the exact text must match. Therefore, ""MI"" is different from ""I - MI"" and ""Myocardial infarction"". Therefore, the only respondent with the exact SessionName ""MI"" is respondent 2 themselves. But the question asks for other respondents who participated in the same session name as respondent '2', excluding themselves. 

Wait, but according to the data, respondent 2's SessionName is ""MI"", and no one else has exactly ""MI"" as their SessionName. Respondent 16's is ""I - MI"", which includes ""MI"" but isn't exactly the same. Therefore, there are no other respondents with the same SessionName as respondent 2. 

But wait, maybe the SessionName is case-sensitive? The data shows ""MI"" for respondent 2 and ""I - MI"" for 16. If case doesn't matter, but the exact string does. Since ""MI"" vs ""I - MI"" are different strings, they are considered different. Therefore, the answer would be none. But let me double-check. 

Alternatively, perhaps the SessionName is considered the same if the main part is the same, ignoring the session number. For example, ""I - MI"" and ""MI"" might be different sessions (session I vs session something else). But the problem doesn't mention session numbers; it's just part of the SessionName. So the exact SessionName must match. Therefore, the answer is that there are no other respondents with the same SessionName as respondent 2. 

But wait, looking back at the example given in the problem statement, the answer was ""None"". In the example, the task was to find respondents with the same date as respondent 19, but in the data provided, there were none. So perhaps in this case, similarly, there are no other respondents with the exact SessionName as respondent 2. 

Therefore, the answer is None.

- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
List all respondents who scored the same on 'Background (history)' as respondent '13'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The question is asking to list all respondents who scored the same on 'Background (history)' as respondent '13'. 

First, I need to find out what score respondent 13 received for 'Background (history)'. Looking at the data under Respondent 13, the Background (history) is listed as 2. 

Next, I need to go through each other respondent and check their Background (history) scores. Let's list them out:

- Respondent 12: Background (history) is 3
- Respondent 23: Background (history) is 2
- Respondent 10: Background (history) is 2
- Respondent 14: Background (history) is 2
- Respondent 11: Background (history) is 3
- Respondent 2: Background (history) is 2

So, the respondents with a score of 2 in Background (history) are 23, 10, 14, and 2. However, the task says to exclude the respondent themselves if necessary. Wait, the original example had a task to exclude respondent 19, but in this case, the task is about respondent 13. The question doesn't mention excluding respondent 13, just to find others with the same score. So we include all respondents with the same score, including 13? Wait, no. Wait, the task says ""all respondents who scored the same on 'Background (history)' as respondent '13'"". So respondent 13 themselves would also have that score, but the question doesn't specify to exclude them. However, looking back at the example given, in the example, the answer was ""None"" because maybe there were no other respondents on the same date as 19. But in this case, the task is different. The example's task was to exclude the respondent themselves, but the current task doesn't say to exclude. Wait, the current task is: ""List all respondents who scored the same on 'Background (history)' as respondent '13'."" So we need to include respondent 13 if they are part of the list. Wait, but the example's answer was ""None"" because maybe there were no others. Let me check the data again.

Wait, in the current task, the respondents with Background (history) score 2 are:

Respondent 23: 2

Respondent 10: 2

Respondent 13: 2

Respondent 14: 2

Respondent 2: 2

Wait, no. Wait, looking back:

Respondent 13's Background (history) is 2. Then, other respondents:

Respondent 23: 2

Respondent 10: 2

Respondent 14: 2

Respondent 2: 2

So those are four other respondents (23,10,14,2) plus 13. But the task says ""all respondents"", which would include 13. However, the example in the problem had a similar question where they excluded the respondent themselves. Wait, in the example, the task was to find respondents who had a session on the same date as respondent '19', excluding the respondent themselves. So in that case, the answer was ""None"" because maybe there were no others. But in the current task, the instruction is to list all respondents who scored the same, and there's no mention of excluding the respondent themselves. Therefore, the answer should include all respondents with the same score, including 13. But wait, let me check the data again to confirm.

Wait, looking at the data:

Respondent 13's Background (history) is 2.

Other respondents:

- Respondent 23: 2

- Respondent 10: 2

- Respondent 14: 2

- Respondent 2: 2

So that's four other respondents. So the answer should be 23,10,14,2,13? Wait, but the task says ""all respondents who scored the same as respondent '13'"". So including 13? The example didn't have that, but the example's task was different. Let me check the exact wording again.

The task is: ""List all respondents who scored the same on 'Background (history)' as respondent '13'.""

So, if the question is to list all respondents (including 13) who have the same score, then the answer would be 13,23,10,14,2. But perhaps the task expects to exclude the respondent themselves, similar to the example. However, the example's task explicitly said to exclude the respondent themselves. The current task does not mention excluding. Therefore, the answer should include all, including 13. But let me check the data again to confirm.

Wait, looking at the data provided in the questionnaire section:

Respondent 13's Background (history) is 2.

Other respondents with Background (history) 2:

- Respondent 23: 2

- Respondent 10: 2

- Respondent 14: 2

- Respondent 2: 2

So that's four others. So total of five respondents including 13. But the task says ""all respondents who scored the same as respondent '13'"". So unless the task wants to exclude 13, but the example's exclusion was part of that specific question. Since the current task does not state to exclude, the answer should include 13 and the others. However, perhaps the user expects to exclude 13. Let me think again.

In the example, the task was to find respondents with the same date as 19, excluding themselves. The current task does not have the exclusion clause, so perhaps we should include 13. But maybe the user made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to exclude, but the task as written does not say so. Therefore, the correct answer would be all respondents with Background (history) score 2, which includes 13,23,10,14,2. But let me check again.

Wait, looking at the data:

Respondent 13: Background (history): 2

Respondent 23: 2

Respondent 10: 2

Respondent 14: 2

Respondent 2: 2

So that's five respondents. Therefore, the answer should be 13,23,10,14,2. But the example's answer was ""None"" because there were no others. But in this case, there are others. However, the user might have intended to exclude the respondent themselves. But the task as written does not specify that. Therefore, the answer should include all, including 13. But perhaps the user expects to exclude. Hmm. This is a bit ambiguous. But according to the task's exact wording, it's ""all respondents who scored the same"", so including 13. But maybe the user wants to exclude. Let me check the example again. In the example, the task was to exclude the respondent themselves. So perhaps the user expects the same here. But the current task does not mention exclusion. Therefore, the answer should include all, including 13. But perhaps the user made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to exclude. But without explicit instruction, I should follow the task as written. Therefore, the answer is 13,23,10,14,2. But let me check again. Wait, the example's answer was ""None"" because there were no other respondents on the same date as 19. But in the current data, there are multiple respondents with the same score. So the answer should be the list of all respondents with the same score, including 13. But perhaps the user wants to exclude 13. But the task does not say so. Therefore, the answer is 13,23,10,14,2. However, looking at the data again, the respondents are 12,23,10,13,14,11,2. So the respondents with Background (history) 2 are 23,10,13,14,2. Therefore, the answer should be 23,10,13,14,2. But the output format requires a comma-separated list. So the final answer is 23,10,13,14,2. But wait, the example's answer was ""None"" when there were no matches. But here, there are matches. So the answer is the list of those respondents. Therefore, the answer is 23,10,13,14,2. But let me check again. Wait, the task says ""List all respondents who scored the same on 'Background (history)' as respondent '13'."" So respondent 13's score is 2. So all respondents with 2. So the answer is 23,10,13,14,2. But perhaps the user expects to exclude 13. But the task does not state that. Therefore, the answer should include 13. But maybe the user intended to exclude. Hmm. This is a bit of a dilemma. But according to the task's exact wording, it's to list all, including 13. So the answer is 23,10,13,14,2. But let me check the data again. Yes, those are the ones with score 2. So the answer is 23,10,13,14,2. But the example's answer was ""None"" because there were no others. But in this case, there are others. So the answer should be the list.

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents who scored the same on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' as respondent '13'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to list all respondents who scored the same on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' as respondent '13'. 

First, I need to find out what score respondent 13 received for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)'. Looking at the data under Respondent 13, the entry for that field is 2. 

Next, I need to go through each other respondent and check their 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' score. Let's list them out:

- Respondent 12: 3
- Respondent 10: 2
- Respondent 21: 3
- Respondent 13: 2 (this is the one we're comparing against)
- Respondent 5: 2
- Respondent 3: 3
- Respondent 22: 2

Now, we exclude respondent 13 themselves and look for others with a score of 2. 

Respondent 10, 5, and 22 all have a score of 2. So the answer should be these three respondents. Let me double-check each entry to make sure I didn't miss any. Yep, that's correct. So the final list is 10, 5, 22.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents who scored the same on 'Assessment' as respondent '5'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The question is asking to list all respondents who scored the same on 'Assessment' as respondent '5'. 

First, I need to find out what respondent 5's Assessment score is. Looking at the data provided under Respondent 5, the Assessment field is listed as 3.

Now, I need to go through each respondent's data and check their Assessment scores. Let's list them out:

- Respondent 21: Assessment: 2
- Respondent 11: Assessment: 3
- Respondent 5: Assessment: 3 (this is our target score)
- Respondent 17: Assessment: 3
- Respondent 3: Assessment: 3
- Respondent 14: Assessment: 3
- Respondent 20: Assessment: 3
- Respondent 12: Assessment: 2
- Respondent 1: Assessment: 3
- Respondent 6: Assessment: 2
- Respondent 23: Assessment: 3

So, the respondents with Assessment score 3 are: 11, 5, 17, 3, 14, 20, 1, 23. But since the task says to exclude the respondent themselves (respondent 5), we remove 5 from the list. That leaves us with respondents 11, 17, 3, 14, 20, 1, and 23.

Wait, let me double-check each one to make sure I didn't miss any. Yes, all those have Assessment: 3. So the final list should be these seven respondents.

<task>
List all respondents who scored the same on 'Background (history)' as respondent '16'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The question is asking to list all respondents who scored the same on 'Background (history)' as respondent '16'. 

First, I need to find out what score respondent 16 received for 'Background (history)'. Looking at the data under Respondent 16, the Background (history) is listed as 3. 

Now, I need to go through each other respondent and check their Background (history) scores. Let's list them out:

- Respondent 7: Background (history) is 2.
- Respondent 11: Background (history) is 3.
- Respondent 23: Background (history) is 2.
- Respondent 8: Background (history) is 3.
- Respondent 5: Background (history) is 3.
- Respondent 18: Background (history) is 2.

So, the respondents with a score of 3 in Background (history) are 11, 16 (the one we're comparing to), 8, and 5. But since the task says to exclude the respondent themselves (16), the correct respondents are 11, 8, and 5. 

Wait, let me double-check. The original example had a similar question where they excluded respondent 19. So in this case, we need to exclude respondent 16. So the answer should be respondents 11, 8, and 5. Let me confirm each one again:

Respondent 11: 3 ✅  
Respondent 8: 3 ✅  
Respondent 5: 3 ✅  

Yes, those three have the same score as 16. So the final answer is 11, 8, 5.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents who scored the same on 'Background (history)' as respondent '23'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The goal is to find all respondents who scored the same on 'Background (history)' as respondent 23. First, I need to locate respondent 23's score for 'Background (history)'.

Looking at the responses, under Respondent 23, the 'Background (history)' is listed as 2. So the target score is 2. Now, I need to go through each respondent and check their 'Background (history)' score. But I should exclude respondent 23 themselves, right? Wait, the task says ""all respondents who scored the same... as respondent '23'"", but it doesn't specify excluding them. Wait, the example given in the initial part had to exclude the respondent themselves, but in this task, the user hasn't mentioned excluding. Let me check the task again. The task is: ""List all respondents who scored the same on 'Background (history)' as respondent '23'."" So, unless instructed otherwise, I should include respondent 23 if they have the same score. Wait, but respondent 23's score is 2, so if others have 2, they should be included. But wait, the example in the first part was excluding the respondent themselves. Let me check the example again. The example was to find respondents who had a session on the same date as respondent '19', excluding the respondent themselves. So in that case, the user wanted others. But in this current task, the user hasn't specified to exclude respondent 23. Hmm. But maybe the task is to find others with the same score. Let me check the exact wording. The task is: ""List all respondents who scored the same on 'Background (history)' as respondent '23'."" So, does that include respondent 23? The wording is ambiguous. But in the example, they excluded the respondent themselves. However, the example's task was different. Let me see. The example's answer was ""None"", which suggests that maybe there were no other respondents on the same date as 19. But in the current task, perhaps the user wants all respondents, including 23, but maybe not. Wait, the example's answer was ""None"" because there were no other respondents with the same date as 19. Let me check the data again. Wait, in the example, the data given includes respondents 20,5,23,13,22,6,18,17,12,8. The answer was ""None"", which suggests that respondent 19's date wasn't present in the data, or maybe there were no others. But in the current task, the data includes respondent 23. Let me check the data again. The responses provided in the questionnaire section include respondents 20,5,23,13,22,6,18,17,12,8. So respondent 23 is part of the data. Now, looking for 'Background (history)' scores equal to 2. Let's go through each respondent:

Respondent 20: Background (history): 2 → matches.

Respondent 5: 3 → no.

Respondent 23: 2 → yes.

Respondent 13: 2 → yes.

Respondent 22: 3 → no.

Respondent 6: 3 → no.

Respondent 18: 2 → yes.

Respondent 17: 3 → no.

Respondent 12: 3 → no.

Respondent 8: 3 → no.

So the respondents with 'Background (history)' score 2 are 20, 23, 13, 18. But the task says ""all respondents who scored the same as respondent '23'"". Since respondent 23's score is 2, the answer should include 20, 23, 13, 18. But wait, does the task want to include respondent 23 in the list? The example excluded the respondent themselves, but the task here doesn't specify. The example's question was ""excluding the respondent themselves"", but this task doesn't have that instruction. So perhaps the answer should include all, including 23. However, maybe the user expects to exclude 23. Let me check the task again. The task is: ""List all respondents who scored the same on 'Background (history)' as respondent '23'."" So, if the user wants to include 23, then the answer is 20,23,13,18. But maybe the user expects to exclude 23, similar to the example. Wait, the example's answer was ""None"", which suggests that after excluding respondent 19, there were no others. But in the example, the data didn't include respondent 19. Wait, looking back at the example's data, the respondents listed are 20,5,23,13,22,6,18,17,12,8. So respondent 19 isn't in the data. Hence, the answer was ""None"". But in the current task, respondent 23 is in the data. So the answer should include all respondents with score 2, including 23. Unless the task implies to exclude 23. But the task doesn't state that. Therefore, the correct answer is 20,23,13,18. However, I need to check the data again to confirm each respondent's score.

Let me verify each one:

Respondent 20: Background (history): 2 → yes.

Respondent 23: 2 → yes.

Respondent 13: 2 → yes.

Respondent 18: 2 → yes.

Others have 3 or 1 (like respondent 13's examination is 1, but history is 2). So the list is 20,23,13,18. But the task says ""list all respondents"", so including 23. However, in the example, the user excluded the respondent themselves. But since the current task doesn't specify that, perhaps the answer should include all, including 23. Unless there's a standard practice to exclude the self unless told otherwise. But the example's answer was ""None"" because there were no other respondents with the same date as 19. In this case, the answer should include all four. Therefore, the answer is 20,23,13,18.

<task>
List all respondents who scored the same on 'Situation' as respondent '15'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to list all respondents who scored the same on 'Situation' as respondent '15'. 

First, I need to find out what score respondent 15 got for the 'Situation' question. Looking at the responses section, I'll search for Respondent 15. Here's their entry:

Respondent 15:
  Date: 2025-05-04
  SessionName: III - Sepsis
  Identification: 3
  Situation: 3
  Background (history): 2
  Background (examination): 3
  Assessment: 2
  Recommendation (clear recommendation): 2
  Recommendation (global rating scale): 2
  Comments: Detailed Response - clear communication

So, under 'Situation', the score is 3. Now, I need to check all other respondents to see who else has a 'Situation' score of 3. Let's go through each respondent one by one.

Starting with Respondent 14:
- Situation: 3. So that's a match. But wait, the task says to exclude the respondent themselves. Wait, no, the task is to find those who scored the same as respondent 15, not the same date. The example in the problem was about dates, but this task is about the 'Situation' score. So respondent 15's score is 3, so we need all others with 3. But the example had a different exclusion, but here the task doesn't mention excluding respondent 15. Wait, the task says ""list all respondents who scored the same on 'Situation' as respondent '15'."" So including respondent 15? Wait, the example had excluding the respondent themselves, but that was for a different question. Let me check the task again. The task here is to list all respondents with the same 'Situation' score as respondent 15. The example was about dates and excluded the respondent, but this task doesn't specify exclusion. So unless the user wants to exclude respondent 15, but the task doesn't say that. So perhaps we include all, including 15. Wait, but let me check the exact wording. The task is: ""List all respondents who scored the same on 'Situation' as respondent '15'."" So that would include respondent 15 themselves. But maybe the user wants to exclude them? The example had a similar structure where they excluded respondent 19. But in the example, the answer was ""None"" because there were no others. But in this case, perhaps the user expects to include all, including 15. Wait, but let's check the data again.

Looking at the responses:

Respondent 14: Situation: 3
Respondent 12: Situation: 3
Respondent 22: Situation: 3
Respondent 8: Situation: 3
Respondent 15: Situation: 3

Wait, all respondents listed here have a Situation score of 3. Let me confirm each one:

Respondent 14: Situation: 3
Respondent 12: Situation: 3
Respondent 22: Situation: 3
Respondent 8: Situation: 3
Respondent 15: Situation: 3

So all five respondents have a Situation score of 3. Therefore, the answer would be all of them. But the task says ""list all respondents who scored the same on 'Situation' as respondent '15'."" Since respondent 15's score is 3, and all others also have 3, the list would include all respondents. But wait, the example in the problem had a different scenario where the answer was ""None"" because no one else had the same date as respondent 19. But in this case, all respondents have the same Situation score. However, looking back at the provided data in the questionnaire, let me check again to make sure I didn't misread.

Looking at each respondent:

- Respondent 14: Situation: 3
- Respondent 12: Situation: 3
- Respondent 22: Situation: 3
- Respondent 8: Situation: 3
- Respondent 15: Situation: 3

Yes, all have 3. So the answer would be all five respondents. But the output format requires a comma-separated list of their IDs. The respondents are 14, 12, 22, 8, and 15. However, the task doesn't specify whether to include respondent 15 or not. The example excluded the respondent themselves, but that was for a different question. The current task doesn't mention excluding, so perhaps we should include all. But maybe the user expects to exclude respondent 15. Let me check the task again: ""List all respondents who scored the same on 'Situation' as respondent '15'."" The wording is ""who scored the same as"", which could include respondent 15. But sometimes, such questions might want to exclude the reference respondent. However, the example given in the problem had a similar structure where the answer excluded the respondent. Let me check the example again.

In the example, the question was to find respondents with the same date as respondent 19, excluding themselves. The answer was ""None"" because no one else had that date. So in that case, the exclusion was explicit. The current task doesn't mention exclusion, but perhaps the user expects to follow the same logic. Wait, no. The example's exclusion was part of the question, not the answer. The current task doesn't say to exclude respondent 15. Therefore, the answer should include all respondents with the same score, including 15. However, looking at the data provided, all respondents have a Situation score of 3. So the answer would be all of them. But let me check again. Wait, in the provided data, are there any respondents with a different Situation score? Let me check each one again.

Respondent 14: Situation: 3
Respondent 12: Situation: 3
Respondent 22: Situation: 3
Respondent 8: Situation: 3
Respondent 15: Situation: 3

Yes, all have 3. So the answer is all five respondents. But the output should be a comma-separated list of their IDs. So the answer would be ""14, 12, 22, 8, 15"". However, the example's answer was ""None"" when there were no matches. But in this case, all match. So the answer is all five. But wait, the example's data had respondents with different dates. Let me check the example again. In the example, the data included respondents 14, 12, 22, 8, 15. The answer was ""None"" because none had the same date as respondent 19 (but respondent 19 wasn't even in the data, perhaps a typo). Wait, in the example, the data provided didn't include respondent 19, so the answer was ""None"". But in the current task, all respondents have the same Situation score as 15. Therefore, the answer is all of them. But perhaps the user made a mistake in the data entry, but according to the given data, that's the case. So the answer is 14, 12, 22, 8, 15.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents who scored the same on 'Background (examination)' as respondent '22'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The question is asking to list all respondents who scored the same on 'Background (examination)' as respondent '22'. 

First, I need to find out what score respondent 22 has for 'Background (examination)'. Looking at the data provided under Respondent 22, the entry for Background (examination) is 3.

Now, I need to go through each respondent and check their 'Background (examination)' score. Let's list them out:

- Respondent 15: Background (examination) = 3
- Respondent 10: 2
- Respondent 13: 1
- Respondent 17: 3
- Respondent 20: -1
- Respondent 14: 2
- Respondent 6: 3
- Respondent 7: 3
- Respondent 21: 1
- Respondent 22: 3 (target)
- Respondent 3: 3
- Respondent 5: 3

So, the respondents with a score of 3 in 'Background (examination)' are 15, 17, 6, 7, 22, 3, and 5. However, the task says to list all respondents who scored the same as respondent 22, which includes 22, but we need to exclude 22 themselves. Wait, the original example had a task that excluded the respondent themselves, but in this task, the user hasn't specified to exclude respondent 22. Let me check the task again.

The task says: ""List all respondents who scored the same on 'Background (examination)' as respondent '22'."" There's no mention of excluding respondent 22, so we should include them. Wait, but in the example, the user excluded respondent 19. Wait, no, the example was a different question. Let me confirm the current task's exact wording. The current task is to list all respondents with the same score as 22, including 22 unless told otherwise. The example had ""excluding the respondent themselves"", but this task doesn't say that. So, the answer should include all respondents with a score of 3, including 22. But let me check again.

Wait, looking back at the data:

Respondent 22's Background (examination) is 3. So, others with 3 are 15, 17, 6, 7, 3, 5, and 22. So the list would be 3,5,6,7,15,17,22. But the task says ""list all respondents"", so including 22. However, sometimes in such questions, you might exclude the respondent themselves unless specified. But the task here doesn't say to exclude, so I should include them. But let me check the example again. In the example, the user asked to exclude respondent 19. But in this case, the user hasn't specified that. So, the answer should include all, including 22. Wait, but maybe the user made a mistake. Let me check the data again.

Wait, the data for respondent 22 is:

Respondent 22:
  Date: 2025-05-16
  SessionName: IV (VT)
  Identification: 3
  Situation: 3
  Background (history): 3
  Background (examination): 3
  Assessment: 2
  Recommendation (clear recommendation): 2
  Recommendation (global rating scale): 3
  Comments: Clear communication skills
Good

Yes, Background (examination) is 3. So, the respondents with 3 are:

15: 3

17:3

6:3

7:3

3:3

5:3

22:3

So the list is 3,5,6,7,15,17,22. But the task says ""list all respondents"", so all of them. But wait, the example had a similar task where the answer was ""None"", but in that case, maybe there were no others. But here, there are multiple. So the answer should be the list of these respondents. Let me check again each respondent:

Respondent 3: Background (examination):3

Respondent 5:3

Respondent 6:3

Respondent7:3

Respondent15:3

Respondent17:3

Respondent22:3

So the answer is 3,5,6,7,15,17,22. But the output format requires a simple comma-separated list. So the final answer is ""3,5,6,7,15,17,22"".

</output>

<task>
Which respondents participated in the same session name as respondent '23'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find which respondents participated in the same session name as respondent '23'. First, I need to figure out what session name respondent 23 has.

Looking at the data for Respondent 23, the SessionName is listed as ""II-Anaphylaxsis"". Wait, but I notice that the spelling here is ""Anaphylaxsis"" with two 's's. Let me check the other respondents to see if there are similar session names. 

Respondent 12 has SessionName ""II (Anaphylaxis)"", and Respondent 23 has ""II-Anaphylaxsis"". Hmm, ""Anaphylaxsis"" might be a typo for ""Anaphylaxis"". Since the question is about the same session name, I should consider exact matches. But maybe the different formatting (hyphen vs parentheses) and possible typos are just variations. However, the problem might consider them the same. Wait, but the task says ""same session name"", so I need to check exact matches. 

Wait, let me check all SessionNames. Respondent 12: ""II (Anaphylaxis)"", Respondent 23: ""II-Anaphylaxsis"". The spelling difference is between ""Anaphylaxis"" and ""Anaphylaxsis"". That's a typo. But in data analysis, unless specified, we should consider exact matches. However, maybe in the data, ""Anaphylaxsis"" is a misspelling of ""Anaphylaxis"". But the problem doesn't mention handling typos, so I should take the session names as they are. 

Wait, looking at the example provided earlier, in the example, the answer was ""None"" when looking for same date as respondent 19. But in the given data, there's no respondent 19. Wait, the example's data includes respondents up to 23, but the example's answer was ""None"" for respondents with the same date as 19, which isn't present. So perhaps in that case, the answer was none because there was no respondent 19. But in our current task, we have respondent 23. 

So back to the current task. Respondent 23's SessionName is ""II-Anaphylaxsis"". Let's check other respondents:

- Respondent 12: SessionName ""II (Anaphylaxis)""
- Respondent 23: ""II-Anaphylaxsis""
- Others: Respondent 14: IV-Hypoglycemia, Respondent 3: III-Sepsis, Respondent 8: III (Sepsis), Respondent 15: III - Sepsis, Respondent 1: V (Hypoglycemia).

So, the session names for Anaphylaxis-related are Respondent 12 and 23, but their session names are spelled differently. ""Anaphylaxis"" vs ""Anaphylaxsis"". Unless it's a typo, they are different. But perhaps in the data, it's a typo, and they are intended to be the same. However, the problem states to use the data as given. So, if the session names are not exactly the same, they are considered different. 

But let's check the example again. In the example, the task was to find respondents with the same date as respondent 19, which wasn't present, so the answer was None. In the current data, respondent 23's session name is ""II-Anaphylaxsis"". Are there any other respondents with that exact session name? Let's check:

Looking through all SessionNames:

- Respondent 12: II (Anaphylaxis)
- Respondent 23: II-Anaphylaxsis

No other respondents have ""II-Anaphylaxsis"". The others have different session names. So, if we take the session name as exact string match, then only respondent 23 has that session name, so the answer would be none. But wait, maybe the session name is considered the same if the main part is the same, ignoring formatting like hyphens, spaces, or parentheses. For example, ""III-Sepsis"" vs ""III (Sepsis)"" vs ""III - Sepsis"" might be considered the same session name. But in the data, those are different session names. However, the problem might group them. Wait, the task is to find respondents with the same session name as respondent 23. So, respondent 23's session name is ""II-Anaphylaxsis"". Are there any others with that exact name? No. So the answer would be none. But wait, maybe the user intended that ""Anaphylaxsis"" is a typo and should be ""Anaphylaxis"", making respondents 12 and 23 have the same session name. But according to the data as given, they are different. 

Alternatively, perhaps the session name is considered the same if the main part (e.g., ""Anaphylaxis"") is the same, regardless of the prefix (II, III, etc.)? No, the task is to have the same session name. The session name includes the prefix. For example, ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" and ""III-Sepsis"" are different session names. 

Therefore, the only respondent with session name ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" is respondent 23. So, no other respondents have the same session name. Hence, the answer is None.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

List all respondents who scored the same on 'Situation' as respondent '4'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The question is asking to list all respondents who scored the same on 'Situation' as respondent '4'. 

First, I need to find out what respondent 4's 'Situation' score is. Looking at the data under Respondent 4, the 'Situation' is listed as 3. 

Now, I need to go through each respondent and check their 'Situation' scores to see who else has a score of 3. Let's go through each one:

- Respondent 23: Situation is 3. So that's a match.
- Respondent 5: Situation is 3. Another match.
- Respondent 16: Situation is 3. Match.
- Respondent 15: Situation is 3. Match.
- Respondent 1: Situation is 2. Not a match.
- Respondent 3: Situation is 2. No.
- Respondent 19: Situation is 3. Match.
- Respondent 9: Situation is 3. Match.
- Respondent 4: That's the one we're comparing to, so we exclude them from the list as per the task (though the task doesn't say to exclude, but the example did. Wait, the task here is different. The example was about same date, but this task is same score. The task says ""excluding the respondent themselves"" in the example, but the current task doesn't mention exclusion. Wait, no, the current task is ""List all respondents who scored the same on 'Situation' as respondent '4'."" So we include respondent 4 only if others have the same score. Wait, but the example had a similar structure where they excluded respondent 19. But in this case, the task doesn't specify to exclude respondent 4. Wait, the user's task here is different. Let me check again.

The task is: ""List all respondents who scored the same on 'Situation' as respondent '4'."" So we need to include all respondents (including 4?) or exclude 4? The example in the initial problem excluded the respondent themselves, but that was for a different question. The current task doesn't specify exclusion. However, in data analysis, when someone asks for others with the same score, sometimes they might want to exclude the original, but unless specified, perhaps include all. But the example's answer was ""None"" which might be a red herring. Wait, in the example, the answer was ""None"" because there were no other respondents on the same date as 19. Let me check the data again.

Looking at the data for respondent 4: Date is 2025-05-16. Let's see if others have that date. Respondent 19's date is 2025-05-16, and respondent 21's date is also 2025-05-16, and respondent 4's date is 2025-05-16. So in the example, the answer was ""None"" but that's incorrect. Wait, the example's answer was ""None"" but according to the data, respondents 4, 19, and 21 have the same date as 19. But the example's answer was ""None"". Hmm, maybe the example was a mistake. But in any case, the current task is different.

Back to the current task: Find all respondents with the same 'Situation' score as respondent 4. Respondent 4's 'Situation' is 3. So we need to list all respondents with 'Situation' 3. Let's check each:

Respondent 23: 3 → include
Respondent 5: 3 → include
Respondent 16: 3 → include
Respondent 15: 3 → include
Respondent 19: 3 → include
Respondent 9: 3 → include
Respondent 4: 3 → include? The task says ""all respondents who scored the same"", so unless told to exclude, we include. But sometimes, in such questions, they might want to exclude the original, but the task here doesn't specify that. So according to the data, the answer would be 23,5,16,15,19,9,4. But let's check each entry again.

Wait, let's go through each respondent's 'Situation' score:

- 23: 3
- 5: 3
- 16: 3
- 15: 3
- 1: 2
- 3: 2
- 19: 3
- 9: 3
- 4: 3
- 14: 3
- 18: 3
- 21: 2

Wait, wait, I think I missed some respondents. Let me recount all the respondents listed:

The respondents are: 23,5,16,15,1,3,19,9,4,14,18,21.

Now, checking each:

- 23: Situation 3
- 5: 3
- 16:3
- 15:3
- 1:2
- 3:2
- 19:3
- 9:3
- 4:3
- 14:3 (Wait, respondent 14's Situation is 3? Let me check. Yes, under Respondent 14: Situation:3)
- 18:3 (Respondent 18's Situation is 3)
- 21:2

So respondents with Situation 3 are: 23,5,16,15,19,9,4,14,18. That's 9 respondents. But wait, the original data for each:

Respondent 14: Situation:3
Respondent 18: Situation:3

So adding those, the list is longer. So the answer should include all these. But the task is to list all respondents who scored the same as respondent 4, which is 3. So the answer is 23,5,16,15,19,9,4,14,18. But let me check each again to be sure.

Yes:

- 23:3
-5:3
-16:3
-15:3
-19:3
-9:3
-4:3
-14:3
-18:3

That's 9 respondents. So the answer should be a comma-separated list of these numbers: 23,5,16,15,19,9,4,14,18.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents who scored the same on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' as respondent '12' and also scored perfectly on 'Background (examination)'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The goal is to find all respondents who scored the same as respondent 12 on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and also have a perfect score on 'Background (examination)'. 

First, I need to find out what respondent 12's score is for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)'. Looking at the data for respondent 12, under that category, the score is 3. 

Next, I need to check the 'Background (examination)' scores for all respondents. A perfect score here is 3, as per the rubric. 

Now, I'll go through each respondent and check these two conditions. Let's list them out:

- Respondent 3: 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' is 3. 'Background (examination)' is 3. So this one meets both conditions.
- Respondent 4: Recommendation score is 2. Background exam is 2. Doesn't match.
- Respondent 16: Recommendation is 2. Background exam is 3. So recommendation doesn't match 12's 3.
- Respondent 20: Recommendation is 2. Background exam is -1. Nope.
- Respondent 18: Recommendation is 2. Background exam is 2. No.
- Respondent 1: Recommendation is 2. Background exam is 2. No.
- Respondent 17: Recommendation is 3. Background exam is 3. This fits.
- Respondent 8: Recommendation is 2. Background exam is 2. No.
- Respondent 12: They are the reference, so we exclude them? Wait, the task says ""all respondents"" but doesn't mention excluding 12. Wait, the task says ""list all respondents who scored the same... as respondent '12'"", so including 12? But let me check. The example in the problem had to exclude the respondent themselves, but in this task, there's no such instruction. Wait, the example was about dates, but here it's about scores. The task here doesn't say to exclude respondent 12. So if 12 meets both conditions, they should be included. Let me check respondent 12's Background (examination): it's 3. And their Recommendation is 3. So they do meet both. But wait, the task says ""also scored perfectly on 'Background (examination)'"", which is 3. So respondent 12 would be included. But wait, the example in the problem had to exclude the respondent themselves, but in this case, the task doesn't specify that. So I need to check if the task wants to include respondent 12 or not. The task says ""all respondents who..."", so unless told to exclude, we include. So respondent 12 is a candidate. But wait, let me check the data again. Respondent 12's 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' is 3, same as themselves, and 'Background (examination)' is 3. So they meet the criteria. But maybe the task expects to exclude them? Wait, the original example excluded the respondent themselves, but that was because the question was about the same date as respondent 19, excluding themselves. Here, the task doesn't mention excluding, so perhaps we include. Hmm. But let's check the data again. The task is to list all respondents who scored the same on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' as respondent 12 and also scored perfectly on 'Background (examination)'. So if respondent 12 meets both, they should be included. Let's proceed.

Continuing:

- Respondent 23: Recommendation is 3. Background exam is 2. So no.
- Respondent 5: Recommendation is 2. Background exam is 3. So recommendation doesn't match.
- Respondent 7: Recommendation is 2. Background exam is 3. No.

So the respondents meeting both conditions are:

- Respondent 3: Both 3 in Recommendation and 3 in Background exam.
- Respondent 17: Both 3.
- Respondent 12: Both 3.

Wait, but the example in the problem had an answer of ""None"", but that was a different question. Here, according to the data, these three respondents meet the criteria. But wait, let me double-check:

Respondent 3: 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' is 3, same as 12. 'Background (examination)' is 3. So yes.

Respondent 17: 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' is 3. 'Background (examination)' is 3. So yes.

Respondent 12: Their own 'Recommendation' is 3, and 'Background (examination)' is 3. So yes.

So the answer should be respondents 3, 12, 17. But wait, let me check again. The task says ""list all respondents who scored the same on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' as respondent '12' and also scored perfectly on 'Background (examination)'.""

So same as respondent 12's score in recommendation (which is 3) and perfect in background exam (3). So yes, those three. But wait, in the data, respondent 3's 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' is 3, and 'Background (examination)' is 3. So included. Respondent 12 is included. Respondent 17: same. So the answer is 3, 12, 17. But let me check again.

Wait, respondent 3's 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' is 3. Yes. Background exam is 3. So included. Respondent 12: same. Respondent 17: same. So three respondents. But wait, looking back at the data:

Respondent 3:

Recommendation (clear recommendation): 3

Background (examination): 3

Yes.

Respondent 12:

Recommendation (clear recommendation): 3

Background (examination): 3

Yes.

Respondent 17:

Recommendation (clear recommendation): 3

Background (examination): 3

Yes.

So the answer should be 3, 12, 17. But wait, the example in the problem had an answer of ""None"", but that's a different scenario. Here, according to the data, these three meet the criteria. However, I need to check if the task wants to include respondent 12. The task says ""all respondents"", so unless told to exclude, they should be included. So the answer is 3, 12, 17.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The goal is to find all respondents who participated in the same session name as respondent '12' and whose comments include the word 'Good'. 

First, I need to determine what session name respondent 12 has. Looking at the data under Respondent 12, the SessionName is listed as ""II (Anaphylaxis)"". So the session name here is ""II (Anaphylaxis)"". 

Now, I need to find all other respondents who have the same session name. But I should also check for possible variations in the session name spelling. For example, sometimes there might be typos or different formatting. Let's look through each respondent's SessionName:

- Respondent 1: V (Hypoglycemia) – not a match.
- Respondent 12: II (Anaphylaxis) – our target.
- Respondent 3: III-Sepsis – different.
- Respondent 22: IV (VT) – nope.
- Respondent 8: III (Sepsis) – no.
- Respondent 4: III (Sepsis) – no.
- Respondent 11: IV (AF) – different.
- Respondent 5: II - Anaphylaxsis – Hmm, ""Anaphylaxsis"" might be a typo for Anaphylaxis. The session name here is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"". The roman numeral II matches, and the condition seems similar. So this could be a variation.
- Respondent 23: II-Anaphylaxsis – Again, II matches, and the condition is Anaphylaxsis. Another possible variation.
- Respondent 6: II (Anaphylactic Shock) – The roman numeral II is there, but the condition is Anaphylactic Shock. This might be a different session, but maybe it's considered the same? Wait, the original session for respondent 12 is Anaphylaxis. Anaphylactic Shock is a severe form of anaphylaxis, but the session names might be different. However, the task is to match the exact session name. So ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"" is different from ""II (Anaphylaxis)"", so probably not a match. But I need to check if the system considers these the same. Since the data shows different names, I should treat them as different unless specified otherwise. So respondent 6's session is different.

So possible matches for the session name ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" are respondents 12, 5, and 23, assuming that ""Anaphylaxsis"" is a typo. But the task says ""same session name"", so we need exact matches. Wait, the session names for 5 and 23 are ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" and ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" respectively. The original is ""II (Anaphylaxis)"". The spelling of the condition is different (Anaphylaxsis vs Anaphylaxis). Are these considered the same? The user might consider them the same if it's a typo, but according to the data, they are different session names. For example, respondent 5's SessionName is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" with a hyphen and a different spelling. Similarly, respondent 23's is ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" with a hyphen and the same spelling as 5. So unless the task considers these as the same session despite the spelling difference, they might not be included. However, the task says ""same session name"", so exact match is required. Therefore, only respondent 12's session name is ""II (Anaphylaxis)"", and others have variations. Wait, but maybe the session name is considered the same if the roman numeral is II and the condition is Anaphylaxis, regardless of formatting. For example, ""II (Anaphylaxis)"", ""II - Anaphylaxsis"", ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" – perhaps these are all variations of the same session. But the problem is that the exact session name is different. The task says ""same session name"", so unless the user considers different spellings as the same, we have to go by exact string match. However, in the data, respondent 5's SessionName is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"", which is different from ""II (Anaphylaxis)"". So perhaps the correct approach is to look for any session name that starts with ""II"" and refers to Anaphylaxis, even with different formatting. But the problem is that the exact session name is required. Let me check the data again. 

Looking at the example provided in the initial part: in the example, the answer was ""None"" because the user was looking for respondents with the same date as respondent 19, but in the data provided, there was no respondent 19. Wait, in the example, the answer was ""None"" because the data didn't have respondent 19. But in our current task, we have respondent 12. 

Back to the task: Find respondents with the same session name as respondent 12. Respondent 12's session name is ""II (Anaphylaxis)"". So we need to find all other respondents where SessionName is exactly ""II (Anaphylaxis)"". But looking at the data, no other respondents have that exact string. Respondent 5 has ""II - Anaphylaxsis"", 23 has ""II-Anaphylaxsis"", and 6 has ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"". So none of these are exact matches. Therefore, the answer would be none. But that seems unlikely. Maybe the session name is considered the same if the roman numeral and the condition are the same, even with different punctuation or spelling. For example, ""Anaphylaxis"" vs ""Anaphylaxsis"" – perhaps a typo. If that's the case, then respondents 5, 23, and 12 would be considered as having the same session name. But how to determine that? The task says ""same session name"", so unless the data indicates that these are considered the same, we have to treat them as different. 

Alternatively, maybe the session name is determined by the roman numeral part. For example, session II, regardless of the condition. But the session name includes both the numeral and the condition. For example, ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" is a specific session. If another respondent has ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"", that's a different session name. Therefore, in the data provided, only respondent 12 has ""II (Anaphylaxis)"", and others have variations. Therefore, there are no other respondents with the exact same session name. But that can't be right. Let me check again. 

Wait, looking at the data again:

Respondent 12: SessionName: II (Anaphylaxis)
Respondent 5: SessionName: II - Anaphylaxsis
Respondent 23: SessionName: II-Anaphylaxsis
Respondent 6: SessionName: II (Anaphylactic Shock)

So the roman numeral is II for all, but the conditions are Anaphylaxis, Anaphylaxsis (probably a typo), and Anaphylactic Shock. If the task is looking for the same session name, then only exact matches count. Therefore, only respondent 12 has that exact session name. However, if the session name is considered the same if the numeral is II and the condition is a variation of Anaphylaxis, then 5 and 23 might be included. But the problem is that the task says ""same session name"", which implies exact string match. Therefore, unless the data has other respondents with ""II (Anaphylaxis)"", there are none. 

But wait, looking at the data again, perhaps I missed someone. Let me list all respondents:

Respondent 1: V (Hypoglycemia)
12: II (Anaphylaxis)
3: III-Sepsis
22: IV (VT)
8: III (Sepsis)
4: III (Sepsis)
11: IV (AF)
5: II - Anaphylaxsis
23: II-Anaphylaxsis
6: II (Anaphylactic Shock)

So only respondent 12 has ""II (Anaphylaxis)"". The others with II are 5, 23, and 6, but their session names are different. Therefore, the first part of the task (same session name as respondent 12) would only include respondent 12 themselves. But the task says to exclude the respondent themselves. Wait, the task says ""excluding the respondent themselves"" – but in the example, the user was looking for same date as respondent 19, which wasn't present. In our current task, the instruction is to find respondents who participated in the same session name as respondent '12' and whose comments contain 'Good'. So first, find respondents with the same session name as 12 (which is ""II (Anaphylaxis)""), then check if their comments include 'Good'. But if no one else has that exact session name, then the answer is none. However, perhaps the session name variations are considered the same. For example, ""II (Anaphylaxis)"", ""II - Anaphylaxsis"", ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" – maybe these are all considered the same session name, just with typos. If that's the case, then respondents 5, 23, and 12 are in the same session. But since we need to exclude respondent 12, we look at 5 and 23. Then check their comments for 'Good'. 

Looking at respondent 5's comments: ""Good clear and precise clinical handover Good"". So 'Good' is present. Respondent 23's comments: ""Talking to registrav could not summarize the condition of patient very clearly DID: Sepsis I Anaphylaxsis given by team"" – no 'Good' here. Respondent 6's session name is different. So if we consider 5's session name as matching, then respondent 5 would be included. But if the session names must be exact, then only respondent 12, and excluding themselves, no one else. 

This is a bit ambiguous. The task says ""same session name"". The data shows that respondent 12's session name is ""II (Anaphylaxis)"", while others have variations. However, in real-world data, such typos or formatting differences might be considered the same session. For example, ""Anaphylaxis"" vs ""Anaphylaxsis"" could be a typo. Similarly, the hyphen vs parentheses in the session name. If we consider that the session name is ""II"" with Anaphylaxis (regardless of formatting), then respondents 5 and 23 would be included. But according to the data, the session names are different. 

Alternatively, perhaps the SessionName is case-insensitive or allows for minor variations. But the task instructions say to use the data as given. Therefore, unless the session names are exactly the same, they are considered different. 

In that case, there are no other respondents with the exact session name as respondent 12. Therefore, the answer would be none. But that seems counterintuitive. Alternatively, maybe the session name is determined by the numeral part. For example, all sessions with ""II"" regardless of the condition. But the session name includes both the numeral and the condition. For example, ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" is a specific session, while ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"" is another. Therefore, the answer would be that there are no other respondents with the same session name as 12. 

But wait, looking back at the example given in the problem statement, the answer was ""None"" because there was no respondent 19. But in our case, respondent 12 exists. However, if no one else has the same session name, then the answer is none. 

Alternatively, perhaps the session name is considered the same if the numeral is the same. For example, all sessions with ""II"" in their name. If that's the case, then respondents 5, 23, 6, and 12 have session names starting with ""II"". Then, among these, we need to check comments for 'Good'. 

But the task says ""same session name"", not ""same session numeral"". The session name includes both the numeral and the condition. Therefore, unless the entire string matches, they are different. 

Given that, the only respondent with the exact session name ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" is respondent 12. Excluding themselves, there are no others. Therefore, the answer is none. But wait, let's check the comments of respondent 12. Their comments are ""Good"". So if we include respondent 12, but the task says to exclude the respondent themselves. Wait, the task says ""excluding the respondent themselves"" – but in the example, the user was looking for others on the same date as respondent 19, excluding themselves. In our current task, the instruction is to find respondents who participated in the same session name as respondent '12' and whose comments contain 'Good'. So we need to exclude respondent 12. 

But if no one else has the same session name, then the answer is none. However, if we consider the session names with variations as the same, then respondents 5 and 23 would be considered. Let's check their comments. 

Respondent 5's comments: ""Good clear and precise clinical handover Good"" – contains 'Good' twice. So if their session name is considered the same as 12's, then they would be included. 

Respondent 23's comments: No 'Good' mentioned. 

Respondent 6's session name is different. 

So if session name variations are allowed, then respondent 5 is the answer. But if exact match is required, then no one. 

The problem is that the task's phrasing is ambiguous. However, based on the data as given, the session names are different. Therefore, the answer is none. But this seems counterintuitive. Alternatively, perhaps the session name is considered the same if the numeral matches. For example, all sessions with ""II"" in the name. Then, respondents 5, 23, 6, and 12. Excluding 12, check 5, 23, 6. 

Respondent 5's comments have 'Good'. 

Respondent 23's comments do not. 

Respondent 6's comments are empty. 

So in that case, the answer would be respondent 5. 

But the session name for respondent 5 is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"", which is different from ""II (Anaphylaxis)"". So unless the task considers the numeral part only, which is not specified, we can't assume that. 

The task says ""same session name"", which implies the entire name. Therefore, the answer is none. But this seems odd. Alternatively, perhaps the session name is considered the same if the numeral and the condition are the same, regardless of formatting. For example, ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" and ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" might be considered the same session, with a typo in the condition name. In that case, respondents 12, 5, and 23 are in the same session. Excluding 12, check 5 and 23. 

Respondent 5's comments have 'Good', so they would be included. 

Respondent 23's comments do not. 

Therefore, the answer would be respondent 5. 

But how to determine if the session names are considered the same despite the typo? The data does not provide any indication that these are the same session. Therefore, the safest approach is to treat them as different. 

However, in real-world scenarios, such typos are common, and the user might expect that. But according to the problem's instructions, we must base our analysis solely on the provided data. Since the session names are different, we can't assume they are the same. 

Therefore, the answer is that there are no respondents other than 12 with the exact session name ""II (Anaphylaxis)"", and thus none that meet the criteria. 

But wait, looking back at the data, respondent 5's SessionName is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"". The hyphen and the extra 's' in Anaphylaxsis might be a typo. If we consider that Anaphylaxsis is a misspelling of Anaphylaxis, then the session name is intended to be the same. In that case, respondent 5 would be included. 

This is a judgment call. Since the task is to find respondents with the same session name, and the names are slightly different, but possibly intended to be the same, the answer might be respondent 5. 

But according to strict data matching, the answer is none. However, given that the example in the problem had an answer of ""None"" because respondent 19 wasn't present, but in this case, respondent 12 exists, but no others with the exact session name. 

Alternatively, perhaps the session name is case-insensitive or allows for different punctuation. For example, ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" vs ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" – the difference is the punctuation and the spelling. If we ignore punctuation and case, then ""II Anaphylaxis"" vs ""II Anaphylaxsis"" – the spelling difference remains. 

In medical terms, ""Anaphylaxis"" is the correct term, while ""Anaphylaxsis"" is a common misspelling. Therefore, it's possible that these are intended to be the same session. 

Given that, the answer would include respondent 5. 

But the problem is that the task requires us to use the data as given. Therefore, unless the session names are exactly the same, they are different. 

In conclusion, based on strict data matching, there are no other respondents with the exact session name as respondent 12. Therefore, the answer is none. However, if we consider possible typos, the answer would be respondent 5. 

But the example in the problem shows that the answer was ""None"" when the respondent wasn't present. Here, respondent 12 exists, but no others with the same session name. Therefore, the answer is none. 

Wait, but respondent 5's comments include 'Good', and if their session name is considered the same as 12's, then they would be the answer. But according to the data, the session names are different. 

This is a tricky situation. The correct approach is to follow the data as given. Therefore, the answer is none. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the session name is considered the same if the numeral is II, regardless of the rest. For example, all sessions with ""II"" in the name. Then, respondents 5, 23, 6, and 12. Excluding 12, check the others. 

Respondent 5: comments have 'Good' – included. 

Respondent 23: no 'Good' – excluded. 

Respondent 6: no 'Good' – excluded. 

So the answer would be respondent 5. 

But the session name for 5 is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"", which is different from 12's ""II (Anaphylaxis)"". 

The task says ""same session name"", which implies the entire name. Therefore",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' is higher than the average 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' for all sessions that happened on the same date as respondent '16's session.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find all respondents whose 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' score is higher than the average of that same metric for all sessions that occurred on the same date as respondent 16's session. 

First, I need to determine the date of respondent 16's session. Looking at the data for respondent 16, the Date is listed as 2025-05-02. 

Next, I need to find all other respondents who had sessions on 2025-05-02. From the responses, let's check each respondent's Date:

- Respondent 8: 2025-05-02
- Respondent 1: 2025-05-02
- Respondent 16: 2025-05-02 (but we'll exclude this one since we're looking for others on the same date)
- Respondent 16 is the one we're using as the reference, so we need to exclude them from the average calculation.

So the respondents on 2025-05-02 are 8, 1, and 16. Excluding 16, that leaves respondents 8 and 1.

Now, calculate the average 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' score for these two. 

Respondent 8's score: 2
Respondent 1's score: 2

Average = (2 + 2) / 2 = 2

Now, we need to find all respondents (across all dates) where their 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' score is higher than this average of 2. 

Looking through all respondents:

- Respondent 21: 3 (higher than 2)
- Respondent 9: 3 (higher than 2)
- Respondent 8: 2 (not higher)
- Respondent 4: 2 (not higher)
- Respondent 1: 2 (not higher)
- Respondent 6: 2 (not higher)
- Respondent 16: 2 (not higher)
- Respondent 13: 2 (not higher)
- Respondent 15: 2 (not higher)
- Respondent 22: 2 (not higher)

So the respondents with scores higher than 2 are 21 and 9. 

Therefore, the answer should be respondents 21 and 9.

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
