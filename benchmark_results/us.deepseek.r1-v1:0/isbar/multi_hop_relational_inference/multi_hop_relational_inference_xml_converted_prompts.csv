<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondents participated in the same session name as respondent '9'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find which respondents participated in the same session name as respondent '9'. First, I need to look at the data provided in the XML format.

First, I'll locate respondent '9' in the responses section. Let me scan through the respondents until I find the one with id=""9"". Here it is:

<respondent id=""9"">
  <answer question=""Date"">2025-05-04</answer>
  <answer question=""SessionName"">II (Anaphylaxsis)</answer>
  ...
</respondent>

So, the session name for respondent 9 is ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"". Now, I need to find all other respondents who have the same session name. But I have to be careful about the exact spelling and formatting of the session name. Let's check each respondent's SessionName answer.

Looking at the other respondents:

- Respondent 12: SessionName is ""II (Anaphylaxis)"". The spelling here is ""Anaphylaxis"" with an 'i', whereas respondent 9 has ""Anaphylaxsis"" with double 's'. Wait, that's a possible typo. But in the data, respondent 5 has ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" and respondent 9 has ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"". So maybe ""Anaphylaxsis"" is a typo for ""Anaphylaxis"", but the data shows different spellings. However, since the task is to match exactly, I should consider the exact string.

Wait, let me check again. Respondent 5's SessionName is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" (with a hyphen and double 's'), and respondent 9's is ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"" (with parentheses and double 's'). So the exact session names are:

- Respondent 5: ""II - Anaphylaxsis""
- Respondent 9: ""II (Anaphylaxsis)""
- Respondent 12: ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" (with single 's')

So, are these considered the same session name? The problem is that the session names have slight variations in punctuation and spelling. For example, ""Anaphylaxsis"" vs. ""Anaphylaxis"". But according to the data, these are different session names. However, maybe the user considers them the same despite the typo. But according to the instructions, I should base my analysis strictly on the provided data. So if the session names are different in the data, they are considered different.

Wait, but looking at respondent 5 and 9, their session names are ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" and ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"" respectively. The difference is the separator between ""II"" and the name: hyphen vs. parentheses. The actual session name part is ""Anaphylaxsis"" for both. However, the full session name includes the separator. So ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" and ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"" would be different session names. Similarly, respondent 12's session name is ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" which is a different spelling (single 's').

But wait, maybe ""Anaphylaxsis"" is a typo for ""Anaphylaxis"". But the data shows that respondent 5 and 9 have ""Anaphylaxsis"" with double 's', while respondent 12 has ""Anaphylaxis"" with single 's'. So according to the data, these are different session names. Therefore, the only respondents with the exact same session name as respondent 9 are those who have ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"".

Looking through the data again:

- Respondent 5: ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" (different separator)
- Respondent 9: ""II (Anaphylaxsis)""
- Respondent 12: ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" (different spelling)
- Are there any others?

Looking at all respondents:

Respondent 3: III-Sepsis
Respondent 4: III (Sepsis)
Respondent 7: III-Sepsis
Respondent 8: III (Sepsis)
Respondent 10: (MI)-VT
Respondent 21: I (Myocardial infarction)
Respondent 22: IV (VT)

So, the only other respondent with a session name that includes ""Anaphylaxsis"" is respondent 5, but their session name is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" with a hyphen, whereas respondent 9's is ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"". Since the separator is different, they are considered different session names. Therefore, respondent 9 is the only one with that exact session name. Wait, but maybe the user considers ""II"" followed by the same condition, regardless of punctuation. But according to the data, the session names are as written, so exact matches are required.

Alternatively, perhaps ""Anaphylaxsis"" is a typo and should be considered the same as ""Anaphylaxis"". But the data shows both spellings. For example, respondent 5 and 9 have ""Anaphylaxsis"", while 12 has ""Anaphylaxis"". So unless instructed otherwise, we must treat them as different.

Therefore, the answer would be that no other respondents have the exact same session name as respondent 9. But wait, let me check again. Respondent 9's session name is ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"". Are there any other respondents with that exact string?

Looking at respondent 5: ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" (hyphen instead of parentheses)
Respondent 12: ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" (different spelling)
So no, there are no other respondents with the exact same session name as respondent 9. Therefore, the answer is none.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify Respondent 9's Session Name:**
   - Respondent 9's `SessionName` is ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"".

2. **Search for Matching Session Names:**
   - **Respondent 5:** ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" (same condition name but different separator, hyphen vs. parentheses).
   - **Respondent 12:** ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" (different spelling: single 's' in ""Anaphylaxis"" vs. double 'ss' in ""Anaphylaxsis"").

3. **Conclusion:**
   - No exact matches for ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"" exist except respondent 9. However, respondent 5's session name is considered a match if minor formatting differences (hyphen vs. parentheses) are ignored, which is a common data interpretation. Thus, respondents **5 and 9** are grouped under the same session name.",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondents participated in the same session name as respondent '9'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find which respondents participated in the same session name as respondent '9'. First, I need to look at the data provided for respondent '9' to determine their session name.

Looking at the responses section, I'll search for the respondent with id=""9"". Here's the entry for respondent 9:

<respondent id=""9"">
  <answer question=""Date"">2025-05-04</answer>
  <answer question=""SessionName"">II (Anaphylaxsis)</answer>
  ...
</respondent>

So, the session name for respondent 9 is ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"". Now, I need to find all other respondents who have the same session name. But wait, I should check if there are variations in how the session name is written. For example, sometimes there might be hyphens, spaces, or different parentheses. Let me check all the session names in the data.

Looking through each respondent's SessionName:

- Respondent 5: ""II - Anaphylaxsis""
- Respondent 15: ""III - Sepsis""
- Respondent 3: ""III-Sepsis""
- Respondent 16: ""I - MI""
- Respondent 22: ""IV (VT)""
- Respondent 10: ""(MI)-VT""
- Respondent 9: ""II (Anaphylaxsis)""
- Respondent 2: ""MI""
- Respondent 6: ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)""
- Respondent 17: ""V (Hypoglycemia)""

Now, comparing these to respondent 9's session name ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"", I need to see if any others match exactly or if there are typos or variations. 

Looking at respondent 5: Their session name is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"". The difference here is the hyphen and space instead of parentheses. However, the core part ""II"" and ""Anaphylaxsis"" (which might be a typo for Anaphylaxis) is similar. But the formatting is different. The problem is whether the session name is considered the same despite formatting differences. The question is about the same session name, so exact string match is required unless specified otherwise. Since the task is to find the same session name, I should look for exact matches. 

Wait, respondent 5's SessionName is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" and respondent 9's is ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"". The difference is the separator between II and Anaphylaxsis: hyphen vs. parentheses. So unless these are considered the same, they are different. But the names are not exactly the same. However, maybe ""Anaphylaxsis"" is a typo for ""Anaphylaxis"", but the data shows ""Anaphylaxsis"" in both cases. So the session names are ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" and ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"", which are different. Therefore, respondent 5's session name is not the same as respondent 9's.

Looking at respondent 6: Their session name is ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"". This is different from ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"", so they are not the same.

No other respondents have ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"" as their session name. Therefore, the only respondent with that exact session name is respondent 9 themselves. The task asks for other respondents who participated in the same session name, excluding themselves. Therefore, there are no other respondents with the same session name as respondent 9.

Wait, but let me double-check. Are there any other respondents with ""II (Anaphylaxsis)""? Let me scan again:

Respondent 5: ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" (different)
Respondent 9: ""II (Anaphylaxsis)""
No others. So the answer should be none. But wait, maybe the session name is considered the same if the main part is the same, but according to the data, the session names are written differently. The problem states ""same session name"", so exact match is required. Therefore, the answer is that there are no other respondents with the same session name as respondent 9.

5, 9, 17

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**
1. **Identify Respondent 9's Session Name:** Respondent '9' has the SessionName ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"".
2. **Check All Respondents for Matching SessionName:**
   - Respondent 5: ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" (hyphen format variation)
   - Respondent 9: ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"" (exact match, but excluded as per the task)
   - Respondent 17: ""V (Hypoglycemia)"" (no match)
   - **No exact matches** for ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"" except respondent 9.

**Answer:** None",False

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
List all respondents who scored the same on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' as respondent '15'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to list all respondents who scored the same on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' as respondent '15'. 

First, I need to find out what score respondent 15 has for that question. Looking at the responses section, I'll search for the respondent with id=""15"". 

Here's the entry for respondent 15:
<respondent id=""15"">
  ...
  <answer question=""Recommendation (clear recommendation)"">2</answer>
  ...
</respondent>

So, respondent 15 has a score of 2 for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)'. 

Next, I need to check all other respondents to see who else has a score of 2 in that same question. Let's go through each respondent one by one.

- Respondent 3: <answer question=""Recommendation (clear recommendation)"">3</answer> → Score 3. Doesn't match.
- Respondent 21: <answer question=""Recommendation (clear recommendation)"">3</answer> → Score 3. Doesn't match.
- Respondent 23: <answer question=""Recommendation (clear recommendation)"">3</answer> → Score 3. Doesn't match.
- Respondent 20: <answer question=""Recommendation (clear recommendation)"">2</answer> → Score 2. Matches.
- Respondent 17: <answer question=""Recommendation (clear recommendation)"">3</answer> → Score 3. Doesn't match.
- Respondent 13: <answer question=""Recommendation (clear recommendation)"">2</answer> → Score 2. Matches.
- Respondent 2: <answer question=""Recommendation (clear recommendation)"">2</answer> → Score 2. Matches.
- Respondent 8: <answer question=""Recommendation (clear recommendation)"">2</answer> → Score 2. Matches.

Wait, but the task says to list all respondents who scored the same as respondent 15, excluding themselves. So we need to exclude respondent 15 from the list. Let's check the respondents again:

- Respondent 20: Score 2 → Include.
- Respondent 13: Score 2 → Include.
- Respondent 2: Score 2 → Include.
- Respondent 8: Score 2 → Include.

So the respondents with the same score (2) as respondent 15 are 20, 13, 2, and 8. 

I should verify each of these to ensure there are no mistakes. Let me double-check each one:

- Respondent 20: Yes, score 2.
- Respondent 13: Yes, score 2.
- Respondent 2: Yes, score 2.
- Respondent 8: Yes, score 2.

No other respondents have a score of 2. Therefore, the answer should be these four respondents, listed as a comma-separated list of their IDs.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondents participated in the same session name as respondent '2'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find which respondents participated in the same session name as respondent '2'. First, I need to understand the data structure provided.

Looking at the XML data, each respondent has an 'id' and various answers to questions. The key here is the 'SessionName' question. So, the plan is:

1. **Find the SessionName of respondent '2'**: Check the responses for respondent id=""2"" and note their answer to the 'SessionName' question.
2. **Compare with other respondents**: Look through all other respondents to see who has the same SessionName value.
3. **Exclude respondent '2' themselves**: Since the question asks for others who participated in the same session, we need to exclude respondent '2' from the results.

Starting with step 1, I'll look for respondent '2' in the responses. Here's the entry:

<respondent id=""2"">
  <answer question=""Date"">2025-04-04</answer>
  <answer question=""SessionName"">MI</answer>
  ...
</respondent>

So, the SessionName for respondent '2' is ""MI"".

Next, step 2: Check all other respondents' SessionName answers. Let's go through each one:

- **Respondent 23**: SessionName is ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" – different.
- **Respondent 3**: ""III-Sepsis"" – different.
- **Respondent 17**: ""V (Hypoglycemia)"" – different.
- **Respondent 6**: ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"" – different.
- **Respondent 8**: ""III (Sepsis)"" – different.
- **Respondent 15**: ""III - Sepsis"" – different.
- **Respondent 21**: ""I (Myocardial infarction)"" – Hmm, ""MI"" stands for Myocardial Infarction. But the SessionName here is written as ""I (Myocardial infarction)"". Wait, respondent '2' has ""MI"" as SessionName. Are these considered the same? The problem is whether ""MI"" and ""I (Myocardial infarction)"" are the same session. The SessionName for respondent '21' is ""I (Myocardial infarction)"", which might be the same as ""MI"" if ""I"" refers to the same thing. But the naming isn't consistent. Alternatively, maybe ""MI"" is an abbreviation. However, in the data, respondent '16' has SessionName ""I - MI"", which combines both. Let's check that.

- **Respondent 16**: SessionName is ""I - MI"". So, this seems to combine the Roman numeral I with ""MI"". But respondent '2' has just ""MI"". Are these considered the same session name? The problem is that the SessionName is a free-text field, so exact match is required unless specified otherwise. Since the task is to find the same session name, we need exact matches. 

Wait, looking back at respondent '21': their SessionName is ""I (Myocardial infarction)"", which is different from ""MI"". Respondent '16' has ""I - MI"", which includes ""MI"" but isn't exactly ""MI"". Respondent '2' has ""MI"" alone. So, unless ""MI"" is an abbreviation that's considered equivalent to ""Myocardial infarction"" in the SessionName, but according to the data, the SessionNames are as entered. Since the question is about the same SessionName, we need exact string matches. Therefore, only respondents with SessionName exactly ""MI"" would be considered. 

Looking through all respondents again:

- Respondent '2': ""MI""
- Any others? Let's check again:

- Respondent '16': ""I - MI"" – not exact.
- Respondent '21': ""I (Myocardial infarction)"" – not exact.
- Any others? Let's check all:

- Respondent '23': II-Anaphylaxsis
- '3': III-Sepsis
- '17': V (Hypoglycemia)
- '6': II (Anaphylactic Shock)
- '8': III (Sepsis)
- '15': III - Sepsis
- '21': I (Myocardial infarction)
- '9': II (Anaphylaxsis)
- '16': I - MI

No other respondent has the exact SessionName ""MI"" except respondent '2' themselves. Therefore, there are no other respondents with the same SessionName as '2'. The answer should be none, but let me double-check to ensure I didn't miss any.

Wait, perhaps ""MI"" is a shorthand, but according to the data, the SessionName is exactly as written. For example, respondent '16' has ""I - MI"", which includes ""MI"" but isn't the same as ""MI"". Similarly, respondent '21' has ""I (Myocardial infarction)"", which is a longer form. Since the problem requires the same SessionName, exact match is needed. Therefore, no other respondents have ""MI"" as their SessionName. Hence, the answer is none.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents who scored the same on 'Background (history)' as respondent '13'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to list all respondents who scored the same on 'Background (history)' as respondent '13'. 

First, I need to find out what score respondent '13' received for 'Background (history)'. Looking at the responses section, I'll search for the respondent with id=""13"". 

In the data provided, respondent 13 has the following answer for 'Background (history)': <answer question=""Background (history)"">2</answer>. So their score is 2.

Next, I need to go through all other respondents and check their 'Background (history)' scores. The goal is to find any respondents (excluding 13 themselves) who also have a score of 2. 

Looking at the other respondents:

- Respondent 12: Background (history) is 3.
- Respondent 23: Background (history) is 2. So this one matches.
- Respondent 10: Background (history) is 2. Another match.
- Respondent 14: Background (history) is 2. Another match.
- Respondent 11: Background (history) is 3.
- Respondent 2: Background (history) is 2. This also matches.

Wait, but the original example had a different dataset. Wait, no, the user provided the same dataset again. Let me confirm. The data under the second <questionnaire> tag is the same as the first example. So in the responses, after respondent 13, we have respondents 14, 11, and 2. 

Wait, let me list all respondents and their 'Background (history)' scores:

- 12: 3
- 23: 2
- 10: 2
- 13: 2 (target)
- 14: 2
- 11: 3
- 2: 2

So respondents 23, 10, 14, and 2 all have a score of 2. But wait, the task says to list all respondents who scored the same as respondent 13, excluding themselves. So we need to exclude respondent 13 and include others with score 2. 

Therefore, the matching respondents are 23, 10, 14, and 2. 

But wait, in the data provided, let me check again:

Looking at each respondent:

Respondent 23: <answer question=""Background (history)"">2</answer>
Respondent 10: <answer question=""Background (history)"">2</answer>
Respondent 13: 2 (target)
Respondent 14: 2
Respondent 2: 2

So the list should be 23, 10, 14, 2. 

But wait, the original example's answer was ""None"" but that was for a different question (same date as 19, which wasn't present). Here, the task is different. 

So the final answer should be the IDs of respondents with 'Background (history)' score 2, excluding 13. So 23, 10, 14, 2.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
List all respondents who scored the same on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' as respondent '13'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to list all respondents who scored the same on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' as respondent '13'. 

First, I need to find out what score respondent 13 got for that specific question. Looking at the responses section, I'll search for the respondent with id=""13"". 

Here's the data for respondent 13:
<respondent id=""13"">
  ...
  <answer question=""Recommendation (clear recommendation)"">2</answer>
  ...
</respondent>

So, respondent 13 scored a 2 on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)'. 

Next, I need to check all other respondents to see who else has a score of 2 for the same question. Let's go through each respondent one by one.

- Respondent 12: The answer for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' is 3. Not a match.
- Respondent 10: Their score is 2. That's a match. So, id 10 is a candidate.
- Respondent 21: Score is 3. Not a match.
- Respondent 5: Score is 2. Wait, no, looking again, respondent 5's answer for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' is 2. Wait, no, let me check again. Wait, in the data provided, respondent 5's answer is 2. Wait, no, looking at the XML:

<respondent id=""5"">
  ...
  <answer question=""Recommendation (clear recommendation)"">2</answer>
  ...
</respondent>

Yes, that's correct. So respondent 5 also has a score of 2. Wait, but wait, in the data provided, let me confirm again. The data for respondent 5:

<answer question=""Recommendation (clear recommendation)"">2</answer>

Yes, that's 2. So that's a match.

Then, respondent 3: Their score is 3. Not a match.

Respondent 22: Their score is 2. So that's another match.

Wait, let me check each one again to be sure.

Respondent 12: 3 (no)
Respondent 10: 2 (yes)
Respondent 21: 3 (no)
Respondent 13: 2 (but we exclude themself)
Respondent 5: 2 (yes)
Respondent 3: 3 (no)
Respondent 22: 2 (yes)

Wait, but looking at the data for respondent 22:

<respondent id=""22"">
  <answer question=""Recommendation (clear recommendation)"">2</answer>
</respondent>

Yes, that's correct. So respondents 10, 5, and 22 all have a score of 2. But wait, the task says to exclude the respondent themselves. Wait, no, the original example had to exclude the respondent themselves, but in this task, the question is to list all respondents who scored the same as respondent 13, excluding themselves. Wait, the task says: ""List all respondents who scored the same on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' as respondent '13'."" It doesn't explicitly say to exclude respondent 13, but in the example given, they excluded the respondent themselves. However, the current task doesn't mention excluding, but the example did. Wait, the example was about the same date, and they excluded the respondent. But the current task is about the same score. Let me check the task again.

The task is: ""List all respondents who scored the same on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' as respondent '13'."" The example had a similar structure but excluded the respondent. However, the current task doesn't specify to exclude respondent 13. But in the example, the answer was ""None"" because after excluding respondent 19, there were no others. But in this case, we need to check if the task requires excluding respondent 13. The task says ""all respondents"", so unless specified, we should include all, including 13. Wait, but the example's answer was ""None"" because they excluded the respondent. Wait, the example's question was: ""Find all respondents who had a session on the same date as respondent '19', excluding the respondent themselves."" So the exclusion was part of the question. The current task doesn't mention excluding, so perhaps we should include all, including 13. But wait, the task says ""all respondents who scored the same as respondent '13'"". So if 13 is included, then the list would include 13, 10, 5, 22. But let's check the data again.

Wait, let's recheck all respondents:

Respondent 10: 2
Respondent 13: 2
Respondent 5: 2
Respondent 22: 2

Wait, no. Let me check each one again:

Looking at the XML data:

- Respondent 12: <answer question=""Recommendation (clear recommendation)"">3</answer>
- Respondent 10: <answer question=""Recommendation (clear recommendation)"">2</answer>
- Respondent 21: <answer question=""Recommendation (clear recommendation)"">3</answer>
- Respondent 13: <answer question=""Recommendation (clear recommendation)"">2</answer>
- Respondent 5: <answer question=""Recommendation (clear recommendation)"">2</answer>
- Respondent 3: <answer question=""Recommendation (clear recommendation)"">3</answer>
- Respondent 22: <answer question=""Recommendation (clear recommendation)"">2</answer>

So respondents 10, 13, 5, and 22 all have a score of 2. But the task is to list all respondents who scored the same as respondent 13. So that includes 13, but the example excluded the respondent themselves. However, the current task doesn't specify to exclude. But in the example, the instruction was explicit. Here, the task is not. So perhaps we should include all, including 13. But maybe the user expects to exclude 13. Let me check the task again.

The task says: ""List all respondents who scored the same on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' as respondent '13'."" So it's possible that the user wants to include respondent 13 in the list. But in the example, they excluded the respondent. However, in the example, the question explicitly said ""excluding the respondent themselves"". Here, the task doesn't say that. So perhaps we should include all, including 13. But that seems odd. Maybe the user wants to exclude 13. But the task doesn't state that. Hmm. This is a bit ambiguous. 

But looking at the example, the answer was ""None"" because after excluding respondent 19, there were no others. But in the current case, if we don't exclude 13, the answer would be 10,13,5,22. But perhaps the user expects to exclude 13. Let me check the task again. The task is to list all respondents who scored the same as respondent 13. So that includes 13. But maybe the user wants to exclude 13. But the example's task was different. Let me read the task again:

""List all respondents who scored the same on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' as respondent '13'.""

The wording here is ""all respondents"" who have the same score as 13. So that includes 13 themselves. But in the example, the answer excluded the respondent. However, in that example, the question explicitly said to exclude. Here, it's not mentioned. Therefore, the answer should include all respondents with the same score, including 13. But let's check the data again.

Wait, but in the data provided, the respondents are 12,10,21,13,5,3,22. So the ones with score 2 are 10,13,5,22. So the answer would be 10,13,5,22. But the task says ""list all respondents"", so including 13. However, maybe the user expects to exclude 13. But the task doesn't state that. The example's task was different because it was about the same date and excluded the respondent. Here, the task is about the same score. Unless there's a general rule to exclude the respondent in such questions unless told otherwise, but that's not specified. 

But given that the example's answer excluded the respondent, perhaps the user expects the same here. So even though the task doesn't say to exclude, maybe we should. But that's an assumption. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake. Let me check the data again. 

Wait, in the data provided, respondent 5's 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' is 2. Respondent 10: 2. Respondent 13: 2. Respondent 22: 2. So four respondents. If we exclude 13, then the answer would be 10,5,22. But if we include 13, then all four. 

But the task doesn't say to exclude. So perhaps the correct answer is 10,13,5,22. But the example's answer was ""None"" because after exclusion, there were none. However, in the example, the data for respondent 19 wasn't present. Wait, looking back at the example data, the respondents were 12,10,21,13,5,3,22. There's no respondent 19 in the data. So in the example, the answer was ""None"" because there were no other respondents with the same date as 19 (since 19 wasn't in the data). But in the current task, the data includes respondent 13, and others with the same score. 

So, given that, the answer should be 10,5,22,13. But the user might expect to exclude 13. But the task doesn't specify. This is a bit ambiguous. However, in the example, the exclusion was part of the question. Here, it's not. Therefore, the correct answer should include all respondents with the same score, including 13. 

But let me check the output rules again. The output rules say: ""If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., '17, 21, 23')"". So the answer should be the IDs of the respondents. 

So the respondents with the same score as 13 (which is 2) are 10,13,5,22. But if the task is to exclude 13, then 10,5,22. But the task doesn't say to exclude. Therefore, the answer is 10,13,5,22. However, in the example, the answer was ""None"" because after excluding the respondent, there were none. But in this case, the task doesn't mention exclusion. 

Wait, but perhaps the user made a mistake in the example. Let me check the example again. The example's data didn't have a respondent 19, so the answer was ""None"". But in the current case, the data does have respondents with the same score. 

Therefore, the correct answer is 10,13,5,22. But I need to confirm once more. 

Wait, looking at the data again:

Respondent 10: 2
Respondent 13: 2
Respondent 5: 2
Respondent 22: 2

Yes, all four. So the answer should be 10,13,5,22. But the user might have intended to exclude 13. But since the task doesn't specify, I should include all. However, in the example, the exclusion was explicit. Therefore, perhaps the user expects to exclude 13 here as well. But that's an assumption. 

Alternatively, maybe the task is to list all respondents except 13 who have the same score. But the task doesn't state that. Therefore, the correct answer is 10,13,5,22. 

But let me check the output rules again. The output should be a simple comma-separated list. So the answer is ""10, 13, 5, 22"". However, looking at the data, the order of the respondents in the XML is 12,10,21,13,5,3,22. But the order in the list doesn't matter. 

Alternatively, perhaps the user expects to list them in the order of their IDs. The IDs are 10,13,5,22. But sorted numerically, they would be 5,10,13,22. 

But the output format example in the instructions uses ""17, 21, 23"" which is in order of the IDs as they appear. But perhaps the order doesn't matter. 

So the final answer is 10,13,5,22 or sorted as 5,10,13,22. But the example in the output rules uses the order as per the data. Let me check the example's answer. The example's answer was ""None"" because there were no other respondents with the same date as 19. 

In this case, the answer should be the list of respondents with the same score as 13, including 13. Therefore, the answer is 10,13,5,22. But perhaps the user expects to exclude 13. But without explicit instruction, I should include all. 

But wait, the task says ""who scored the same as respondent '13'"". So respondent 13 is included in the list. Therefore, the answer is 10,13,5,22. 

But let me check again. The task is to list all respondents who have the same score as 13. So that includes 13. Therefore, the answer is 10,13,5,22. 

But in the example, the answer was ""None"" because after excluding 19, there were none. But in this case, the task doesn't say to exclude. So the answer should include 13. 

But perhaps the user made a mistake and expects to exclude. But I have to follow the task as given. 

Therefore, the correct answer is 10,13,5,22. But let me check the data once more to confirm. 

Yes, all four have score 2. So the answer is 10,13,5,22. However, looking back at the data, respondent 5's 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' is 2. Respondent 10: 2. Respondent 13: 2. Respondent 22: 2. 

Yes. So the answer is 10,13,5,22. But the user might have intended to exclude 13. But the task doesn't say that. Therefore, the answer should include all four.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents who scored the same on 'Assessment' as respondent '5'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to list all respondents who scored the same on 'Assessment' as respondent '5'. 

First, I need to find out what score respondent '5' received for the 'Assessment' question. Looking at the data provided, I'll search through the <responses> section for the respondent with id=""5"". 

Here's the entry for respondent 5:
<respondent id=""5"">
  ...
  <answer question=""Assessment"">3</answer>
  ...
</respondent>

So, respondent 5 has a score of 3 on the Assessment question. 

Next, I need to check all other respondents to see who else has a score of 3 in the Assessment. Let's go through each respondent one by one:

- Respondent 21: Assessment is 2 → Not a match.
- Respondent 11: Assessment is 3 → Match.
- Respondent 17: Assessment is 3 → Match.
- Respondent 3: Assessment is 3 → Match.
- Respondent 14: Assessment is 3 → Match.
- Respondent 20: Assessment is 3 → Match.
- Respondent 12: Assessment is 2 → Not a match.
- Respondent 1: Assessment is 3 → Match.
- Respondent 6: Assessment is 2 → Not a match.
- Respondent 23: Assessment is 3 → Match.

Wait, but the original data in the example had some respondents. Let me double-check the XML data provided in the latest questionnaire section to ensure I'm not mixing up with the example data. The latest data includes respondents with ids 21, 11, 5, 17, 3, 14, 20, 12, 1, 6, 23. 

Looking again at each:

- 21: Assessment 2 → No
- 11: 3 → Yes
- 5: 3 (target)
- 17: 3 → Yes
- 3: 3 → Yes
- 14: 3 → Yes
- 20: 3 → Yes
- 12: 2 → No
- 1: 3 → Yes
- 6: 2 → No
- 23: 3 → Yes

So the respondents with Assessment score 3 are 11, 17, 3, 14, 20, 1, 23, and 5. But the task says to exclude respondent '5' themselves. Wait, the task says ""list all respondents who scored the same on 'Assessment' as respondent '5'"". So we include all except respondent 5. 

Wait, the task doesn't say to exclude respondent 5, just to list those who have the same score. But the example in the problem statement had a similar task where they excluded the respondent themselves. Let me check the original example:

In the example, the task was to find respondents who had a session on the same date as respondent '19', excluding the respondent themselves. The answer was ""None"" because there were no others. So in that case, they excluded the respondent. 

But in the current task, the instruction is: ""List all respondents who scored the same on 'Assessment' as respondent '5'."" The example's answer excluded the respondent, but the current task doesn't explicitly say to exclude. However, the example's task did exclude, so maybe this one should too. Wait, the example's answer was ""None"" because there were no others. Let me check the current task again. The task says ""list all respondents"", so including or excluding? The example's task said ""excluding the respondent themselves"", but the current task doesn't specify. However, in the example, the answer was ""None"" which implies that even if there were others, they would exclude the target. But perhaps in this case, the user expects to include all including the target? Wait, but the example's answer was ""None"" because there were no other respondents with the same date as 19. Let me check the data in the example. In the example data, respondent 19 isn't present, so maybe that's why. 

But in the current task, the user hasn't specified to exclude respondent 5, so perhaps we should include all, including 5. Wait, but the example's task was to exclude, but the current task doesn't say that. Wait, the current task is different. Let me read the task again: ""List all respondents who scored the same on 'Assessment' as respondent '5'."" The wording doesn't mention excluding respondent 5. So perhaps we should include all respondents with the same score, including 5. But in the example, the answer was ""None"" because there were no others. However, in the current data, respondent 5 is part of the list. 

Wait, but the example's answer was ""None"" because in the example data, there was no respondent 19. Let me check the example data again. The example's data includes respondents with ids 21,11,5,17,3,14,20,12,1,6,23. There's no respondent 19. So the answer was ""None"" because there were no respondents with the same date as 19 (since 19 isn't present). 

But in the current task, the data includes respondent 5, and others with the same Assessment score. So the answer should include all respondents with Assessment 3, including 5. But the example's task excluded the respondent themselves. Wait, the example's task was: ""Find all respondents who had a session on the same date as respondent '19', excluding the respondent themselves."" So the exclusion was explicit. The current task doesn't have that exclusion. Therefore, the answer should include all respondents with the same score as 5, including 5. But let me check the task again. The task says ""List all respondents who scored the same on 'Assessment' as respondent '5'."" So if 5 is included in the list, then the answer would include 5. But perhaps the user expects to exclude 5. But the example's exclusion was explicit. So unless the current task says to exclude, we should include. 

But let me check the data again. Respondent 5's Assessment is 3. Other respondents with Assessment 3 are 11,17,3,14,20,1,23. So total 7 respondents including 5. But the task is to list all respondents who scored the same as 5. So including 5. But maybe the user expects to exclude 5. But the example's task had an explicit exclusion. The current task does not. Therefore, the answer should include 5. However, in some contexts, when you ask for others who have the same as a particular person, you might exclude that person. But the task here is ambiguous. But according to the problem statement, the example's answer was ""None"" because there were no others. But in the current case, if we include 5, then the answer would be 5,11,17,3,14,20,1,23. But let me check the data again to confirm each of these.

Looking at each respondent:

- 5: 3 → included
- 11: 3 → included
- 17: 3 → included
- 3: 3 → included
- 14: 3 → included
- 20: 3 → included
- 1: 3 → included
- 23: 3 → included

So that's 8 respondents. Wait, let me count again:

Respondent IDs with Assessment 3:

5, 11, 17, 3, 14, 20, 1, 23. That's 8 respondents. But wait, in the data provided, let's check each:

- 21: 2
- 11: 3
- 5: 3
- 17: 3
- 3: 3
- 14: 3
- 20: 3
- 12: 2
- 1: 3
- 6: 2
- 23: 3

Yes, that's 8 respondents. So the answer should be 5,11,17,3,14,20,1,23. But the task says ""list all respondents"", so including 5. However, in the example, the answer excluded the target respondent. But the example's task explicitly said to exclude. Here, the task does not. Therefore, the answer should include all, including 5. But perhaps the user expects to exclude 5. Let me check the task again. The task is: ""List all respondents who scored the same on 'Assessment' as respondent '5'."" So if 5 is a respondent who scored the same as themselves, then they should be included. But perhaps the user wants others. But the example's answer was ""None"" because there were no others. But in the example, the target respondent (19) wasn't present. 

Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the example. But regardless, according to the current task's wording, we should include all respondents with the same score, including 5. However, in many cases, when you ask for others who have the same as a particular person, you exclude that person. But the task doesn't specify. 

But the example's task had an explicit exclusion. The current task does not. Therefore, the answer should include all, including 5. But let's check the data again. 

Wait, the user might have intended to exclude the respondent themselves, similar to the example. But since the example's task had an explicit instruction to exclude, and this one doesn't, perhaps we should not exclude. But the example's answer was ""None"" because there were no others. 

But in this case, the answer would be 5,11,17,3,14,20,1,23. However, the user might expect to exclude 5. Let me check the data again. 

Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the example. But regardless, according to the current task's instructions, we need to follow exactly what's asked. The task says ""List all respondents who scored the same on 'Assessment' as respondent '5'."" So if respondent 5 has a score of 3, then all respondents with 3, including 5, should be listed. 

But perhaps the user expects to exclude 5. Let me think again. In the example, the task was to find others on the same date as 19, excluding 19. The current task doesn't mention exclusion, so perhaps we should include 5. 

Therefore, the answer is the list of respondents: 5,11,17,3,14,20,1,23. But let me check each of their Assessment scores again to confirm:

- 5: 3
- 11: 3
- 17: 3
- 3: 3
- 14: 3
- 20: 3
- 1: 3
- 23: 3

Yes, all of these have 3. So the answer is these IDs. But the task says to list all respondents, so the answer should be a comma-separated list of their IDs. 

But wait, the example's answer was ""None"" which was a list of zero. So the output format for a list is a comma-separated list. 

Therefore, the final answer is: 5, 11, 17, 3, 14, 20, 1, 23. But let me check if the order matters. The data lists respondents in the order 21,11,5,17,3,14,20,12,1,6,23. But the answer can be in any order. 

Alternatively, perhaps the user wants the list sorted. But the output rules say to provide a simple comma-separated list. So the order doesn't matter. 

But wait, the example's answer was ""None"" which implies that if there are no matches, output ""None"". But in this case, there are matches, so the answer is the list. 

So the final answer is the list of IDs: 5, 11, 17, 3, 14, 20, 1, 23. But wait, let me check again. 

Wait, respondent 5 is included. But if the task is to list all respondents who scored the same as 5, including 5, then yes. But if the task is to find others, then exclude 5. But the task doesn't specify. 

But the example's task had an explicit exclusion. The current task does not. Therefore, the answer should include 5. 

But perhaps the user intended to exclude 5. Let me check the example again. In the example, the task was to find others on the same date as 19, excluding 19. The answer was ""None"" because there were no others. So in that case, the exclusion was explicit. 

In the current task, since there's no exclusion, perhaps the answer should include 5. 

Therefore, the answer is: 5, 11, 17, 3, 14, 20, 1, 23.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents who scored the same on 'Background (history)' as respondent '16'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to list all respondents who scored the same on 'Background (history)' as respondent '16'. 

First, I need to find out what score respondent 16 got for 'Background (history)'. Looking at the responses section, I'll search for the respondent with id=""16"". 

Here's the data for respondent 16:
<respondent id=""16"">
  ...
  <answer question=""Background (history)"">3</answer>
  ...
</respondent>

So, the score is 3. Now, I need to find all other respondents who also have a score of 3 for 'Background (history)', excluding respondent 16 themselves.

Next, I'll go through each respondent in the responses and check their 'Background (history)' score. Let's list them out:

- Respondent 7: Background (history) = 2
- Respondent 11: Background (history) = 3
- Respondent 16: 3 (but we exclude this one)
- Respondent 23: Background (history) = 2
- Respondent 8: Background (history) = 3
- Respondent 5: Background (history) = 3
- Respondent 18: Background (history) = 2

So, the respondents with a score of 3 are 11, 8, and 5. 

Wait, let me double-check each one to make sure I didn't miss any. 

Respondent 11: 3, correct. Respondent 8: 3, yes. Respondent 5: 3, right. The others are 2 or 2. 

Therefore, the answer should be respondents 11, 8, and 5.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents who scored the same on 'Background (history)' as respondent '23'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to list all respondents who scored the same on 'Background (history)' as respondent '23'. 

First, I need to find out what score respondent 23 got for 'Background (history)'. Looking at the responses section, I'll search for the respondent with id=""23"". 

Here's the entry for respondent 23:
<respondent id=""23"">
  <answer question=""Date"">2025-03-14</answer>
  <answer question=""SessionName"">II-Anaphylaxsis</answer>
  <answer question=""Identification"">3</answer>

DID: Sepsis I Anaphylaxsis given by team</answer>
</respondent>

So, the 'Background (history)' score for respondent 23 is 2. Now, I need to check all other respondents to see who else has a score of 2 in that category. Let's go through each respondent one by one.

Respondent 20:
<answer question=""Background (history)"">2</answer> → Score 2. But wait, the task says to exclude the respondent themselves? Wait, no, the task is to list all respondents who scored the same as respondent 23, including others but not 23? Wait, the original example had to exclude respondent 19, but in this task, the instruction is just to list those who scored the same, so I think we include all except if the task says to exclude. Let me check the task again. The task says: ""List all respondents who scored the same on 'Background (history)' as respondent '23'."" There's no mention of excluding 23, but maybe the user wants others with the same score. Wait, but the example given in the first part had to exclude the respondent themselves. But in this case, the task doesn't specify that. Hmm. Wait, the example's answer was ""None"" because maybe there were no others. But in this case, the task is different. Let me make sure. The current task is to list all respondents (including 23?) who have the same score. But the example in the problem had a similar structure but different data. Let me check the example again. In the example, the user asked for respondents with the same date as 19, excluding themselves. The answer was ""None"". So in that case, the exclusion was part of the question. But in the current task, the user hasn't mentioned excluding respondent 23. So, perhaps we should include respondent 23 if they are the only one, but let's check. Wait, the task says ""list all respondents"", so if 23 is the only one with that score, then the answer would be 23. But let's check the data.

Wait, let's proceed. Let's check each respondent's 'Background (history)' score.

Respondent 20: 2 → matches.
Respondent 5: 3 → no.
Respondent 23: 2 → matches.
Respondent 13: 2 → matches.
Respondent 22: 3 → no.
Respondent 6: 3 → no.
Respondent 18: 2 → matches.
Respondent 17: 3 → no.
Respondent 12: 3 → no.
Respondent 8: 3 → no.

Wait, let me go through each one again to be sure.

Respondent 20: Background (history) is 2. So that's a match.
Respondent 5: 3. No.
Respondent 23: 2. Yes.
Respondent 13: 2. Yes.
Respondent 22: 3. No.
Respondent 6: 3. No.
Respondent 18: 2. Yes.
Respondent 17: 3. No.
Respondent 12: 3. No.
Respondent 8: 3. No.

So the respondents with 'Background (history)' score 2 are 20, 23, 13, 18. But wait, the task says ""list all respondents who scored the same as respondent '23'"". Since respondent 23's score is 2, we need to list all respondents (including 23?) with that score. But the example in the problem had to exclude the respondent themselves. However, the current task does not specify to exclude respondent 23. So, should we include them? The example's answer was ""None"" because perhaps there were no others. But in this case, there are others. Wait, but the example's data might have had no one else on the same date as 19. Let me check the example data again. In the example, the data for respondent 19 isn't shown, but the answer was ""None"". But in the current task, the data is the same as the example's data. Wait, looking back, the example's data includes respondents 20,5,23,13,22,6,18,17,12,8. The example's answer was ""None"" when looking for same date as 19, which might not be present. But in the current task, the data is the same as the example's data. Wait, no, the user provided the same data twice. Wait, the user included the same XML data twice, once in the example and once in the actual question. Wait, looking at the user's input, after the example, there's another <questionnaire> block. Wait, perhaps the actual data for the current task is the same as the example's data. Let me check.

Wait, the user provided:

<example>
... data ...
</example>

Then, the actual question is:

<questionnaire>
... same data as in the example ...
</questionnaire>

So the data for the current task is the same as the example's data. Therefore, the respondents are the same. So in the current task, respondent 23 has a 'Background (history)' score of 2. Let's check all respondents again:

Looking at the data:

Respondent 20: Background (history) is 2 → match.
Respondent 5: 3 → no.
Respondent 23: 2 → match.
Respondent 13: 2 → match.
Respondent 22: 3 → no.
Respondent 6: 3 → no.
Respondent 18: 2 → match.
Respondent 17: 3 → no.
Respondent 12: 3 → no.
Respondent 8: 3 → no.

So the respondents with score 2 are 20, 23, 13, 18. But the task says to list all respondents who scored the same as respondent '23'. So that includes 23? The example's answer was ""None"" because perhaps in that case, there were no others. But in this case, there are others. However, the task does not specify to exclude respondent 23. So the answer should include 20, 23, 13, 18. But wait, let me check the data again to confirm.

Looking at each respondent:

- Respondent 20: <answer question=""Background (history)"">2</answer> → yes.
- Respondent 23: <answer question=""Background (history)"">2</answer> → yes.
- Respondent 13: <answer question=""Background (history)"">2</answer> → yes.
- Respondent 18: <answer question=""Background (history)"">2</answer> → yes.

So the list is 20,23,13,18. But the task says ""list all respondents"", so the answer should be these four IDs. However, the example's answer was ""None"", but that was for a different question. So in this case, the answer is 20,23,13,18. But wait, the user might have intended to exclude the respondent themselves, but the task doesn't say that. The example's task was to exclude, but this task doesn't. So unless the user made a mistake, we should follow the task as written. Therefore, the answer is 20,23,13,18.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents who scored the same on 'Situation' as respondent '15'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The goal is to find all respondents who scored the same on the 'Situation' question as respondent '15'. First, I need to understand what the 'Situation' question entails. According to the questions section, the 'Situation' question has a rubric where scores range from 0 to 3. The exact question is about identifying the main problem(s), with 3 being the highest score.

Next, I need to find out what score respondent '15' received for 'Situation'. Looking at the responses, respondent '15' has an answer for 'Situation' which is '3'. 

Now, I have to check all other respondents to see who else has a '3' in their 'Situation' answer. Let's go through each respondent one by one:

- Respondent 14: Their 'Situation' score is 3.
- Respondent 12: Their 'Situation' score is 3.
- Respondent 22: Their 'Situation' score is 3.
- Respondent 8: Their 'Situation' score is 3.
- Respondent 15: This is the one we're comparing against, so we exclude them from the list as per the task (though the task doesn't say to exclude, but just to list those with the same score, including 15? Wait, the task says ""list all respondents"", so maybe including 15? Wait, the example given in the first part excluded the respondent themselves, but in this task, the instruction is just to list those who scored the same, so unless specified to exclude, we include. Let me check the task again. The task says: ""List all respondents who scored the same on 'Situation' as respondent '15'."" So it's possible that respondent 15 is included unless the task says to exclude. But the example in the first part had a similar question where they excluded the respondent themselves. However, in this case, the task doesn't specify exclusion. Hmm. Wait, the example was about finding respondents on the same date as '19' and excluding themselves. But here, the task is different. Let me read the task again: ""List all respondents who scored the same on 'Situation' as respondent '15'."" So the answer should include all respondents with the same score, including 15 if applicable. But let's check the data.

Looking at the data:

Respondent 15's 'Situation' is 3. Now, checking others:

- Respondent 14: 3
- Respondent 12: 3
- Respondent 22: 3
- Respondent 8: 3
- Respondent 15: 3

So all respondents except maybe some? Wait, looking at the data again:

Wait, the data provided in the responses section includes respondents 14, 12, 22, 8, and 15. All of them have 'Situation' score 3. So all of them, including 15, have the same score. But the task is to list all respondents who scored the same as '15', so that would include 15 as well. However, in the example given, when they were looking for the same date as respondent '19', they excluded '19' themselves. But in that example, the answer was 'None' because there were no others. Wait, in the example, the data had respondents 14, 12, 22, 8, 15. The task was to find those with the same date as '19', but '19' wasn't in the data, so the answer was 'None'. But in this case, the task is about respondent '15', which is present. So, should we include '15' in the list? The example's instruction was to exclude the respondent themselves, but the current task doesn't specify that. However, the example's task was about the same date, and the current task is about the same score. The user might expect to include all, including 15, unless instructed otherwise. But perhaps the example's exclusion is a hint. Wait, the example's answer was 'None' because there were no other respondents with the same date as '19' (since '19' wasn't in the data). But in this case, the data shows that all respondents have 'Situation' score 3. Wait, let me check again:

Looking at the responses:

- Respondent 14: Situation 3
- Respondent 12: Situation 3
- Respondent 22: Situation 3
- Respondent 8: Situation 3
- Respondent 15: Situation 3

So all five respondents have a 'Situation' score of 3. Therefore, all of them, including 15, have the same score. But the task is to list all respondents who scored the same as '15'. So that would be all five. However, the example in the first part had a similar structure but excluded the respondent themselves. But in that example, the task was to exclude, but here, the task doesn't say to exclude. So perhaps the answer is all five. But let me check again. The task says: ""List all respondents who scored the same on 'Situation' as respondent '15'."" So that includes '15' themselves. Therefore, the answer should be all five respondents: 14, 12, 22, 8, 15. But wait, looking at the data again, the respondents are 14, 12, 22, 8, 15. All have 'Situation' 3. So the answer is all of them. But the example's answer was 'None' because there were no others. But in this case, there are others. So the answer should be a list of all their IDs. Let me confirm once more. Yes, all respondents have 'Situation' 3. Therefore, the answer is all the respondent IDs: 14, 12, 22, 8, 15.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents who scored the same on 'Background (examination)' as respondent '22'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to list all respondents who scored the same on 'Background (examination)' as respondent '22'. 

First, I need to find out what score respondent '22' received for 'Background (examination)'. Looking at the data provided, I'll search through the <responses> section for the respondent with id=""22"". 

Here's the entry for respondent 22:
<respondent id=""22"">
  <answer question=""Date"">2025-05-16</answer>
  <answer question=""SessionName"">IV (VT)</answer>
  <answer question=""Identification"">3</answer>
  <answer question=""Situation"">3</answer>
  <answer question=""Background (history)"">3</answer>
  <answer question=""Background (examination)"">3</answer>
  <answer question=""Assessment"">2</answer>
  <answer question=""Recommendation (clear recommendation)"">2</answer>
  <answer question=""Recommendation (global rating scale)"">3</answer>
  <answer question=""Comments"">Clear communication skills
Good</answer>
</respondent>

So, the 'Background (examination)' score for respondent 22 is 3.

Next, I need to go through all other respondents and check their 'Background (examination)' scores. The task is to list all respondents (excluding respondent 22 themselves) who also have a score of 3 in that category.

Let's go through each respondent one by one:

- **Respondent 15**: Background (examination) = 3 → matches.
- **Respondent 10**: Background (examination) = 2 → doesn't match.
- **Respondent 13**: Background (examination) = 1 → doesn't match.
- **Respondent 17**: Background (examination) = 3 → matches.
- **Respondent 20**: Background (examination) = -1 → doesn't match.
- **Respondent 14**: Background (examination) = 2 → doesn't match.
- **Respondent 6**: Background (examination) = 3 → matches.
- **Respondent 7**: Background (examination) = 3 → matches.
- **Respondent 21**: Background (examination) = 1 → doesn't match.
- **Respondent 3**: Background (examination) = 3 → matches.
- **Respondent 5**: Background (examination) = 3 → matches.

Wait, let me double-check each to ensure accuracy:

- **15**: Yes, 3.
- **17**: 3.
- **6**: 3.
- **7**: 3.
- **3**: 3.
- **5**: 3.

So, the respondents with id 15, 17, 6, 7, 3, and 5 all have a score of 3 in 'Background (examination)'. Since we need to exclude respondent 22 themselves, but none of these are 22, all are valid.

Therefore, the final list should include these IDs.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondents participated in the same session name as respondent '23'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find which respondents participated in the same session name as respondent '23'. First, I need to understand the data structure provided.

Looking at the XML data, each respondent has an 'id' and various answers, including 'SessionName'. The goal is to compare the 'SessionName' of respondent '23' with others and find matches, excluding respondent '23' themselves.

First, I need to find the 'SessionName' for respondent '23'. Scanning through the responses, I find that respondent '23' has the SessionName ""II-Anaphylaxsis"". Wait, but there's a possible typo here—""Anaphylaxsis"" instead of ""Anaphylaxis""? However, the data should be taken as-is unless instructed otherwise. So the exact session name is ""II-Anaphylaxsis"".

Next, I need to check all other respondents' SessionNames to see if they match ""II-Anaphylaxsis"". Let's go through each respondent:

- Respondent 14: SessionName is ""IV-Hypoglycemia"" – no match.
- Respondent 3: ""III-Sepsis"" – no.
- Respondent 8: ""III (Sepsis)"" – no.
- Respondent 15: ""III - Sepsis"" – no.
- Respondent 12: ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" – here, the session name is ""II (Anaphylaxis)"". The roman numeral is II, and the condition is Anaphylaxis. The spelling here is different from respondent 23's ""Anaphylaxsis"". Are these considered the same? The problem states to look for the same session name. Since the names are spelled differently (""Anaphylaxsis"" vs. ""Anaphylaxis""), they might be considered different. However, sometimes typos or variations might be present. But according to the data, we must take the exact value. So ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" vs. ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" – not an exact match. So respondent 12 doesn't match.

- Respondent 1: ""V (Hypoglycemia)"" – no.
- Respondent 23: Excluded as per the task.

Wait, but maybe there's another respondent with the same session name. Let me check again. The session names are:

- 14: IV-Hypoglycemia
- 3: III-Sepsis
- 8: III (Sepsis)
- 15: III - Sepsis
- 12: II (Anaphylaxis)
- 1: V (Hypoglycemia)
- 23: II-Anaphylaxsis

Looking at these, the only session that has ""II"" and ""Anaphylaxsis"" is respondent 23. The others with ""II"" are respondent 12, but their session is ""II (Anaphylaxis)"", which is a different spelling. Therefore, there are no other respondents with the exact same session name as respondent 23. 

But wait, maybe the session name is considered the same despite formatting differences like hyphens vs. parentheses? For example, ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" vs. ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" – but the problem says ""same session name"". The data shows that session names can vary in formatting (e.g., ""III-Sepsis"", ""III (Sepsis)"", ""III - Sepsis"") but those are all considered different session names. Therefore, exact string matching is required. Since respondent 23's session name is ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" and no one else has that exact string, the answer would be none. However, I need to check if there's any other respondent with the same session name. Let me double-check:

Looking at respondent 12's session name: ""II (Anaphylaxis)"". The condition is Anaphylaxis, but the session name is written differently. So no exact match. Therefore, the answer is that there are no other respondents with the same session name as respondent 23.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents who scored the same on 'Situation' as respondent '4'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The goal is to find all respondents who scored the same on the 'Situation' question as respondent '4'. 

First, I need to locate respondent '4' in the data. Looking through the responses, I find that respondent '4' has an answer for the 'Situation' question. The value given is ""3"". 

Next, I need to check all other respondents to see who else has a 'Situation' score of 3. Let's go through each respondent one by one:

- Respondent 23: Situation is 3.
- Respondent 5: Situation is 3.
- Respondent 16: Situation is 3.
- Respondent 15: Situation is 3.
- Respondent 1: Situation is 2.
- Respondent 3: Situation is 2.
- Respondent 19: Situation is 3.
- Respondent 9: Situation is 3.
- Respondent 14: Situation is 3.
- Respondent 18: Situation is 3.
- Respondent 21: Situation is 2.

Now, compiling all respondents with 'Situation' score 3, excluding respondent '4' themselves. The respondents are 23, 5, 16, 15, 19, 9, 14, 18. 

Wait, let me double-check. Respondent 4's 'Situation' is 3. So any other respondent with 3 should be included. The list includes 23,5,16,15,19,9,14,18. Let me confirm each:

- 23: 3 ✔️
- 5: 3 ✔️
- 16: 3 ✔️
- 15: 3 ✔️
- 19: 3 ✔️
- 9: 3 ✔️
- 14: 3 ✔️
- 18: 3 ✔️

Yes, all these have 'Situation' score 3. So the answer should be these IDs separated by commas.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents who scored the same on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' as respondent '12' and also scored perfectly on 'Background (examination)'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to list all respondents who scored the same on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' as respondent '12' and also scored perfectly on 'Background (examination)'. 

First, I need to find out what score respondent '12' has for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)'. Looking at the responses, respondent 12's answer for that question is 3. Wait, no, let me check again. The data shows:

<respondent id=""12"">
  ...
  <answer question=""Recommendation (clear recommendation)"">3</answer>
  ...
</respondent>

So, respondent 12 scored 3 on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)'. 

Next, I need to find all other respondents who also have a score of 3 in that same question. Then, among those, they must have a perfect score (which according to the rubric for 'Background (examination)' is 3) on that question.

Looking through each respondent:

- Respondent 3: 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' is 3. 'Background (examination)' is 3. So this one qualifies.
- Respondent 4: 'Recommendation' is 2. Doesn't match.
- Respondent 16: 'Recommendation' is 2. No.
- Respondent 20: 'Recommendation' is 2. No.
- Respondent 18: 'Recommendation' is 2. No.
- Respondent 1: 'Recommendation' is 2. No.
- Respondent 17: 'Recommendation' is 3. 'Background (examination)' is 3. So this one qualifies.
- Respondent 8: 'Recommendation' is 2. No.
- Respondent 12: The target, but we exclude them as per the example (though the task doesn't say to exclude, but the example did. Wait, the task here is different. The example was about same date, but this task is about same score. The task says ""excluding the respondent themselves""? Wait, no. The original example excluded respondent 19, but in this task, the user didn't specify to exclude respondent 12. Wait, the current task is: ""List all respondents who scored the same on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' as respondent '12' and also scored perfectly on 'Background (examination)'."" So we need to include respondent 12 if they meet the criteria. Wait, but respondent 12's 'Background (examination)' score is 3. Let me check:

Looking at respondent 12's 'Background (examination)' answer: 

<answer question=""Background (examination)"">3</answer>

So they have a perfect score. Therefore, respondent 12 would be included. But wait, the task says ""all respondents"" which includes 12? Or does it exclude them? The example had a similar task where they excluded the respondent themselves, but the current task doesn't specify that. So I need to check the exact wording. The task says ""List all respondents who scored the same... as respondent '12'..."". So if respondent 12 themselves meets both conditions, they should be included. But let me check the data again.

Respondent 12's 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' is 3, and 'Background (examination)' is 3. So they meet both criteria. Therefore, they should be included in the list. However, sometimes such questions might imply excluding the original respondent, but the user's task here doesn't state that. So I have to follow the exact instructions.

Continuing with the list:

- Respondent 23: 'Recommendation' is 3. 'Background (examination)' is 2. So no.
- Respondent 5: 'Recommendation' is 2. No.
- Respondent 7: 'Recommendation' is 2. No.

So the respondents who meet both conditions are:

- Respondent 3
- Respondent 12
- Respondent 17

Wait, let me verify each:

Respondent 3: 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' is 3, 'Background (examination)' is 3. Yes.

Respondent 12: Both scores 3. Yes.

Respondent 17: 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' is 3, 'Background (examination)' is 3. Yes.

So the answer should be 3, 12, 17. But let me check if there are others. Are there any other respondents with 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' 3 and 'Background (examination)' 3?

Looking again:

Respondent 3: Yes.

Respondent 12: Yes.

Respondent 17: Yes.

Any others? Let's check all:

Respondent 23: 'Recommendation' is 3, but 'Background (examination)' is 2. No.

Respondent 5: 'Recommendation' is 2. No.

Respondent 7: 'Recommendation' is 2. No.

So the three respondents are 3, 12, 17.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Find all respondents who participated in the same session name as respondent '12' and whose comments contain the word 'Good'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find all respondents who participated in the same session name as respondent '12' and whose comments include the word 'Good'. 

First, I need to find out what session name respondent '12' had. Looking at the responses section, I'll search for the respondent with id=""12"". 

Here's the data for respondent 12:
<respondent id=""12"">
  <answer question=""Date"">2025-05-02</answer>
  <answer question=""SessionName"">II (Anaphylaxis)</answer>
  ...
</respondent>

So, the session name for respondent 12 is ""II (Anaphylaxis)"". 

Next, I need to find all other respondents who have the same session name. The session names might have slight variations, so I should check for exact matches. Let's go through each respondent:

- Respondent 1: SessionName is ""V (Hypoglycemia)"" – not a match.
- Respondent 3: ""III-Sepsis"" – different.
- Respondent 22: ""IV (VT)"" – nope.
- Respondent 8: ""III (Sepsis)"" – no.
- Respondent 4: ""III (Sepsis)"" – no.
- Respondent 11: ""IV (AF)"" – not matching.
- Respondent 5: ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" – the name here is similar but has a hyphen and an extra 's' (Anaphylaxsis vs Anaphylaxis). Hmm, possible typo? But the task says ""same session name"", so exact match is required. So this might not be considered the same.
- Respondent 23: ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" – again, similar but different formatting and spelling. The original is ""II (Anaphylaxis)"", so the session names here are ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" and ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" (respondent 5). These might be variations but not exact matches. So they might not be included.
- Respondent 6: ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"" – different.

Wait, but maybe the session names are considered the same even with slight formatting differences? The problem states ""same session name"", so I have to take the exact string. For example, respondent 12's session is ""II (Anaphylaxis)"", while respondent 5's is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"". The spelling of Anaphylaxsis vs Anaphylaxis could be a typo, but unless the data explicitly states they are the same, we can't assume. So these are different.

So the only exact match for ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" is respondent 12 themselves. But the task says to exclude the respondent themselves. Wait, no, the task is to find others who have the same session name as respondent 12. But looking at the data, no other respondents have ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" exactly. 

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again. Are there any other respondents with ""II (Anaphylaxis)""? Let's see:

Looking through all the SessionNames:

- Respondent 12: II (Anaphylaxis)
- Respondent 5: II - Anaphylaxsis
- Respondent 23: II-Anaphylaxsis
- Respondent 6: II (Anaphylactic Shock)

No, none of the others have ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" exactly. So the only one is respondent 12. But the task says to find others, so perhaps the session name is considered the same if the core part matches, but according to the data, the session names are different. For example, ""Anaphylaxis"" vs ""Anaphylaxsis"" (with an extra 's') might be a typo, but unless the data says they are the same, we can't assume. Therefore, there are no other respondents with the exact same session name as respondent 12.

But wait, the task might consider variations. Let me check the example given. In the example, the answer was ""None"" because after checking, there were no other respondents with the same date as 19. So perhaps here, even if there are similar session names, unless they are exact matches, they are excluded.

Therefore, the first part of the task (same session name as respondent 12) yields no other respondents. But let's proceed to check the comments for 'Good' just in case.

But even if there were others with the same session name, we need to check their comments. Respondent 12's comments are ""Good"". So looking for others with the same session name (if any) and whose comments include 'Good'.

But since there are no other respondents with the exact session name, the answer would be none. However, let's double-check if any other respondents have session names that are considered the same. For example, respondent 5's session is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"". If the session name is considered the same as ""II (Anaphylaxis)"", then respondent 5 would be a candidate. But the problem is that the session names are different strings. Unless the data has a typo, but the user hasn't indicated that. So we must treat them as different.

Therefore, the answer is that there are no respondents other than 12 with the exact session name ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" and comments containing 'Good'. But wait, respondent 8's comments include ""Good"", but their session name is ""III (Sepsis)"", which is different. Respondent 5's comments also have ""Good"", but their session name is different. Respondent 22's comments include ""Good"", but their session is ""IV (VT)"". So even if we considered session name variations, but the task requires the same session name as respondent 12, which is ""II (Anaphylaxis)"", and no one else has that exact name. Hence, the answer is none.
</think>

12, 8, 5, 22

Wait, no. Let me correct. The correct answer is:

The respondents with the same session name as '12' (II (Anaphylaxis)) are none except '12' themselves. However, looking for others with the same session name and comments containing 'Good', but since no one else has the exact session name, the answer is none. But wait, the example had the answer as ""None"" when there were no matches. However, in the data provided, respondent 12's comments are ""Good"". But the task is to find others who have the same session name and comments with 'Good'. Since respondent 12 is excluded (as per the example's logic, which excludes the respondent themselves), but the task here doesn't say to exclude respondent 12. Wait, the task says ""Find all respondents who participated in the same session name as respondent '12' and whose comments contain the word 'Good'."" So including respondent 12 if their comments have 'Good'. 

Wait, the example had a similar task but excluded the respondent themselves. Let me check the original task again. The example's task was to find respondents with the same date as '19', excluding themselves. The current task does not mention excluding respondent 12. So in this case, if respondent 12's comments contain 'Good', they should be included. 

Looking at respondent 12's comments: ""Good"". So they do contain 'Good'. Therefore, respondent 12 is a match. Are there others with the same session name? No. So the answer is 12. But wait, the session name for respondent 12 is ""II (Anaphylaxis)"". Are there any other respondents with that exact session name? Let me check again:

- Respondent 5: ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" (different)
- Respondent 23: ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" (different)
- Respondent 6: ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"" (different)
- No others. 

So only respondent 12 has the exact session name. Therefore, the answer is 12. But the task says ""find all respondents"", so if 12's comments include 'Good', then 12 is included. But the example's answer was ""None"" because it excluded the respondent themselves. However, the current task does not specify to exclude respondent 12. Therefore, the answer should be 12. But let me check the task again: ""Find all respondents who participated in the same session name as respondent '12' and whose comments contain the word 'Good'."" So it's possible that respondent 12 is included. But in the example, the answer was ""None"" because they excluded the respondent themselves. However, the current task does not state to exclude respondent 12. Therefore, the answer is 12. But the example's instruction might have influenced the approach. Wait, the example's task was to exclude the respondent themselves, but this task does not. Therefore, the answer is 12. However, in the data, respondent 12's comments are ""Good"", so they meet the criteria. Therefore, the answer is 12. But I need to check if there are others. 

Wait, perhaps the session name is considered the same even with variations. For example, respondent 5's session is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"". If the session name is considered the same as ""II (Anaphylaxis)"", then respondent 5 would be included. But the session names are different strings. Unless there's a typo, but the data should be taken as is. Therefore, only respondent 12 matches. So the answer is 12. But the example's answer was ""None"" when there were no others. But in this case, the answer is 12. However, the user might have intended to exclude the respondent themselves, but the task does not specify that. Therefore, the answer is 12. But I need to confirm. 

Alternatively, maybe the session name for respondent 12 is ""II (Anaphylaxis)"", and others have similar names. For example, respondent 5's session is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"". If the session name is considered the same (despite the hyphen and extra 's'), then respondent 5 would be included. But the data does not indicate that these are the same. Therefore, the answer is only 12. But respondent 5's comments also have ""Good"". So if their session name is considered the same, then 5 and 12 would be included. But since the session names are different, they are not. 

Therefore, the correct answer is 12. But the example's answer was ""None"" when there were no matches. But in this case, there is one match. However, the user's example might have been a different scenario. But according to the data, the answer is 12. 

Wait, but looking back, the example's data had respondent 19 not present, so the answer was ""None"". In this case, respondent 12 exists and meets the criteria. Therefore, the answer is 12. But the output format requires a comma-separated list of IDs. So the answer is ""12"". 

But wait, let me check the data again. Respondent 8's comments include ""Good"" and their session name is ""III (Sepsis)"", which is different. Respondent 5's comments have ""Good"" but their session name is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"". If the session name is considered the same as ""II (Anaphylaxis)"", then 5 would be included. But the exact strings are different. Therefore, the answer is only 12. 

But the task says ""same session name as respondent '12'"". The session name for 12 is ""II (Anaphylaxis)"". No other respondents have that exact session name. Therefore, the answer is 12. But the example's answer was ""None"" when there were no others. However, in this case, the respondent themselves is included. But the task does not say to exclude them. Therefore, the answer is 12. 

But the example's task was to exclude the respondent themselves. The current task does not specify that. Therefore, the answer is 12. 

But the user's example answer was ""None"" because the respondent 19 was excluded. But in this case, the task does not say to exclude respondent 12. Therefore, the answer is 12. 

But the output format requires a list of IDs. So the answer is ""12"". 

But let me check again. The task is to find all respondents who participated in the same session name as respondent '12' and whose comments contain 'Good'. 

Respondent 12's session name is ""II (Anaphylaxis)"", comments ""Good"". So they meet the criteria. Are there others with the same session name? No. Therefore, the answer is 12. 

But the example's answer was ""None"" because it excluded the respondent themselves. However, the current task does not state to exclude the respondent. Therefore, the answer is 12. 

But perhaps the user intended to exclude the respondent themselves, similar to the example. But the example's task explicitly said ""excluding the respondent themselves"", while this task does not. Therefore, the answer should include respondent 12. 

But the example's answer was ""None"" because there were no other respondents on the same date as 19. In this case, there is one respondent (12) who meets the criteria. Therefore, the answer is 12. 

But the output format requires a list. So the answer is ""12"". 

But wait, looking back at the data, respondent 5's session name is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"". If the session name is considered the same as ""II (Anaphylaxis)"", then 5 would be included. But the exact strings are different. Therefore, they are not. 

Therefore, the final answer is 12. 

But the example's answer was ""None"" when there were no others. But here, the answer is 12. 

But the user's example had the answer as ""None"" because the respondent 19 was excluded. But in this case, the task does not say to exclude the respondent. Therefore, the answer is 12. 

But the output format requires a list. So the answer is ""12"".

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' is higher than the average 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' for all sessions that happened on the same date as respondent '16's session.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find all respondents whose 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' score is higher than the average of that same score for all sessions that happened on the same date as respondent '16's session. 

First, I need to figure out the date of respondent '16's session. Looking at the responses, respondent 16 has the date '2025-05-02'. So, all sessions on that date are the ones we need to consider for calculating the average.

Next, I need to collect all the 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' scores from respondents who had sessions on 2025-05-02. Let's check each respondent's date:

- Respondent 8: 2025-05-02, score 2
- Respondent 1: 2025-05-02, score 2
- Respondent 16: 2025-05-02, score 2 (but we exclude this one if the average is for the same date as 16's session, but the task says ""all sessions that happened on the same date as respondent '16's session"", so we include all, including 16's. Wait, but when calculating the average, do we include respondent 16's own score? The task says ""for all sessions that happened on the same date as respondent '16's session"". So yes, all sessions on that date, including 16. So the scores are 2 (respondent 8), 2 (respondent 1), 2 (respondent 16), and 3 (respondent 16's own score? Wait, no. Wait, looking back, respondent 16's 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' is 2. So the three respondents on 2025-05-02 are 8, 1, and 16. Their scores are 2, 2, and 2. So the average is (2 + 2 + 2) / 3 = 2. The average is 2.

Now, we need to find all respondents (regardless of their session date) whose 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' score is higher than this average of 2. So we look for scores greater than 2. 

Looking through all respondents:

- Respondent 21: 3
- Respondent 9: 3
- Respondent 8: 2
- Respondent 4: 2
- Respondent 1: 2
- Respondent 6: 2
- Respondent 16: 2
- Respondent 13: 2
- Respondent 15: 2
- Respondent 22: 2

Only respondents 21 and 9 have a score of 3, which is higher than the average of 2. 

So the answer should be the IDs of these respondents: 21 and 9.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
