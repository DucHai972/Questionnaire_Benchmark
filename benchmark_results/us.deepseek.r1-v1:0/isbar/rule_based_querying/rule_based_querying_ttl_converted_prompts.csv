</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents from the '(MI)-VT' session whose 'Identification' is exactly 0.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to list all respondents from the '(MI)-VT' session whose 'Identification' score is exactly 0. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The data provided includes several respondents, each with various attributes like SessionName, Identification, Situation, etc. The key here is to filter respondents based on two criteria: their SessionName must be exactly '(MI)-VT', and their Identification score must be 0.

Looking at the 'Questions' section, the 'Identification' field has a rubric where 0 means ""Requires direct prompting"". So, the 'Identification' value in the responses should be ""0"" for the respondents we're looking for.

Now, I'll go through each respondent in the 'Responses' section one by one to check these two conditions.

Starting with :Respondent16. Their SessionName is ""I - MI"", which doesn't match '(MI)-VT'. So, skip.

Next, :Respondent7 has SessionName ""III-Sepsis"". Not matching. Skip.

:Respondent11's SessionName is ""IV (AF)"". Doesn't match. Skip.

:Respondent10's SessionName is ""(MI)-VT"". That's a match. Now check their Identification score. It's ""2"". Since we need exactly 0, this respondent doesn't qualify. So, no.

:Respondent1's SessionName is ""V (Hypoglycemia)"". Not matching. Skip.

:Respondent22 has SessionName ""IV (VT)"". Close, but not exactly '(MI)-VT'. Skip.

:Respondent18's SessionName is ""IV - VT"". Again, not the exact match. Skip.

:Respondent4's SessionName is ""III (Sepsis)"". Doesn't match. 

Wait, did I miss any other respondents? Let me check again. The list includes 8 respondents: 16,7,11,10,1,22,18,4. All have been checked. 

None of the respondents in the '(MI)-VT' session (which is only Respondent10) have an Identification score of 0. Respondent10's Identification is 2. Therefore, there are no respondents that meet both criteria.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents from the 'MI' session whose 'Assessment' is exactly 2.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The question is asking to list all respondents from the 'MI' session whose 'Assessment' is exactly 2. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The data has a 'responses' section with various respondents, each having properties like pred:SessionName and pred:Assessment. The task is to filter these respondents based on two criteria: their SessionName must be 'MI' and their Assessment score must be exactly 2.

Looking at the 'Questions' section, the 'Assessment' question is defined with a rubric where 0 to 3 are possible scores. The exact value we're looking for is 2, which corresponds to ""Assessment after minimal questioning"". But since the output doesn't require the text but the actual respondents, I just need to check the numerical value.

Now, I'll go through each respondent in the 'responses' section and check these two conditions.

Starting with :Respondent7: SessionName is ""III-Sepsis"" – not MI. So skip.

:Respondent12: SessionName is ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" – not MI. Skip.

:Respondent11: SessionName ""IV (AF)"" – nope.

:Respondent14: ""IV-Hypoglycemia"" – not MI.

:Respondent2: SessionName is ""MI"". Now check the Assessment. pred:Assessment ""3"" – so doesn't meet the second condition. So exclude.

:Respondent8: SessionName ""III (Sepsis)"" – not MI.

:Respondent5: SessionName ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" – no.

:Respondent1: ""V (Hypoglycemia)"" – no.

:Respondent17: ""V (Hypoglycemia)"" – no.

:Respondent9: ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"" – no.

Wait, did I miss any? Let me check again. All respondents have been checked. None of the respondents in the 'MI' session have an Assessment of 2. The only MI session is Respondent2, but their Assessment is 3. So the answer should be an empty list.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents from the 'II (Anaphylaxis)' session whose 'Identification' is exactly 0.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The task is to list all respondents from the 'II (Anaphylaxis)' session who have an 'Identification' score of exactly 0. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The questions section defines each field. The 'SessionName' is an open-ended question, so the responses can vary, but I need to match exactly 'II (Anaphylaxis)'. The 'Identification' field uses a rubric where 0 means ""Requires direct prompting"".

Now, looking at the responses. I'll go through each respondent one by one.

Starting with Respondent9: SessionName is ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"". Wait, that's spelled with an extra 's'—Anaphylaxsis instead of Anaphylaxis. That might be a typo, but the task says exactly 'II (Anaphylaxis)', so this doesn't match. Their Identification is 3, so no.

Respondent16: SessionName is ""I - MI"". Not the right session. Identification is 3. Skip.

Respondent21: SessionName is ""I (Myocardial infarction)"". Not the target session. Identification is 3. Skip.

Respondent22: SessionName is ""IV (VT)"". Not relevant. Identification 3. Skip.

Respondent15: SessionName ""III - Sepsis"". Nope. Identification 3.

Respondent6: SessionName ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"". Close but not exactly 'II (Anaphylaxis)'. The name is slightly different. So this doesn't match. Identification is 3.

Respondent12: SessionName is ""II (Anaphylaxis)"". Perfect match. Now check Identification. Their Identification is 3. So even though the session matches, the score is 3, not 0. So exclude.

Respondent18: SessionName ""IV - VT"". Not matching. Identification 3.

Respondent3: SessionName ""III-Sepsis"". Not the right session. However, their Identification is 0. But since the session doesn't match, they're out.

Respondent17: SessionName ""V (Hypoglycemia)"". No. Identification 3.

So, after checking all respondents, none are in the 'II (Anaphylaxis)' session with Identification 0. The only respondent with Identification 0 is Respondent3, but their session is III-Sepsis. Therefore, the answer should be an empty list.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents from the 'III-Sepsis' session whose 'Background (examination)' is exactly 2.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The task is to list all respondents from the 'III-Sepsis' session where their 'Background (examination)' score is exactly 2. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The 'questions' section defines each field. The 'Background (examination)' corresponds to the predicate pred:Background_examination, which has a rubric. The responses are in the 'responses' section, each with various predicates.

Looking at the 'SessionName' in the responses, I need to find entries where pred:SessionName exactly matches ""III-Sepsis"". Then, check their pred:Background_examination value. The question specifies the score must be exactly 2. 

Let me go through each respondent:

- Respondent3: SessionName is ""III-Sepsis"", Background_examination is 3. Doesn't meet the score 2.
- Respondent7: SessionName is ""III-Sepsis"", Background_examination is 3. Also doesn't meet.
- Respondent15: SessionName is ""III - Sepsis"". Wait, the hyphen and spacing here might be different. The task specifies 'III-Sepsis' exactly. The entry here is ""III - Sepsis"" with spaces and a hyphen. That's a different string, so it doesn't match. So Respondent15 is out.
- Other respondents have different SessionNames like ""II - Anaphylaxsis"", ""V (Hypoglycemia)"", etc. 

None of the respondents with SessionName exactly ""III-Sepsis"" have a Background_examination of 2. Therefore, there are no respondents that meet both criteria.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'Assessment' score is between 0 and 1.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The goal is to find all respondents whose 'Assessment' score is between 0 and 1. 

First, I need to understand what the 'Assessment' question entails. Looking at the questions section, the 'Assessment' is defined as: ""Makes logical assessment (correlates problem, history, exam, context). [Rubric: 0 = No logical assessment, 1 = Assessment only after extended questioning, 2 = Assessment after minimal questioning, 3 = Comprehensive logical assessment without questioning]"". 

So the rubric for Assessment has possible scores from 0 to 3. The task is to find respondents with a score between 0 and 1. That means scores of 0 or 1. However, since the rubric uses integers, the possible values here are 0, 1, 2, or 3. The range between 0 and 1 would include 0 and 1.

Now, I need to go through each respondent in the responses section and check their 'pred:Assessment' value. 

Let's list out all respondents and their Assessment scores:

- Respondent22: pred:Assessment ""2""
- Respondent16: pred:Assessment ""3""
- Respondent1: pred:Assessment ""3""
- Respondent21: pred:Assessment ""2""
- Respondent18: pred:Assessment ""3""
- Respondent19: pred:Assessment ""2""
- Respondent14: pred:Assessment ""3""
- Respondent20: pred:Assessment ""3""
- Respondent23: pred:Assessment ""3""
- Respondent9: pred:Assessment ""2""
- Respondent12: pred:Assessment ""2""
- Respondent5: pred:Assessment ""3""

Looking through each of these, none of the respondents have an Assessment score of 0 or 1. All of them have scores of 2 or 3. Therefore, there are no respondents that meet the criteria of having an Assessment score between 0 and 1.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'Assessment' score is between 0 and 1.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The goal is to find all respondents whose 'Assessment' score is between 0 and 1. 

First, I need to understand what the 'Assessment' question entails. Looking at the questions section, the 'QAssessment' has a rubric where the scores are 0 to 3. The exact text is: ""Makes logical assessment (correlates problem, history, exam, context). [Rubric: 0 = No logical assessment, 1 = Assessment only after extended questioning, 2 = Assessment after minimal questioning, 3 = Comprehensive logical assessment without questioning]"".

So the possible scores are 0, 1, 2, or 3. The task is to find respondents with a score between 0 and 1. That means scores of 0 or 1. However, since the rubric defines 0 and 1 as separate categories, ""between 0 and 1"" might include both. But I need to check if the user means inclusive of 0 and 1. Since the wording is ""between 0 and 1"", sometimes that could be interpreted as greater than 0 and less than 1, but in this context, since the scores are integers, it's more likely they want 0 and 1. But I should confirm. However, given the data, all scores are integers, so 0 and 1 are the only possible scores in that range.

Now, I need to go through each respondent's 'Assessment' score. Let's look at each respondent:

- Respondent20: pred:Assessment ""3"" → 3, which is outside the range.
- Respondent17: pred:Assessment ""3"" → 3, outside.
- Respondent9: pred:Assessment ""2"" → 2, no.
- Respondent12: pred:Assessment ""2"" → 2, no.
- Respondent21: pred:Assessment ""2"" → 2, no.
- Respondent13: pred:Assessment ""2"" → 2, no.
- Respondent3: pred:Assessment ""3"" → 3, no.
- Respondent23: pred:Assessment ""3"" → 3, no.

Wait, none of the respondents have an Assessment score of 0 or 1. Let me double-check each one again to be sure.

Looking again:

- Respondent3 has pred:Assessment ""3"" → 3.
- All others have 2 or 3. So there are no respondents with an Assessment score of 0 or 1. Therefore, the answer should be an empty list.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents from the 'MI' session whose 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is exactly 0.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to list all respondents from the 'MI' session whose 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is exactly 0. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The data has a 'questions' section that defines each predicate, and a 'responses' section with individual respondents. The key here is to correctly interpret the 'SessionName' and the 'Recommendation_global_rating_scale' values.

Looking at the 'Recommendation_global_rating_scale' in the questions, it's a rubric where 0 means ""Not at all confident"". So, I need to find respondents where this value is exactly ""0"".

Next, the session name is 'MI'. But I need to check how the session names are recorded in the responses. Let's look through each respondent's 'SessionName':

- Respondent15: ""III - Sepsis""
- Respondent19: ""I - MI""
- Respondent8: ""III (Sepsis)""
- Respondent21: ""I (Myocardial infarction)""
- Respondent10: ""(MI)-VT""
- Respondent3: ""III-Sepsis""
- Respondent2: ""MI""
- Respondent18: ""IV - VT""
- Respondent7: ""III-Sepsis""
- Respondent23: ""II-Anaphylaxsis""
- Respondent14: ""IV-Hypoglycemia""

The task specifies the 'MI' session. However, the session names vary. For example, Respondent19 has ""I - MI"", Respondent21 has ""I (Myocardial infarction)"", Respondent10 has ""(MI)-VT"", and Respondent2 has ""MI"". The problem is whether these variations are considered part of the 'MI' session. The original task in the example was looking for '(MI)-VT', but the current task is for 'MI' session. So, perhaps the user wants exact matches to 'MI' or sessions that include 'MI' in their name. But the example in the problem statement might clarify this. Wait, the user's example in the <example> section had the task: ""List all respondents from the '(MI)-VT' session whose 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is exactly 0."" The answer was empty, meaning no respondents matched. Now, the current task is similar but for 'MI' session. 

But in the data, the session names that include 'MI' are:

- Respondent19: ""I - MI""
- Respondent21: ""I (Myocardial infarction)"" (Myocardial infarction is MI)
- Respondent10: ""(MI)-VT""
- Respondent2: ""MI""

But the task says 'MI' session. So perhaps the user is looking for sessions named exactly 'MI', not variations. So Respondent2's session is ""MI"", which is an exact match. Respondent19's session is ""I - MI"", which includes 'MI' but isn't exactly 'MI'. Similarly, Respondent10's session is ""(MI)-VT"", which is different. So the exact match would only be Respondent2.

Now, check the 'Recommendation_global_rating_scale' for these candidates. 

Looking at Respondent2: pred:Recommendation_global_rating_scale ""1"". So that's not 0. 

Wait, so even if the session is 'MI', their rating is 1, not 0. Are there any other respondents in the 'MI' session (exact name) with a global rating scale of 0? Let's check all respondents again.

Looking through all respondents:

- Respondent2: SessionName ""MI"", Recommendation_global_rating_scale ""1""
- Respondent10: SessionName ""(MI)-VT"", which is different from 'MI', so not included
- Respondent19: ""I - MI"" – not exact
- Respondent21: ""I (Myocardial infarction)"" – MI is the abbreviation, but session name is spelled out, so maybe not considered as 'MI' session here unless the data uses abbreviations. But according to the data, the session names are as written. For example, Respondent21's session is ""I (Myocardial infarction)"", which is different from ""MI"". 

So, the only exact match for SessionName ""MI"" is Respondent2. But their global rating scale is 1, not 0. Therefore, there are no respondents in the 'MI' session with a global rating scale of exactly 0. 

Wait, but let me double-check all respondents again to ensure I didn't miss any. Let's go through each one:

- Respondent15: SessionName ""III - Sepsis"" – no
- Respondent19: ""I - MI"" – no (not exact)
- Respondent8: ""III (Sepsis)"" – no
- Respondent21: ""I (Myocardial infarction)"" – no
- Respondent10: ""(MI)-VT"" – no
- Respondent3: ""III-Sepsis"" – no
- Respondent2: ""MI"" – yes, but rating 1
- Respondent18: ""IV - VT"" – no
- Respondent7: ""III-Sepsis"" – no
- Respondent23: ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" – no
- Respondent14: ""IV-Hypoglycemia"" – no

So, no one in the exact 'MI' session has a global rating scale of 0. Therefore, the answer should be an empty list.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents from the 'V (Hypoglycemia)' session whose 'Background (examination)' is exactly 1.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The user wants a list of respondents from the 'V (Hypoglycemia)' session with a 'Background (examination)' score of exactly 1. 

First, I need to make sure I understand the data structure. The 'Background (examination)' refers to the predicate pred:Background_examination in the responses. The question schema for this is ""Gives appropriate examination/observations. [Rubric: 0 = Observations are omitted or irrelevant, 1 = Observations reported but frequent clarification needed, 2 = Observations reported with few further questions needed, 3 = Comprehensive focused examination/observations]"". So the value we're looking for is ""1"", which corresponds to ""Observations reported but frequent clarification needed"".

Next, I need to filter respondents who are part of the 'V (Hypoglycemia)' session. The session name is stored under pred:SessionName. Looking through the responses:

- Respondent1 has pred:SessionName ""V (Hypoglycemia)"". Let's check their Background_examination. They have pred:Background_examination ""2"". So that's a 2, which doesn't match the required 1.

Other respondents: Let's check each one. 

- Respondent2: SessionName ""MI"" – not relevant.
- Respondent3: ""III-Sepsis"" – nope.
- Respondent9: ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"" – no.
- Respondent18: ""IV - VT"" – no.
- Respondent19: ""I - MI"" – no.
- Respondent23: ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" – no.
- Respondent6: ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"" – no.
- Respondent11: ""IV (AF)"" – no.

Only Respondent1 is in 'V (Hypoglycemia)', but their Background_examination is 2. So there are no respondents in that session with a score of exactly 1. Therefore, the answer should be an empty list.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents from the 'I (Myocardial infarction)' session whose 'Background (examination)' is exactly 3.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to list all respondents from the 'I (Myocardial infarction)' session whose 'Background (examination)' is exactly 3. 

First, I need to understand the data structure provided. The data includes several respondents with various attributes. The key here is to correctly identify the session name and the background examination score for each respondent.

Looking at the 'Questions' section, the 'QSessionName' is an open-ended question asking for the name of the session. The 'QBackground_examination' has a rubric where 3 means ""Comprehensive focused examination/observations"". So, I need to find respondents where the SessionName exactly matches 'I (Myocardial infarction)' and their Background_examination score is 3.

Now, checking each respondent in the 'Responses' section:

- **Respondent21**: SessionName is ""I (Myocardial infarction)"", Background_examination is ""1"". So, this doesn't meet the criteria because the score is 1, not 3.
  
- **Respondent9**: SessionName is ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"", so it's a different session. Skip.
  
- **Respondent15**: SessionName is ""III - Sepsis"". Different session. Skip.
  
- **Respondent16**: SessionName is ""I - MI"". Hmm, the session name here is ""I - MI"". The task specifies 'I (Myocardial infarction)'. Are these considered the same? The original data shows that Respondent21's session is ""I (Myocardial infarction)"", while Respondent16's is ""I - MI"". Since MI stands for Myocardial Infarction, but the session names are written differently. The task asks for exact match to 'I (Myocardial infarction)', so ""I - MI"" might not be considered the same. However, sometimes abbreviations are used, but the problem states ""exactly"" so we need to match the string exactly. Therefore, Respondent16's session name is ""I - MI"", which is different from ""I (Myocardial infarction)"", so they should be excluded. Their Background_examination is 3, but the session name doesn't match exactly.
  
- **Respondent8**: SessionName is ""III (Sepsis)"". Different session. Skip.

So, after checking all respondents, none have both the exact session name 'I (Myocardial infarction)' and a Background_examination score of 3. The only respondent in the correct session (Respondent21) has a score of 1, and the one with score 3 (Respondent16) is in a differently named session. Therefore, the answer should be an empty list.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents from the 'II - Anaphylaxsis' session whose 'Background (examination)' is exactly 1.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The goal is to list all respondents from the 'II - Anaphylaxsis' session who have a 'Background (examination)' score of exactly 1. 

First, I need to make sure I understand the data structure. The 'questions' section defines each field. The 'Background (examination)' corresponds to the predicate pred:Background_examination, which has a rubric. The responses are under each respondent with their respective values.

Looking at the task, the session name is 'II - Anaphylaxsis'. I need to check each respondent's SessionName value. Also, their Background_examination should be exactly 1.

Now, let's go through each respondent in the data:

- **Respondent3**: SessionName is ""III-Sepsis"". Not matching. Background_examination is 3. So, no.
- **Respondent9**: SessionName is ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"". The task specifies ""II - Anaphylaxsis"". The parentheses and hyphen might be different, but maybe it's a typo or variation. However, the Background_examination here is 2. So even if the session name is considered a match, the score is 2. Doesn't meet the criteria.
- **Respondent5**: SessionName is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"". Exact match. Background_examination is 3. So, score is not 1. Exclude.
- **Respondent13**: SessionName is ""I-VF"". Not relevant. Background_examination is 1, but session doesn't match.
- **Respondent21**: SessionName is ""I (Myocardial infarction)"". Not matching. Background_examination is 1, but session is different.
- **Respondent20**: SessionName is ""IV (VT)"". Not matching. Background_examination is -1. Doesn't apply.

Wait, the task is looking for 'II - Anaphylaxsis' session. Only Respondent5 has that exact SessionName. But their Background_examination is 3. The other respondent in a similar session is Respondent9 with ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"", but the formatting is different. The task specifies the exact session name, so variations in parentheses or hyphens might matter. Assuming the user is strict about the session name, only Respondent5's session matches exactly. However, his Background_examination is 3. 

Looking for Background_examination exactly 1. The only respondents with that are Respondent13 (1) and Respondent21 (1), but their sessions are ""I-VF"" and ""I (Myocardial infarction)"" respectively. So none of the respondents in the 'II - Anaphylaxsis' session have a Background_examination of 1. 

Therefore, the answer should be that there are no respondents meeting both criteria.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents from the 'MI' session whose 'Background (history)' is exactly 0.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The question is asking to list all respondents from the 'MI' session whose 'Background (history)' is exactly 0. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The data has a 'questions' section that defines each field and a 'responses' section with individual respondent data. 

Looking at the 'questions' section, the 'Background_history' is defined as ""Gives appropriate history. [Rubric: 0 = History is unstructured or non-relevant, 1 = Relevant history but frequent clarification needed, 2 = Relevant history with few further questions needed, 3 = Comprehensive focused history]"". So the 'Background_history' corresponds to the 'QBackground_history' predicate.

Next, the task is to find respondents in the 'MI' session. The session names are under the 'pred:SessionName' predicate. The user specified 'MI' session, so I need to check which respondents have 'pred:SessionName' exactly matching ""MI"". However, I should also check for any possible variations, like ""MI"" vs. ""(MI)-VT"" or ""I (Myocardial infarction)"", but according to the task, it's specifically 'MI' session. 

Now, looking at the responses:

- Respondent12: SessionName ""II (Anaphylaxis)""
- Respondent4: ""III (Sepsis)""
- Respondent3: ""III-Sepsis""
- Respondent1: ""V (Hypoglycemia)""
- Respondent10: ""(MI)-VT""
- Respondent15: ""III - Sepsis""
- Respondent23: ""II-Anaphylaxsis""
- Respondent9: ""II (Anaphylaxsis)""
- Respondent2: ""MI""
- Respondent21: ""I (Myocardial infarction)""

Only Respondent2 has SessionName exactly ""MI"". 

Now, check Respondent2's 'Background_history' value. The 'Background_history' is the value for pred:Background_history. Respondent2 has pred:Background_history ""2"". The task requires exactly 0. Since 2 is not 0, Respondent2 doesn't meet the criteria. 

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check. The task says 'Background (history)' is exactly 0. The 'Background_history' in the data is the 'QBackground_history' which is the 'Gives appropriate history' question. So the value for each respondent's pred:Background_history is the score. 

Looking through all respondents in the 'MI' session (only Respondent2), their Background_history is 2, which doesn't match. Are there any other respondents in sessions that might be considered 'MI'? For example, Respondent10 has SessionName ""(MI)-VT"", which includes 'MI' but isn't exactly 'MI'. The task specifies the session name as 'MI', so variations like ""(MI)-VT"" or ""I (Myocardial infarction)"" shouldn't be included. 

Therefore, there are no respondents in the 'MI' session with a Background_history of exactly 0. The answer should be an empty list.

Similarly, 'Recommendation_global_rating_scale' is the GRS question, also on a 0-3 scale.

Now, looking at the responses, I need to filter them based on two criteria: the date, the clear recommendation score, and the GRS score. Let's go through each respondent one by one.

Starting with Respondent6: Their date is 2025-04-04, which doesn't match the target date of 2025-05-04. So they're out.

Respondent14's date is 2025-03-14, also not matching. Next.

Respondent15: Date is 2025-05-04. Check their clear recommendation score: 2. The requirement is 1, so this doesn't fit. GRS is 2, which is not less than 2. So no.

Respondent18: Date is 2025-05-04. Clear recommendation is 2, GRS is 2. Still doesn't meet the criteria.

Respondent20: Date is 2025-05-02. Not the target date. Exclude.

Respondent17: Date is 2025-05-04. Clear recommendation is 3, which is higher than needed. GRS is 2. Doesn't fit.

Wait, none of the respondents on 2025-05-04 have a clear recommendation of 1. Let me double-check. The possible respondents on that date are Respondent15, 18, and 17. 

Looking again:
- Respondent15: Recommendation_clear_recommendation is 2.
- Respondent18: Also 2.
- Respondent17: 3.

So none of them have a clear recommendation score of 1. Therefore, there are no respondents that meet both criteria. The answer should be an empty list.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondents from sessions on '2025-03-14' have a 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' of 3 and a 'Identification' of less than 2?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The question is asking which respondents from the sessions on '2025-03-14' have a 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' of 3 and an 'Identification' score of less than 2. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The data has a list of respondents, each with various properties. The key properties here are the Date, SessionName, Recommendation_global_rating_scale, and Identification. 

Starting with the date: the task specifies '2025-03-14'. I'll look through each respondent's Date field to see which ones match this date. From the data, I see that Respondent13 and Respondent7 have the date ""2025-03-14"".

Next, check the SessionName for these respondents. But wait, the task doesn't specify a particular session name, just the date. So all respondents on that date are candidates as long as they meet the other criteria.

Now, for each of these respondents, I need to check two things: their Recommendation_global_rating_scale and Identification scores. 

The 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' corresponds to the pred:Recommendation_global_rating_scale property. The question requires this to be exactly 3. 

The 'Identification' score is from pred:Identification. The task says it should be less than 2. 

Looking at Respondent13: 
- pred:Recommendation_global_rating_scale is ""2"". 
- pred:Identification is ""3"". 
So this doesn't meet the criteria because the rating scale is 2 (needs to be 3) and Identification is 3 (needs to be less than 2).

Respondent7: 
- pred:Recommendation_global_rating_scale is ""2"". 
- pred:Identification is ""3"". 
Again, both values don't meet the required criteria. 

Wait, are there any other respondents with the date 2025-03-14? Let me check again. The data lists Respondent13 and Respondent7 as the only ones with that date. 

So neither of them have a Recommendation_global_rating_scale of 3. Also, their Identification scores are 3, which is not less than 2. Therefore, there are no respondents that meet both conditions on that date. 

The answer should be an empty list.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondents from sessions on '2025-05-04' have a 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' of 2 and a 'Situation' of less than 2?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The task is to find respondents from sessions on '2025-05-04' who have a 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' of exactly 2 and a 'Situation' score of less than 2. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The questions section defines each predicate. The 'Recommendation_clear_recommendation' corresponds to the question about making a clear recommendation, with a rubric from 0 to 3. The 'Situation' predicate relates to identifying the main problem(s), also on a 0-3 scale.

Now, looking at the responses. I need to filter respondents based on two dates: '2025-05-04'. Let's check each respondent's date. 

Looking at the data:

- Respondent12: Date is 2025-05-02. Not our target.
- Respondent9: Date is 2025-05-04. This is a candidate.
- Respondent8: 2025-05-02. Not.
- Respondent16: 2025-05-02. No.
- Respondent7: 2025-03-14. No.
- Respondent15: 2025-05-04. Another candidate.

So, potential respondents are 9 and 15.

Next, check their 'Recommendation_clear_recommendation' and 'Situation' scores.

For Respondent9:
- Recommendation_clear_recommendation is ""3"". The task requires exactly 2. So this doesn't meet the criteria.

For Respondent15:
- Recommendation_clear_recommendation is ""2"". That's good.
- Situation score is ""3"". The task requires 'Situation' less than 2. So 3 is not less than 2. So this also doesn't meet the criteria.

Wait, that's confusing. Let me double-check. The task says 'Situation' of less than 2. So scores 0 or 1. Both respondents 9 and 15 have 'Situation' scores of 3. So neither of them meet the 'Situation' condition. 

Are there any other respondents with date 2025-05-04? Let me check again. Respondent9 and 15 are the only ones. Both have 'Situation' scores of 3. So no one meets both conditions. Therefore, the answer should be an empty list.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondents from sessions on '2025-05-16' have a 'Background (history)' of 3 and a 'Background (examination)' of less than 2?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The question is asking for respondents from sessions on '2025-05-16' who have a 'Background (history)' of exactly 3 and a 'Background (examination)' of less than 2. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The 'questions' section defines each field. The 'Background (history)' corresponds to the predicate pred:Background_history, and the rubric for it is a scale from 0 to 3. Similarly, 'Background (examination)' is pred:Background_examination, also on a 0-3 scale.

Now, looking at the responses, I need to filter respondents based on three criteria:
1. Date is '2025-05-16'
2. Background_history is exactly 3
3. Background_examination is less than 2 (i.e., 0 or 1)

Let's go through each respondent:

- **Respondent5**: Date is 2025-05-04. Doesn't match the date, so skip.
- **Respondent10**: Date is 2025-03-14. Not the right date.
- **Respondent1**: Date 2025-05-02. Nope.
- **Respondent13**: Date 2025-03-14. No.
- **Respondent11**: Date 2025-04-04. Not matching.
- **Respondent20**: Date 2025-05-02. Still not.
- **Respondent19**: Date is 2025-05-16. This matches the date. Now check the background scores. Background_history is 3, and Background_examination is 3. Wait, 3 is not less than 2. So this doesn't meet the criteria.
- **Respondent15**: Date 2025-05-04. Not the right date.

Wait, did I miss anyone else? Let me check again. The only respondent with the date 2025-05-16 is Respondent19. But their Background_examination is 3, which is not less than 2. So there are no respondents that meet all three criteria. Therefore, the answer should be none.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents whose 'Identification' score is equal to their 'Background (history)' score.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents whose 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is within 1 point of the lowest 'Assessment' for their session name.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondents have a total score across all rubric items that is higher than the average total score for all respondents?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find which respondents have a total score across all rubric items that's higher than the average total score for all respondents. 

First, I need to identify which predicates in the responses are rubric items. Looking at the questions section, the rubric items are the ones with the ""[Rubric: ...]"" descriptions. These are:

- QIdentification (0-3)
- QSituation (0-3)
- QBackground_history (0-3)
- QBackground_examination (0-3)
- QAssessment (0-3)
- QRecommendation_clear_recommendation (0-3)
- QRecommendation_global_rating_scale (0-3)

So each respondent has seven rubric items, each scored from 0 to 3. The total score for each respondent would be the sum of these seven values.

Next, I need to calculate the total score for each respondent. Let's go through each one:

**Respondent17:**
- Identification: 3
- Situation: 3
- Background_history: 3
- Background_examination: 3
- Assessment: 3
- Recommendation_clear_recommendation: 3
- Recommendation_global_rating_scale: 2
Total = 3+3+3+3+3+3+2 = 20

**Respondent6:**
- 3 + 2 +3 +3 +2 +2 +3 = 3+2=5, +3=8, +3=11, +2=13, +2=15, +3=18. Total 18.

**Respondent18:**
- 3 +3 +2 +2 +3 +2 +2 = 3+3=6, +2=8, +2=10, +3=13, +2=15, +2=17. Total 17.

**Respondent22:**
- 3 +3 +3 +3 +2 +2 +3 = 3+3=6, +3=9, +3=12, +2=14, +2=16, +3=19. Total 19.

**Respondent11:**
- 3 +3 +3 +3 +3 +3 +3 = 21.

**Respondent21:**
- 3 +2 +3 +1 +2 +3 +3 = 3+2=5, +3=8, +1=9, +2=11, +3=14, +3=17. Total 17.

**Respondent14:**
- 3 +3 +2 +2 +3 +1 +2 = 3+3=6, +2=8, +2=10, +3=13, +1=14, +2=16. Total 16.

**Respondent15:**
- 3 +3 +2 +3 +2 +2 +2 = 3+3=6, +2=8, +3=11, +2=13, +2=15, +2=17. Total 17.

**Respondent4:**
- 3 +3 +3 +2 +2 +2 +2 = 3+3=6, +3=9, +2=11, +2=13, +2=15, +2=17. Total 17.

Now, let's list all totals:
- 17: 20
- 6: 18
- 18:17
- 22:19
- 11:21
- 21:17
- 14:16
- 15:17
- 4:17

So the totals are: 20, 18, 17, 19, 21, 17, 16, 17, 17.

Next, calculate the average total score. Sum all totals and divide by 9.

Sum = 20 +18 +17 +19 +21 +17 +16 +17 +17 = Let's add step by step:

20 +18 = 38
38 +17 =55
55 +19=74
74 +21=95
95 +17=112
112 +16=128
128 +17=145
145 +17=162

Total sum is 162. Average = 162 /9 = 18.

So the average total score is 18.

Now, find which respondents have a total higher than 18. Looking at the totals:

- Respondent17: 20 >18 → yes
- Respondent6: 18 → no (equal)
- Respondent18:17 → no
- Respondent22:19 >18 → yes
- Respondent11:21 >18 → yes
- Others are 17 or 16 → no.

So the respondents with total scores above average (18) are 17, 22, and 11. Their IDs are :Respondent17, :Respondent22, :Respondent11. The answer should be the list of their numbers: 11,17,22.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'Background (examination)' is greater than the average 'Background (examination)' for their session name.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find all respondents whose 'Background (examination)' score is greater than the average for their respective session names. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The 'Background_examination' predicate in the responses corresponds to the question about giving appropriate examination/observations, with a rubric from 0 to 3. Each respondent is part of a session, identified by 'SessionName'. 

So, the plan is:
1. Calculate the average 'Background_examination' score for each session.
2. For each respondent, compare their 'Background_examination' score to the average of their session.
3. List all respondents where their score is higher than the session's average.

Let's start by listing all the sessions and their respondents. Looking at the data:

- Session ""II-Anaphylaxsis"": Respondent23
- Session ""III-Sepsis"": Respondent7
- Session ""IV (VT)"": Respondent22
- Session ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"": Respondent9
- Session ""III-Sepsis"": Respondent3 (Wait, no, Respondent3's SessionName is ""III-Sepsis"" but the date is different. Wait, no, the SessionName for Respondent3 is ""III-Sepsis"", same as Respondent7. So sessions with the same name but different dates might be considered the same session? The problem says ""their session name"", so sessions are grouped by the SessionName regardless of date. So all respondents with the same SessionName are in the same group, even if dates differ.

Wait, looking at the data:

- Respondent23: SessionName ""II-Anaphylaxsis""
- Respondent7: ""III-Sepsis""
- Respondent22: ""IV (VT)""
- Respondent9: ""II (Anaphylaxsis)""
- Respondent3: ""III-Sepsis""
- Respondent4: ""III (Sepsis)""
- Respondent6: ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)""
- Respondent12: ""II (Anaphylaxis)""

Hmm, the session names have variations. For example, ""III-Sepsis"" vs. ""III (Sepsis)""—are these considered the same session? The problem states to group by the session name as given. So ""III-Sepsis"" and ""III (Sepsis)"" are different session names. Similarly, ""II-Anaphylaxsis"", ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"", ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"", ""II (Anaphylaxis)""—these are all different session names. So each variation is a separate group.

Wait, but maybe the user intended that sessions with similar names but different formatting (like parentheses vs. hyphens) are considered the same? For example, ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" vs. ""II (Anaphylaxsis)""—but the problem says ""their session name"" exactly. So unless the names are exactly the same, they are different sessions. So we have to treat each unique SessionName string as a separate group.

So first, list all unique SessionNames and their respondents:

1. ""II-Anaphylaxsis"": Respondent23
2. ""III-Sepsis"": Respondent7, Respondent3
3. ""IV (VT)"": Respondent22
4. ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"": Respondent9
5. ""III (Sepsis)"": Respondent4
6. ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"": Respondent6
7. ""II (Anaphylaxis)"": Respondent12

Now, for each of these sessions, calculate the average Background_examination score.

Let's go through each session:

1. Session ""II-Anaphylaxsis"": Only Respondent23. His Background_examination is 2. Average is 2. So any respondent in this session with score >2 would be included, but since there's only one, his score equals the average. So no one here.

2. Session ""III-Sepsis"": Respondents7 and 3. 
   - Respondent7: Background_examination is 3
   - Respondent3: Background_examination is 3
   Average = (3 + 3)/2 = 3. So any respondent in this session with score >3. But both have 3, so none.

3. Session ""IV (VT)"": Respondent22. Score 3. Average 3. No one above.

4. Session ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"": Respondent9. Score 2. Average 2. No.

5. Session ""III (Sepsis)"": Respondent4. Score 2. Average 2. No.

6. Session ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"": Respondent6. Score 3. Average 3. No.

7. Session ""II (Anaphylaxis)"": Respondent12. Score 3. Average 3. No.

Wait, but wait, are there any other sessions with multiple respondents? Let me check again.

Wait, in the data:

Looking at all respondents:

- Respondent23: ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" (score 2)
- Respondent7: ""III-Sepsis"" (3)
- Respondent3: ""III-Sepsis"" (3)
- Respondent22: ""IV (VT)"" (3)
- Respondent9: ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"" (2)
- Respondent4: ""III (Sepsis)"" (2)
- Respondent6: ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"" (3)
- Respondent12: ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" (3)

So the only session with multiple respondents is ""III-Sepsis"" (Respondent7 and 3), both with 3. So average 3. So no one in that group has a score higher than average.

All other sessions have only one respondent, so their score equals the average. Therefore, no respondents have a Background_examination score higher than their session's average.

But wait, let me check again. Are there any sessions where there are multiple respondents with varying scores?

Looking again:

No. All sessions except ""III-Sepsis"" have one respondent each. ""III-Sepsis"" has two, both with 3. So average is 3. So no one in any session has a score higher than the average. Therefore, the answer should be that there are no such respondents.

But wait, maybe I made a mistake in grouping. Let me check the SessionNames again.

Wait, Respondent4's SessionName is ""III (Sepsis)"" with parentheses, which is different from ""III-Sepsis"". So that's a separate session. So in that case, all sessions except ""III-Sepsis"" have one respondent. So no other groups. Therefore, the conclusion is that there are no respondents where their Background_examination is greater than the session's average.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'Assessment' is greater than the average 'Assessment' for their session name.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents whose 'Background (history)' is within 1 point of the lowest 'Identification' for their session name.
