<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to list all respondents from the '(MI)-VT' session whose 'Identification' score is exactly 0. 

First, I need to understand the data structure provided. The dataset has a 'questions' section that defines each question and its possible answers, and a 'responses' section with data from various respondents. 

Looking at the 'SessionName' question, the user is interested in respondents where the session name is exactly '(MI)-VT'. I'll need to check each respondent's 'SessionName' answer to see if it matches this exact string.

Next, the 'Identification' question is scored on a rubric from 0 to 3. The task specifies that we need respondents with an 'Identification' score of exactly 0. So, I'll check each respondent's answer to this question.

Now, I'll go through each respondent in the 'responses' section one by one:

- **Respondent 16**: SessionName is ""I - MI"", which doesn't match. Skip.
- **Respondent 7**: SessionName is ""III-Sepsis"". Doesn't match. Skip.
- **Respondent 11**: SessionName is ""IV (AF)"". Doesn't match. Skip.
- **Respondent 10**: SessionName is ""(MI)-VT"". This matches. Now check 'Identification' score. The answer here is 2. Since we need 0, this respondent doesn't qualify.
- **Respondent 1**: SessionName is ""V (Hypoglycemia)"". Doesn't match. Skip.
- **Respondent 22**: SessionName is ""IV (VT)"". Doesn't match. Skip.
- **Respondent 18**: SessionName is ""IV - VT"". Close, but not exactly '(MI)-VT'. Skip.
- **Respondent 4**: SessionName is ""III (Sepsis)"". Doesn't match. Skip.

After checking all respondents, none of them in the '(MI)-VT' session have an 'Identification' score of 0. The only respondent in that session (Respondent 10) has a score of 2. Therefore, there are no respondents that meet both criteria.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents from the 'MI' session whose 'Assessment' is exactly 2.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to list all respondents from the 'MI' session whose 'Assessment' is exactly 2. 

First, I need to understand the structure of the data provided. The data is in XML format with a questionnaire that includes questions and responses. The questions section defines each question by an ID and the possible rubric or options. The responses section contains individual respondents with their answers to each question.

The key here is to filter the respondents based on two criteria: 
1. Their 'SessionName' must be exactly 'MI'.
2. Their 'Assessment' score must be exactly 2.

Starting with the first criterion, I need to look through each respondent's answer to the 'SessionName' question. The question ID for the session name is ""SessionName"". So, for each respondent, I check the value of the <answer> element where the question attribute is ""SessionName"". The value should be exactly 'MI' (case-sensitive as per the data provided).

Next, for the second criterion, the 'Assessment' score. The question ID for Assessment is ""Assessment"", and the rubric defines the scoring. The task specifies that the score must be exactly 2. So, I need to check each respondent's answer to the ""Assessment"" question and see if it's ""2"".

Now, let's go through each respondent in the responses section:

- Respondent 7: SessionName is ""III-Sepsis"" – not MI. Skip.
- Respondent 12: SessionName is ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" – not MI. Skip.
- Respondent 11: SessionName is ""IV (AF)"" – not MI. Skip.
- Respondent 14: SessionName is ""IV-Hypoglycemia"" – not MI. Skip.
- Respondent 2: SessionName is ""MI"". Now check Assessment. Assessment is 3. So, doesn't meet the second criterion. Skip.
- Respondent 8: SessionName is ""III (Sepsis)"" – not MI. Skip.
- Respondent 5: SessionName is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" – not MI. Skip.
- Respondent 1: SessionName is ""V (Hypoglycemia)"" – not MI. Skip.
- Respondent 17: SessionName is ""V (Hypoglycemia)"" – not MI. Skip.
- Respondent 9: SessionName is ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"" – not MI. Skip.

After checking all respondents, none of them are in the 'MI' session with an Assessment score of exactly 2. The only respondent in the 'MI' session is respondent 2, but their Assessment score is 3, not 2. Therefore, there are no respondents that meet both criteria.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents from the 'II (Anaphylaxis)' session whose 'Identification' is exactly 0.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The question is asking to list all respondents from the 'II (Anaphylaxis)' session whose 'Identification' score is exactly 0. 

First, I need to understand the structure of the data provided. The data is in XML format with a 'questions' section that defines each question and its possible answers, and a 'responses' section containing individual respondents' answers.

Looking at the 'SessionName' question, the task specifies the session name as 'II (Anaphylaxis)'. I need to check each respondent's answer to the 'SessionName' field to see if it matches exactly. However, I should be careful about possible variations in the session names. For example, in the data, there's a respondent with SessionName ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"" which might be a typo for Anaphylaxis. But the exact session name given in the task is 'II (Anaphylaxis)', so I need to check for that exact string.

Next, the 'Identification' field is a rubric where 0 means ""Requires direct prompting"". I need to find respondents in the specified session who have a score of 0 in this field.

Now, let's go through each respondent in the responses:

- Respondent 9: SessionName is ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"" – note the spelling difference. Identification is 3. Doesn't match.
- Respondent 16: SessionName ""I - MI"". Not the target session.
- Respondent 21: SessionName ""I (Myocardial infarction)"". Not the target.
- Respondent 22: SessionName ""IV (VT)"". Not relevant.
- Respondent 15: SessionName ""III - Sepsis"". No.
- Respondent 6: SessionName ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"". Close but not exact. The task specifies 'Anaphylaxis', so this is different.
- Respondent 12: SessionName ""II (Anaphylaxis)"". This matches exactly. Check Identification: their answer is 3. So not 0.
- Respondent 18: SessionName ""IV - VT"". No.
- Respondent 3: SessionName ""III-Sepsis"". No.
- Respondent 17: SessionName ""V (Hypoglycemia)"". No.

Looking through all respondents, none of them in the 'II (Anaphylaxis)' session (exact match) have an Identification score of 0. The only respondent with Identification 0 is respondent 3, but their session is ""III-Sepsis"", which doesn't match. Respondent 6's session is ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"", which is a different session name. Respondent 12 has the correct session name but a score of 3. Therefore, there are no respondents that meet both criteria.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents from the 'III-Sepsis' session whose 'Background (examination)' is exactly 2.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to list all respondents from the 'III-Sepsis' session who have a 'Background (examination)' score of exactly 2. 

First, I need to understand the structure of the data provided. The dataset includes a list of respondents, each with various answers to different questions. The key here is to filter the respondents based on two criteria: their session name and their score in the 'Background (examination)' field.

Starting with the session name. The question specifies the session as 'III-Sepsis'. Looking at the data, I need to check each respondent's answer to the 'SessionName' question. However, I should be careful about possible variations in the session names. For example, in the example given, there was a session named '(MI)-VT', but in the data, there's a session named 'III-Sepsis' and another 'III - Sepsis' (with a space and hyphen). The task here is 'III-Sepsis', so I need to match exactly that, but also check if there are any other similar entries that might be considered the same session but formatted differently. Wait, in the data provided, looking at the responses:

- Respondent 3 has SessionName ""III-Sepsis""
- Respondent 7 has SessionName ""III-Sepsis""
- Respondent 15 has SessionName ""III - Sepsis"" (with spaces around the hyphen)
- Others have different session names like ""II - Anaphylaxsis"", ""V (Hypoglycemia)"", etc.

But the task is specifically looking for 'III-Sepsis', so I need to check if ""III - Sepsis"" (with spaces) is considered the same. However, the exact match is important here. The user specified 'III-Sepsis', so I should only include respondents where the SessionName exactly matches that string. The respondent 15 has ""III - Sepsis"", which is different because of the spaces and the hyphen placement. So, only respondents 3 and 7 are in the 'III-Sepsis' session.

Next, the second criterion is the 'Background (examination)' score of exactly 2. The 'Background (examination)' question's rubric is: 0 = Observations omitted or irrelevant, 1 = Observations reported but frequent clarification needed, 2 = Observations reported with few further questions needed, 3 = Comprehensive focused examination/observations. We need respondents who scored exactly 2 here.

Looking at the respondents in the 'III-Sepsis' session (respondents 3 and 7):

- Respondent 3: Background (examination) is 3.
- Respondent 7: Background (examination) is 3.

Wait, that's not right. Wait, let me check again. The data for respondent 3:

<respondent id=""3"">
  ...
  <answer question=""Background (examination)"">3</answer>
  ...
</respondent>

And respondent 7:

<respondent id=""7"">
  ...
  <answer question=""Background (examination)"">3</answer>
  ...
</respondent>

Wait, both have 3. But the task is looking for a score of exactly 2. So neither of them would qualify. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in identifying the session names. Let me check again.

Wait, the task is to find respondents from 'III-Sepsis' session. The data shows:

Respondent 3: SessionName is ""III-Sepsis""

Respondent 7: SessionName is ""III-Sepsis""

Respondent 15: SessionName is ""III - Sepsis""

So, if the task is looking for exactly 'III-Sepsis', then respondents 3 and 7 are in that session. Now, checking their 'Background (examination)' scores:

Respondent 3: 3

Respondent 7: 3

So both have 3, which is not 2. Therefore, there are no respondents in the 'III-Sepsis' session with a 'Background (examination)' score of 2. But wait, maybe I missed other respondents. Let me check all respondents again.

Looking through all the respondents:

Respondent 3: SessionName III-Sepsis, Background (examination) 3

Respondent 5: SessionName II - Anaphylaxsis

Respondent 1: V (Hypoglycemia)

Respondent 7: III-Sepsis, Background (examination) 3

Respondent 17: V (Hypoglycemia)

Respondent 15: III - Sepsis, Background (examination) 3

Respondent 12: II (Anaphylaxis)

Respondent 2: MI

So, in the 'III-Sepsis' session (exact match), only respondents 3 and 7. Both have Background (examination) 3. Therefore, no one meets the criteria. But wait, maybe there's a respondent in the 'III - Sepsis' session (with spaces) that has a score of 2. Let's check respondent 15:

Respondent 15: SessionName ""III - Sepsis"", Background (examination) 3. Still 3.

Wait, but the task is to look for 'III-Sepsis' exactly. So even if there's a similar session name with spaces, unless the user considers them the same, which they might not. So in this case, no respondents in the exact 'III-Sepsis' session have a Background (examination) of 2. Therefore, the answer should be an empty list.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'Assessment' score is between 0 and 1.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task. I need to find all respondents whose 'Assessment' score is between 0 and 1. First, I should check the schema to understand what the 'Assessment' question entails.

Looking at the questions section, the 'Assessment' question has a rubric: 0 = No logical assessment, 1 = Assessment only after extended questioning, 2 = Assessment after minimal questioning, 3 = Comprehensive logical assessment without questioning. So the possible scores are 0, 1, 2, or 3. The task is to find respondents with a score between 0 and 1, which would include 0 and 1.

Now, I need to go through each respondent in the responses and check their 'Assessment' answer. Let's list them out:

- Respondent 22: Assessment is 2 → Not in range.
- Respondent 16: Assessment is 3 → No.
- Respondent 1: Assessment is 3 → No.
- Respondent 21: Assessment is 2 → No.
- Respondent 18: Assessment is 3 → No.
- Respondent 19: Assessment is 2 → No.
- Respondent 14: Assessment is 3 → No.
- Respondent 20: Assessment is 3 → No.
- Respondent 23: Assessment is 3 → No.
- Respondent 9: Assessment is 2 → No.
- Respondent 12: Assessment is 2 → No.
- Respondent 5: Assessment is 3 → No.

Wait, none of the respondents have an 'Assessment' score of 0 or 1. All of them are 2 or 3. So the answer should be an empty list. Let me double-check each one again to make sure I didn't miss any. 

Looking again, all 'Assessment' answers are either 2 or 3. No 0s or 1s. Therefore, there are no respondents meeting the criteria.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'Assessment' score is between 0 and 1.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The goal is to find all respondents whose 'Assessment' score is between 0 and 1. 

First, I need to understand what the 'Assessment' question entails. Looking at the questions section, the 'Assessment' question has the rubric: 0 = No logical assessment, 1 = Assessment only after extended questioning, 2 = Assessment after minimal questioning, 3 = Comprehensive logical assessment without questioning. So the possible scores are 0, 1, 2, or 3.

The task is to find respondents with a score between 0 and 1. Since these are discrete values, that would include scores of 0 and 1. So any respondent with an 'Assessment' answer of 0 or 1 should be listed.

Now, I'll go through each respondent in the responses section and check their 'Assessment' score.

Looking at respondent id=""20"": Assessment is 3. That's above 1, so no.

Respondent id=""17"": Assessment is 3. No.

Respondent id=""9"": Assessment is 2. No.

Respondent id=""12"": Assessment is 2. No.

Respondent id=""21"": Assessment is 2. No.

Respondent id=""13"": Assessment is 2. No.

Respondent id=""3"": Assessment is 3. No.

Respondent id=""23"": Assessment is 3. No.

Wait, none of the respondents have an 'Assessment' score of 0 or 1. Let me double-check each one again to make sure I didn't miss any.

Looking again:

- id=""20"": 3
- id=""17"": 3
- id=""9"": 2
- id=""12"": 2
- id=""21"": 2
- id=""13"": 2
- id=""3"": 3
- id=""23"": 3

All of them have scores of 2 or 3. So there are no respondents with an 'Assessment' score between 0 and 1. Therefore, the answer should be an empty list.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents from the 'MI' session whose 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is exactly 0.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to list all respondents from the 'MI' session whose 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is exactly 0. 

First, I need to understand the structure of the data provided. The data is in XML format, with a list of questions and responses. Each respondent has an ID and various answers corresponding to the questions.

Starting with the questions section, the 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' has a rubric where 0 means ""Not at all confident"". So, I need to find respondents where this value is exactly 0. 

Next, the session name is 'MI'. Looking at the responses, each respondent has a 'SessionName' answer. I need to check which respondents have a SessionName exactly matching 'MI'. However, I should be careful about variations in the session names. For example, in the example provided, there was a session named '(MI)-VT' which wasn't considered a match for 'MI'. So, exact string matching is crucial here.

Now, I'll go through each respondent in the responses section:

- Respondent 15: SessionName is ""III - Sepsis"". Not MI. GRS is 2. Doesn't match.
- Respondent 19: SessionName ""I - MI"". Wait, the task is looking for 'MI' session. But in the example, the session named '(MI)-VT' wasn't considered a match. So, does ""I - MI"" count? The example might suggest that only exact matches to 'MI' are considered. But the task here is for the current data. Let me check the current data's responses.

Looking at the current data's responses:

- Respondent 2: SessionName is ""MI"". That's an exact match. Their GRS is 1. So not 0.
- Respondent 10: SessionName is ""(MI)-VT"". Not exact match. GRS 2.
- Respondent 19: SessionName ""I - MI"". Not exact. 
- Respondent 21: ""I (Myocardial infarction)"". Not MI.
- Others: Sepsis, VT, Hypoglycemia, etc.

So, the only respondent with SessionName exactly 'MI' is respondent 2. But their GRS is 1, not 0. 

Wait, are there any other respondents with SessionName variations that might be considered 'MI'? For example, ""I - MI"" or ""Myocardial infarction""? The task specifies the session name as 'MI', so I think only exact matches count. 

Looking through all respondents again:

- Respondent 2: SessionName ""MI"" → GRS 1.
- Any others? Let me check again.

No, others have different session names. So, there are no respondents in the 'MI' session with GRS exactly 0. Therefore, the answer should be an empty list.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents from the 'V (Hypoglycemia)' session whose 'Background (examination)' is exactly 1.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to list all respondents from the 'V (Hypoglycemia)' session whose 'Background (examination)' score is exactly 1. 

First, I need to understand the structure of the data provided. The data is in XML format with a questionnaire that includes questions and responses. The questions section defines each question's ID and the possible answers or rubric. The responses section contains individual respondents with their answers to each question.

The key here is to filter the respondents based on two criteria: 
1. Their 'SessionName' must be exactly 'V (Hypoglycemia)'.
2. Their 'Background (examination)' score must be exactly 1.

Starting with the first criterion, I'll look through each respondent's 'SessionName' answer. The session names are in the 'SessionName' question's answers. The specific session we're interested in is 'V (Hypoglycemia)'. 

Next, for each respondent in that session, I need to check their 'Background (examination)' score. The 'Background (examination)' question has a rubric where the score 1 means ""Observations reported but frequent clarification needed"". So, we need respondents who have exactly 1 in that field.

Looking at the responses:

- Respondent id=""1"" has SessionName ""V (Hypoglycemia)"". Let's check their 'Background (examination)' score. The answer there is 2. So this doesn't meet the second criterion.
- Other respondents have different SessionNames. For example, respondent 2 is in ""MI"", 3 in ""III-Sepsis"", 9 in ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"", 18 in ""IV - VT"", 19 in ""I - MI"", 23 in ""II-Anaphylaxsis"", 6 in ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"", 11 in ""IV (AF)"". 

None of the other respondents are in the 'V (Hypoglycemia)' session except respondent 1. However, their 'Background (examination)' is 2, not 1. Therefore, there are no respondents that meet both criteria.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
List all respondents from the 'I (Myocardial infarction)' session whose 'Background (examination)' is exactly 3.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to list all respondents from the 'I (Myocardial infarction)' session whose 'Background (examination)' score is exactly 3. 

First, I need to understand the structure of the data provided. The data is in XML format with a questionnaire that includes questions and responses. The questions section defines each question's ID and the possible answers, while the responses section contains the actual answers from each respondent.

Looking at the questions, the 'Background (examination)' has a rubric where 0 is the lowest and 3 is the highest. The task is to find respondents in the session named 'I (Myocardial infarction)' who scored exactly 3 in this category.

Now, I'll go through each respondent in the responses section. Each respondent has an ID and answers to various questions. The key here is to check two things for each respondent: 
1. The 'SessionName' must be exactly 'I (Myocardial infarction)'.
2. The 'Background (examination)' answer must be '3'.

Starting with respondent 21: Their SessionName is ""I (Myocardial infarction)"", which matches. The Background (examination) is 1, so they don't qualify.

Next, respondent 9: SessionName is ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"", so not relevant.

Respondent 15: SessionName is ""III - Sepsis"", so skip.

Respondent 16: SessionName is ""I - MI"". Wait, the task specifies 'I (Myocardial infarction)'. The session name here is ""I - MI"". MI stands for Myocardial Infarction, but the session name is written differently. The original example in the data shows that respondent 21's SessionName is ""I (Myocardial infarction)"", while respondent 16's is ""I - MI"". Are these considered the same session? The task is looking for the exact session name 'I (Myocardial infarction)', so ""I - MI"" might be a different entry. Therefore, respondent 16's session name doesn't exactly match, so they are excluded.

Respondent 8: SessionName is ""III (Sepsis)"", so not relevant.

Now, checking the Background (examination) scores for the matching session. Only respondent 21 is in the correct session, but their score is 1. No other respondents have the exact session name and a score of 3. Therefore, there are no respondents that meet both criteria.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents from the 'II - Anaphylaxsis' session whose 'Background (examination)' is exactly 1.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to list all respondents from the 'II - Anaphylaxsis' session whose 'Background (examination)' score is exactly 1. 

First, I need to understand the structure of the data provided. The XML data has a 'questions' section that defines each question and their possible answers, and a 'responses' section with the actual data from each respondent. 

The key here is to filter the respondents based on two criteria: their session name and their score in 'Background (examination)'. 

Starting with the session name: the task specifies 'II - Anaphylaxsis'. Looking at the responses, I need to check each respondent's answer to the 'SessionName' question. Let's go through each respondent one by one.

Respondent 3: SessionName is ""III-Sepsis"" – doesn't match.
Respondent 9: SessionName is ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"" – the name here is similar but uses parentheses instead of a dash. The task specifies ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" with a dash. Hmm, but maybe there's a typo or variation in naming. Need to check if this is considered the same session. The exact match is important here. Since the task says exactly 'II - Anaphylaxsis', respondent 9's session name is written with parentheses, so it's a different format. But perhaps the user intended it to be considered the same? Wait, looking at the data, respondent 5 has SessionName ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" which matches exactly. So respondent 5 is part of the target session. 

Next, check the 'Background (examination)' score for each respondent in the correct session. 

For respondent 5: The 'Background (examination)' answer is 3. The task requires exactly 1, so this doesn't qualify. 

Now, are there other respondents in the 'II - Anaphylaxsis' session? Let's check the others. 

Respondent 9's session is ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"" – different formatting. Respondent 13: ""I-VF"", 21: ""I (Myocardial infarction)"", 20: ""IV (VT)"". So only respondent 5 has the exact session name as specified. 

But wait, the task says 'II - Anaphylaxsis', and respondent 5's SessionName is exactly that. Now, check their 'Background (examination)' score. It's 3, which is not 1. So even though they are in the correct session, their score doesn't meet the criteria. 

Are there any other respondents in that session? Let me double-check. The data has 6 respondents: 3,9,5,13,21,20. Only respondent 5 has the exact session name. 

Wait, but maybe the session names might have variations. For example, respondent 9's session is ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"" which might be considered the same session but written differently. However, the task specifically says 'II - Anaphylaxsis', so unless there's a typo or the user considers different formats as the same, we should stick to exact matches. 

Assuming exact match is required, only respondent 5 is in the correct session. But their 'Background (examination)' is 3, not 1. Therefore, there are no respondents in the 'II - Anaphylaxsis' session with a 'Background (examination)' score of exactly 1. 

Wait, but let me check all respondents again for 'Background (examination)' score of 1. Looking through each:

Respondent 3: 3
Respondent 9: 2
Respondent 5:3
Respondent13:1
Respondent21:1
Respondent20:-1

So respondents 13 and 21 have 'Background (examination)' scores of 1. But their session names are ""I-VF"" and ""I (Myocardial infarction)"" respectively. Neither is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"". 

Therefore, even though they have the correct score, they are not in the specified session. 

So the final answer is that there are no respondents meeting both criteria. The list should be empty.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents from the 'MI' session whose 'Background (history)' is exactly 0.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to list all respondents from the 'MI' session whose 'Background (history)' is exactly 0. 

First, I need to understand the data structure provided. The data is in XML format with a questionnaire that includes questions and responses. The questions section defines each question's ID and the possible answers, while the responses section contains the actual data from each respondent.

Looking at the task, there are two main criteria:
1. The respondent must be part of the 'MI' session.
2. Their 'Background (history)' score must be exactly 0.

Starting with the first criterion: identifying respondents in the 'MI' session. I'll go through each respondent in the responses section and check their 'SessionName' answer. The SessionName question is identified by the ID ""SessionName"". 

Next, for each respondent in the 'MI' session, I need to check their 'Background (history)' score. The 'Background (history)' question has the ID ""Background (history)"", and the value should be exactly 0 according to the rubric provided in the questions section.

Now, let's look at each respondent one by one:

- **Respondent id=""12""**: SessionName is ""II (Anaphylaxis)"". Not MI. Skip.
- **Respondent id=""4""**: SessionName is ""III (Sepsis)"". Not MI. Skip.
- **Respondent id=""3""**: SessionName is ""III-Sepsis"". Not MI. Skip.
- **Respondent id=""1""**: SessionName is ""V (Hypoglycemia)"". Not MI. Skip.
- **Respondent id=""10""**: SessionName is ""(MI)-VT"". This includes ""MI"" but the exact session name is ""(MI)-VT"", not just ""MI"". The task specifies 'MI' session, so this might be a different session. Need to check if ""(MI)-VT"" is considered part of 'MI' sessions. However, the example given in the problem shows that the user is looking for exact matches. For instance, in the example, the session name was '(MI)-VT' and the answer was an empty list. So perhaps the task requires exact match. Therefore, ""(MI)-VT"" is not the same as ""MI"".
- **Respondent id=""15""**: SessionName is ""III - Sepsis"". Not MI. Skip.
- **Respondent id=""23""**: SessionName is ""II-Anaphylaxsis"". Not MI. Skip.
- **Respondent id=""9""**: SessionName is ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"". Not MI. Skip.
- **Respondent id=""2""**: SessionName is ""MI"". This matches exactly. Now check their 'Background (history)' score. The answer for ""Background (history)"" is 2. So this doesn't meet the second criterion.
- **Respondent id=""21""**: SessionName is ""I (Myocardial infarction)"". This includes ""Myocardial infarction"" which is MI, but the session name is written as ""I (Myocardial infarction)"", not ""MI"". So this is a different session name. 

So, the only respondent with SessionName exactly ""MI"" is respondent 2. However, their 'Background (history)' score is 2, not 0. Therefore, there are no respondents in the 'MI' session with a 'Background (history)' score of exactly 0.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondents from sessions on '2025-05-04' have a 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' of 1 and a 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' of less than 2?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find which respondents from sessions on '2025-05-04' have a 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' of 1 and a 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' of less than 2. 

First, I need to parse the data provided. The data is in XML format, with a list of questions and responses. The responses are under the <responses> tag, each with a respondent id. 

I'll start by filtering the respondents based on the date. The date in question is '2025-05-04'. Looking through each respondent's 'Date' answer:

- Respondent 6: 2025-04-04 → Not our target date.
- Respondent 14: 2025-03-14 → No.
- Respondent 15: 2025-05-04 → Yes.
- Respondent 18: 2025-05-04 → Yes.
- Respondent 20: 2025-05-02 → No.
- Respondent 17: 2025-05-04 → Yes.

So respondents 15, 18, and 17 are from the target date. Now, check their 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' scores.

For each of these respondents:

- Respondent 15:
  - Recommendation (clear recommendation): 2
  - Recommendation (global rating scale): 2 → Not less than 2. So exclude.

- Respondent 18:
  - Recommendation (clear recommendation): 2
  - Recommendation (global rating scale): 2 → Exclude.

- Respondent 17:
  - Recommendation (clear recommendation): 3
  - Recommendation (global rating scale): 2 → Exclude.

Wait, none of the respondents from 2025-05-04 have a 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' of 1. Let me double-check all respondents again in case I missed any.

Looking back at all respondents:

- Respondent 6: Date 2025-04-04, clear rec 2, GRS 3.
- Respondent 14: Date 2025-03-14, clear rec 1, GRS 2. But date doesn't match.
- Respondent 15: Date 2025-05-04, clear rec 2, GRS 2.
- Respondent 18: Date 2025-05-04, clear rec 2, GRS 2.
- Respondent 20: Date 2025-05-02, clear rec 2, GRS 3.
- Respondent 17: Date 2025-05-04, clear rec 3, GRS 2.

So none of the respondents on 2025-05-04 have a 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' of 1. The only respondent with a clear rec of 1 is respondent 14, but their date is 2025-03-14. Therefore, the answer should be an empty list.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondents from sessions on '2025-03-14' have a 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' of 3 and a 'Identification' of less than 2?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find which respondents from the sessions on '2025-03-14' have a 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' of exactly 3 and an 'Identification' score of less than 2. 

First, I need to look at the data provided in the XML. Let's start by filtering the respondents based on the date. The date in question is '2025-03-14'. I'll go through each respondent's 'Date' answer to see which ones match this date.

Looking at the responses section, I see several respondents. Let's check each one:

- Respondent id=""4"": Date is 2025-05-16 – not our target.
- Respondent id=""1"": 2025-05-02 – nope.
- Respondent id=""3"": 2025-04-04 – no.
- Respondent id=""12"": 2025-05-02 – no.
- Respondent id=""18"": 2025-05-04 – no.
- Respondent id=""21"": 2025-05-16 – no.
- Respondent id=""11"": 2025-04-04 – no.
- Respondent id=""13"": Date is 2025-03-14 – this matches.
- Respondent id=""22"": 2025-05-16 – no.
- Respondent id=""5"": 2025-05-04 – no.
- Respondent id=""7"": Date is 2025-03-14 – this also matches.

So, respondents 13 and 7 are from the target date. Now, check their 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 'Identification' scores.

For respondent 13:
- 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is 2 (from the answer: <answer question=""Recommendation (global rating scale)"">2</answer>)
- 'Identification' is 3 (answer: <answer question=""Identification"">3</answer>)
So, this doesn't meet the criteria because the GRS is 2 (needs to be 3) and Identification is 3 (needs to be less than 2).

For respondent 7:
- 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is 2 (answer: <answer question=""Recommendation (global rating scale)"">2</answer>)
- 'Identification' is 3 (answer: <answer question=""Identification"">3</answer>)
Again, GRS is 2 and Identification is 3. Doesn't meet the criteria.

Wait, are there any other respondents with date 2025-03-14? Let me double-check. The data shows only respondents 13 and 7 have that date. Both have GRS of 2 and Identification of 3. The question requires GRS of 3 and Identification less than 2. Therefore, none of the respondents from 2025-03-14 meet both conditions. The answer should be an empty list.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondents from sessions on '2025-05-04' have a 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' of 2 and a 'Situation' of less than 2?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find which respondents from sessions on '2025-05-04' have a 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' of 2 and a 'Situation' score of less than 2. 

First, I need to parse the data provided. Let's look at the responses section. Each respondent has an ID and various answers to questions. The key fields here are the date, session name, 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)', and 'Situation'.

The date we're interested in is '2025-05-04'. So I'll start by filtering all respondents who have that date. Let's check each respondent:

- Respondent 9: Date is 2025-05-04.
- Respondent 15: Date is 2025-05-04.
Others have dates on 2025-05-02 or 2025-03-14, so they can be excluded.

Now, for the two respondents on 2025-05-04, check their 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and 'Situation' scores.

Looking at Respondent 9:
- 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' is 3.
- 'Situation' is 3.
So this doesn't meet the criteria because the recommendation is 3 (needs to be 2) and situation is 3 (needs to be less than 2).

Respondent 15:
- 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' is 2.
- 'Situation' is 3.
Again, the situation score is 3, which is not less than 2. So this also doesn't meet the criteria.

Wait, but maybe I missed other respondents. Let me check again. The data shows only respondents 9 and 15 have the date 2025-05-04. Both have 'Situation' scores of 3. Therefore, there are no respondents from that date with a 'Situation' less than 2 and a recommendation of 2. The answer should be an empty list.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondents from sessions on '2025-05-16' have a 'Background (history)' of 3 and a 'Background (examination)' of less than 2?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find which respondents from sessions on '2025-05-16' have a 'Background (history)' score of 3 and a 'Background (examination)' score of less than 2. 

First, I need to parse the data provided. The data is in XML format, with a list of questions and responses. The responses are under the <responses> tag, each with a respondent id. 

I'll start by filtering the respondents based on the date. The date in question is '2025-05-16'. Looking through each respondent's 'Date' answer, I need to check if their session was on that date. 

Next, for those respondents who have the correct date, I need to check their 'Background (history)' and 'Background (examination)' scores. The requirements are that 'Background (history)' is exactly 3 and 'Background (examination)' is less than 2.

Looking at the respondents:

- Respondent 5: Date is 2025-05-04. Not the target date. Skip.
- Respondent 10: Date is 2025-03-14. Skip.
- Respondent 1: 2025-05-02. Skip.
- Respondent 13: 2025-03-14. Skip.
- Respondent 11: 2025-04-04. Skip.
- Respondent 20: 2025-05-02. Skip.
- Respondent 19: Date is 2025-05-16. This matches the target date. Now check their scores. 'Background (history)' is 3, and 'Background (examination)' is 3. Wait, the examination score here is 3, which is not less than 2. So this doesn't meet the criteria.
- Respondent 15: 2025-05-04. Skip.

Wait, did I miss any other respondents with the date 2025-05-16? Let me check again. The only one is respondent 19. Their 'Background (examination)' is 3, which is not less than 2. Therefore, there are no respondents that meet both criteria. 

But wait, let me double-check. The 'Background (examination)' needs to be less than 2. So scores of 0 or 1. Respondent 19 has 3, which is above. Are there any other respondents with the date 2025-05-16? No. So the answer should be none. The final answer is an empty list.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondents have a total score across all rubric items that is higher than the average total score for all respondents?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find which respondents have a total score across all rubric items that's higher than the average total score for all respondents. 

First, I need to identify which questions are rubric items. Looking at the questions section, the rubric items are those with a scoring scale from 0 to 3. The questions with rubrics are: Identification, Situation, Background (history), Background (examination), Assessment, Recommendation (clear recommendation), and Recommendation (global rating scale). The other questions (Date, SessionName, Comments) are open-ended and don't contribute to the score.

Next, I'll go through each respondent and calculate their total score by adding up the values of their answers to these rubric questions. Let's list out each respondent and their scores:

Respondent 17:
- Identification: 3
- Situation: 3
- Background (history): 3
- Background (examination): 3
- Assessment: 3
- Recommendation (clear recommendation): 3
- Recommendation (global rating scale): 2
Total: 3+3+3+3+3+3+2 = 20

Respondent 6:
- Identification: 3
- Situation: 2
- Background (history): 3
- Background (examination): 3
- Assessment: 2
- Recommendation (clear recommendation): 2
- Recommendation (global rating scale): 3
Total: 3+2+3+3+2+2+3 = 18

Respondent 18:
- Identification: 3
- Situation: 3
- Background (history): 2
- Background (examination): 2
- Assessment: 3
- Recommendation (clear recommendation): 2
- Recommendation (global rating scale): 2
Total: 3+3+2+2+3+2+2 = 17

Respondent 22:
- Identification: 3
- Situation: 3
- Background (history): 3
- Background (examination): 3
- Assessment: 2
- Recommendation (clear recommendation): 2
- Recommendation (global rating scale): 3
Total: 3+3+3+3+2+2+3 = 19

Respondent 11:
- Identification: 3
- Situation: 3
- Background (history): 3
- Background (examination): 3
- Assessment: 3
- Recommendation (clear recommendation): 3
- Recommendation (global rating scale): 3
Total: 3+3+3+3+3+3+3 = 21

Respondent 21:
- Identification: 3
- Situation: 2
- Background (history): 3
- Background (examination): 1
- Assessment: 2
- Recommendation (clear recommendation): 3
- Recommendation (global rating scale): 3
Total: 3+2+3+1+2+3+3 = 17

Respondent 14:
- Identification: 3
- Situation: 3
- Background (history): 2
- Background (examination): 2
- Assessment: 3
- Recommendation (clear recommendation): 1
- Recommendation (global rating scale): 2
Total: 3+3+2+2+3+1+2 = 16

Respondent 15:
- Identification: 3
- Situation: 3
- Background (history): 2
- Background (examination): 3
- Assessment: 2
- Recommendation (clear recommendation): 2
- Recommendation (global rating scale): 2
Total: 3+3+2+3+2+2+2 = 17

Respondent 4:
- Identification: 3
- Situation: 3
- Background (history): 3
- Background (examination): 2
- Assessment: 2
- Recommendation (clear recommendation): 2
- Recommendation (global rating scale): 2
Total: 3+3+3+2+2+2+2 = 17

Now, let's calculate the average total score. First, sum all the totals and divide by the number of respondents (9):

20 + 18 +17 +19 +21 +17 +16 +17 +17 = 162

Average = 162 / 9 = 18

The average total score is 18. Now, we need to find respondents whose total is higher than 18. Looking at the totals:

- Respondent 17: 20 > 18 → Yes
- Respondent 6: 18 → No (equal)
- Respondent 18: 17 → No
- Respondent 22: 19 > 18 → Yes
- Respondent 11: 21 > 18 → Yes
- Others: 17 or below → No

So the respondents with total scores above the average (18) are 17, 22, and 11.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'Background (examination)' is greater than the average 'Background (examination)' for their session name.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find all respondents whose 'Background (examination)' score is greater than the average for their respective session names. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The dataset has a list of respondents, each with various answers to questions. The key fields here are 'SessionName' and 'Background (examination)'. 

The 'Background (examination)' question is a rubric with scores from 0 to 3. Each respondent's score is under their answer for that question. The SessionName varies, like ""II-Anaphylaxsis"", ""III-Sepsis"", ""IV (VT)"", etc. 

The plan is to:
1. Calculate the average 'Background (examination)' score for each session.
2. Compare each respondent's score to their session's average.
3. List the respondents whose score is above the average.

First, I'll go through each respondent and note their SessionName and Background (examination) score. Let's list them out:

- Respondent 23: SessionName ""II-Anaphylaxsis"", score 2
- Respondent 7: ""III-Sepsis"", score 3
- Respondent 22: ""IV (VT)"", score 3
- Respondent 9: ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"", score 2
- Respondent 3: ""III-Sepsis"", score 3
- Respondent 4: ""III (Sepsis)"", score 2
- Respondent 6: ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"", score 3
- Respondent 12: ""II (Anaphylaxis)"", score 3

Now, group them by SessionName. Let's see:

- II-Anaphylaxsis: 23 (score 2)
- III-Sepsis: 7 (3), 3 (3), 4 (2)
- IV (VT): 22 (3)
- II (Anaphylaxsis): 9 (2)
- II (Anaphylactic Shock): 6 (3)
- II (Anaphylaxis): 12 (3)

Wait, but some session names might be variations. For example, ""III-Sepsis"" vs ""III (Sepsis)"" – are these considered the same session? The problem states ""their session name"", so exact match. So ""III-Sepsis"" and ""III (Sepsis)"" are different. Similarly, ""II-Anaphylaxsis"", ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"", ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"", ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" – these are all different session names. So each of these is a separate group.

Now, calculate the average for each session:

1. Session ""II-Anaphylaxsis"": Only respondent 23 with score 2. Average = 2.
2. Session ""III-Sepsis"": Respondents 7 (3), 3 (3), 4 (2). Scores: 3,3,2. Sum=8, count=3. Average ≈ 2.67.
3. Session ""IV (VT)"": Respondent 22 (3). Average=3.
4. Session ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"": Respondent 9 (2). Average=2.
5. Session ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"": Respondent 6 (3). Average=3.
6. Session ""II (Anaphylaxis)"": Respondent 12 (3). Average=3.
7. Session ""III (Sepsis)"": Respondent 4 (2). Wait, no, respondent 4's SessionName is ""III (Sepsis)"", which is a different group from ""III-Sepsis"". So that's a separate group with one respondent, score 2. Average=2.

Now, for each respondent, check if their score is above the session's average.

Let's go through each:

- Respondent 23: Session ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" avg 2. Their score is 2. Not greater. Exclude.
- Respondent 7: ""III-Sepsis"" avg ~2.67. Score 3. 3 > 2.67 → include.
- Respondent 22: ""IV (VT)"" avg 3. Score 3. Not greater. Exclude.
- Respondent 9: ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"" avg 2. Score 2. Exclude.
- Respondent 3: ""III-Sepsis"" avg ~2.67. Score 3 → include.
- Respondent 4: ""III (Sepsis)"" avg 2. Score 2. Exclude.
- Respondent 6: ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"" avg 3. Score 3. Exclude.
- Respondent 12: ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" avg 3. Score 3. Exclude.

Wait, but in the ""III-Sepsis"" group, respondents 7 and 3 have scores of 3, which is above the average of 2.67. Respondent 4 is in ""III (Sepsis)"" with score 2, which equals the average (since it's the only one in that group). 

So the respondents who meet the criteria are 7 and 3. 

But wait, let me double-check the groupings. 

Wait, respondent 4's SessionName is ""III (Sepsis)"", which is a different group from ""III-Sepsis"". So in ""III (Sepsis)"", only respondent 4 is present with score 2. The average is 2, so their score is equal, not above. 

Similarly, ""III-Sepsis"" has three respondents: 7 (3), 3 (3), and 4 (2). Wait, no, wait: looking back, respondent 4's SessionName is ""III (Sepsis)"", not ""III-Sepsis"". So in the ""III-Sepsis"" group, only respondents 7 and 3? Wait no, original data:

Looking back:

Respondent 7: SessionName ""III-Sepsis""

Respondent 3: SessionName ""III-Sepsis""

Wait, no. Wait, let's check each respondent's SessionName again:

- Respondent 7: SessionName ""III-Sepsis""

- Respondent 3: SessionName ""III-Sepsis""

- Respondent 4: SessionName ""III (Sepsis)""

So ""III-Sepsis"" has respondents 7 and 3, and 4 is in a different session ""III (Sepsis)"".

Wait, no. Let me check again:

Looking at the data:

Respondent 7:

<answer question=""SessionName"">III-Sepsis</answer>

Respondent 3:

<answer question=""SessionName"">III-Sepsis</answer>

Respondent 4:

<answer question=""SessionName"">III (Sepsis)</answer>

So ""III-Sepsis"" and ""III (Sepsis)"" are different session names. Therefore, ""III-Sepsis"" has respondents 7 and 3. Wait, no, wait:

Wait, in the data provided, the respondents are:

Looking at the XML data:

<respondent id=""7"">
  <answer question=""SessionName"">III-Sepsis</answer>
...
</respondent>

<respondent id=""3"">
  <answer question=""SessionName"">III-Sepsis</answer>
...
</respondent>

<respondent id=""4"">
  <answer question=""SessionName"">III (Sepsis)</answer>
...
</respondent>

So ""III-Sepsis"" has respondents 7 and 3. Wait, no, respondent 3's SessionName is ""III-Sepsis"", and respondent 4's is ""III (Sepsis)"". So ""III-Sepsis"" group has two respondents: 7 and 3. Wait, no, looking again:

Wait, in the data, the respondents are:

- Respondent 7: SessionName ""III-Sepsis""

- Respondent 3: SessionName ""III-Sepsis""

- Respondent 4: SessionName ""III (Sepsis)""

So ""III-Sepsis"" has two respondents: 7 and 3. Then, the average for ""III-Sepsis"" would be (3 + 3) / 2 = 3. So each of their scores is 3, which is equal to the average. Therefore, they are not above the average. Wait, but earlier I thought there were three respondents in ""III-Sepsis"", but that's incorrect. Let me correct that.

Wait, in the data, the respondents with SessionName ""III-Sepsis"" are:

- Respondent 7: score 3

- Respondent 3: score 3

Wait, no, looking at the data again:

Wait, respondent 3's data:

<respondent id=""3"">
  <answer question=""SessionName"">III-Sepsis</answer>
  <answer question=""Background (examination)"">3</answer>
</respondent>

Respondent 7:

<respondent id=""7"">
  <answer question=""SessionName"">III-Sepsis</answer>
  <answer question=""Background (examination)"">3</answer>
</respondent>

So ""III-Sepsis"" has two respondents: 7 and 3, both with score 3. The average is (3 + 3)/2 = 3. So their scores are equal to the average, not above. Therefore, they don't qualify.

Wait, but earlier I thought there was a third respondent in that group, but that's a mistake. So the ""III-Sepsis"" group has two respondents, both with 3. So average is 3. So their scores are not greater than the average. Therefore, no one in that group qualifies.

Then, looking at other sessions:

- ""IV (VT)"": respondent 22, score 3, average 3 → no.

- ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"": respondent 6, score 3, average 3 → no.

- ""II (Anaphylaxis)"": respondent 12, score 3, average 3 → no.

- ""III (Sepsis)"": respondent 4, score 2, average 2 → no.

- ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"": respondent 9, score 2, average 2 → no.

- ""II-Anaphylaxsis"": respondent 23, score 2, average 2 → no.

Wait, but then there are no respondents whose score is above the average for their session. But that can't be right. Did I make a mistake in grouping?

Wait, let's recheck all session names and their respondents:

Looking at all respondents:

1. Respondent 23: SessionName ""II-Anaphylaxsis""

2. Respondent 7: ""III-Sepsis""

3. Respondent 22: ""IV (VT)""

4. Respondent 9: ""II (Anaphylaxsis)""

5. Respondent 3: ""III-Sepsis""

6. Respondent 4: ""III (Sepsis)""

7. Respondent 6: ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)""

8. Respondent 12: ""II (Anaphylaxis)""

So grouping by exact SessionName:

- ""II-Anaphylaxsis"": [23] → avg 2

- ""III-Sepsis"": [7,3] → scores 3,3 → avg 3

- ""IV (VT)"": [22] → avg 3

- ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"": [9] → avg 2

- ""III (Sepsis)"": [4] → avg 2

- ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"": [6] → avg 3

- ""II (Anaphylaxis)"": [12] → avg 3

So in each group, the average is equal to the scores of the respondents. Therefore, no one has a score greater than the average. But that can't be the case. Wait, perhaps I missed a respondent in a group where the average is lower than their score.

Wait, let's check again. For example, if a session has multiple respondents with varying scores.

Wait, looking at the data again, perhaps I made a mistake in grouping. Let me list all respondents with their SessionName and Background (examination) score:

1. 23: II-Anaphylaxsis, 2

2. 7: III-Sepsis, 3

3. 22: IV (VT), 3

4. 9: II (Anaphylaxsis), 2

5. 3: III-Sepsis, 3

6. 4: III (Sepsis), 2

7. 6: II (Anaphylactic Shock), 3

8. 12: II (Anaphylaxis), 3

So the only session with more than one respondent is ""III-Sepsis"" (respondents 7 and 3, both with 3). Their average is 3. So their scores are equal, not above. All other sessions have one respondent each, so their average is their own score, so no one is above. Therefore, there are no respondents where their Background (examination) score is greater than the average for their session. 

But that seems odd. The answer would be an empty list. But maybe I missed a session where there are multiple respondents with varying scores. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps ""III (Sepsis)"" has more respondents? No, only respondent 4. ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"" only respondent 9. All others are single-respondent sessions. So indeed, no one has a score above the average. 

But the example given in the problem had an empty answer, but that was for a different query. So in this case, the answer would be an empty list. But let me check again to make sure.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation for ""III-Sepsis"". If the session has two respondents with scores 3 and 3, average is 3. So their scores are equal. So no one is above. 

Another check: any session where a respondent's score is higher than the average. For example, if a session has two respondents with scores 2 and 3, the average is 2.5. Then the respondent with 3 would be above. But in the given data, there's no such case. All sessions with multiple respondents have the same scores. 

Therefore, the correct answer is that there are no respondents meeting the criteria. So the answer is an empty list.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents whose 'Background (history)' is within 1 point of the lowest 'Identification' for their session name.
