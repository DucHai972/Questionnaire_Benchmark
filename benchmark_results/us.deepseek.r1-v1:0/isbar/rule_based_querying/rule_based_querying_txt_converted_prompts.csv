</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
List all respondents from the '(MI)-VT' session whose 'Identification' is exactly 0.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to list all respondents from the '(MI)-VT' session whose 'Identification' score is exactly 0. 

First, I need to go through each respondent in the provided data and check two things: whether their SessionName is '(MI)-VT' and if their Identification score is 0. 

Looking at the responses:

Starting with Respondent 16. Their SessionName is 'I - MI', which doesn't match '(MI)-VT'. So, skip.

Respondent 7 has SessionName 'III-Sepsis'—nope.

Respondent 11's SessionName is 'IV (AF)'—not matching.

Respondent 10's SessionName is '(MI)-VT'. That's a match. Now check their Identification score. It's 2. So, doesn't meet the 0 requirement. So, not included.

Respondent 1: SessionName is 'V (Hypoglycemia)'—no.

Respondent 22: 'IV (VT)'—close but not exactly '(MI)-VT'.

Respondent 18: 'IV - VT'—again, not the exact session name.

Respondent 4: 'III (Sepsis)'—nope.

Now, checking all respondents, none of them in the '(MI)-VT' session have an Identification score of 0. The only one in that session is Respondent 10, but their score is 2. So, the answer should be an empty list.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
List all respondents from the 'MI' session whose 'Assessment' is exactly 2.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The user wants a list of respondents from the 'MI' session with an 'Assessment' score exactly equal to 2. 

First, I need to go through each respondent in the provided data and check two things: their SessionName and their Assessment score. 

Looking at the SessionName for each respondent:
- Respondent 7: III-Sepsis
- Respondent 12: II (Anaphylaxis)
- Respondent 11: IV (AF)
- Respondent 14: IV-Hypoglycemia
- Respondent 2: MI
- Respondent 8: III (Sepsis)
- Respondent 5: II - Anaphylaxsis
- Respondent 1: V (Hypoglycemia)
- Respondent 17: V (Hypoglycemia)
- Respondent 9: II (Anaphylaxsis)

So, only Respondent 2 has the SessionName 'MI'. Now, check their Assessment score. Respondent 2's Assessment is 3. The task requires the Assessment to be exactly 2. 

Wait, but the user is asking for 'MI' session and Assessment 2. Since the only MI session respondent (Respondent 2) has an Assessment of 3, there are no respondents that meet both criteria. 

Therefore, the answer should be an empty list.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents from the 'II (Anaphylaxis)' session whose 'Identification' is exactly 0.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to list all respondents from the 'II (Anaphylaxis)' session whose 'Identification' is exactly 0. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The questions section defines each field. The 'SessionName' is an open-ended question, so the responses can vary, but I need to match exactly 'II (Anaphylaxis)'. The 'Identification' field uses a rubric where 0 means ""Requires direct prompting"".

Now, looking at the responses, I'll go through each respondent one by one.

Starting with Respondent 9: Their SessionName is ""II (Anaphylaxsis)""—wait, that's spelled with an extra 's' (Anaphylaxsis vs Anaphylaxis). That's a typo, but the task specifies 'II (Anaphylaxis)', so this might not match. Their Identification is 3, so they don't qualify.

Respondent 16: SessionName is ""I - MI"". Not relevant.

Respondent 21: ""I (Myocardial infarction)"". Not the session we're looking for.

Respondent 22: ""IV (VT)"". Nope.

Respondent 15: ""III - Sepsis"". Not matching.

Respondent 6: SessionName is ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"". Close, but the name is slightly different. The task specifies 'Anaphylaxis', so this might be a different session. Identification is 3 here.

Respondent 12: SessionName is ""II (Anaphylaxis)"". This matches exactly. Their Identification is 3, so they don't meet the 0 requirement.

Respondent 18: ""IV - VT"". Not relevant.

Respondent 3: SessionName is ""III-Sepsis"". Not matching. Their Identification is 0, but the session is different.

Respondent 17: ""V (Hypoglycemia)"". No.

So, the key points are:

- Check for SessionName exactly 'II (Anaphylaxis)'. Only Respondent 12 has that exact name. However, their Identification is 3, so they don't qualify.

Wait, but the task is to find those in 'II (Anaphylaxis)' with Identification 0. Looking again, Respondent 12's SessionName is correct, but Identification is 3. Are there any others?

Wait, Respondent 6's SessionName is ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"", which is a different session name. Even though it's similar, it's not exactly 'II (Anaphylaxis)'.

No other respondents have the exact SessionName 'II (Anaphylaxis)' except Respondent 12. But their Identification is 3. So there are no respondents in that session with Identification 0.

Therefore, the answer should be an empty list.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
List all respondents from the 'III-Sepsis' session whose 'Background (examination)' is exactly 2.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The goal is to list all respondents from the 'III-Sepsis' session who have a 'Background (examination)' score of exactly 2. 

First, I need to go through each respondent in the provided data and check two things: their SessionName and their Background (examination) score. 

Starting with Respondent 3: Their SessionName is 'III-Sepsis', and the Background (examination) is 3. That's higher than 2, so they don't qualify.

Next, Respondent 5's SessionName is 'II - Anaphylaxsis', which doesn't match 'III-Sepsis', so skip.

Respondent 1 is in 'V (Hypoglycemia)', so no match here either.

Respondent 7 has SessionName 'III-Sepsis'. Now, check their Background (examination) score. It's 3 again, so still not 2. 

Respondent 17 is in 'V (Hypoglycemia)', so moving on.

Respondent 15's SessionName is 'III - Sepsis'. Wait, the task specifies 'III-Sepsis' exactly. The hyphen and spacing might matter here. The data shows 'III-Sepsis' for Respondent 3 and 7, but Respondent 15 has 'III - Sepsis' with spaces around the hyphen. Depending on how strict the matching is, this could be a different session. But maybe it's a typo or formatting difference. However, the task says 'III-Sepsis', so unless specified otherwise, I should consider exact matches. So Respondent 15's session doesn't match exactly, so they're out.

Respondent 12 is in 'II (Anaphylaxis)', so no.

Respondent 2's SessionName is 'MI', which doesn't match.

Wait, are there any other respondents? Let me check again. The responses listed are 3,5,1,7,17,15,12,2. So that's all. 

Looking again, none of the respondents in 'III-Sepsis' (Respondents 3 and 7) have a Background (examination) of 2. Both have 3. The only other possible is Respondent 15, but their SessionName is 'III - Sepsis', which might be a different session name. So according to the exact data provided, there are no respondents in 'III-Sepsis' with Background (examination) exactly 2. 

Therefore, the answer should be an empty list.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'Assessment' score is between 0 and 1.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task. The user wants me to find all respondents whose 'Assessment' score is between 0 and 1. First, I need to make sure I understand the data structure provided.

Looking at the questions section, the 'Assessment' question is number 7. The rubric for Assessment is: 0 = No logical assessment, 1 = Assessment only after extended questioning, 2 = Assessment after minimal questioning, 3 = Comprehensive logical assessment without questioning. So the possible scores are 0, 1, 2, or 3. The task is to find respondents where the Assessment score is between 0 and 1. That would include scores 0 and 1, right? Because ""between"" in this context likely means inclusive. So any respondent with an Assessment of 0 or 1 should be listed.

Now, I need to go through each respondent in the responses and check their Assessment score. Let's start going through them one by one.

Respondent 22: Assessment is 2. So no.

Respondent 16: Assessment is 3. No.

Respondent 1: Assessment is 3. No.

Respondent 21: Assessment is 2. No.

Respondent 18: Assessment is 3. No.

Respondent 19: Assessment is 2. No.

Respondent 14: Assessment is 3. No.

Respondent 20: Assessment is 3. No.

Respondent 23: Assessment is 3. No.

Respondent 9: Assessment is 2. No.

Respondent 12: Assessment is 2. No.

Respondent 5: Assessment is 3. No.

Wait, none of the respondents have an Assessment score of 0 or 1. Let me double-check each one again to make sure I didn't miss any.

Looking again:

All respondents have Assessment scores of 2 or 3. For example, Respondent 1 has 3, Respondent 9 has 2, etc. There's no one with 0 or 1. So the answer should be that there are no respondents meeting the criteria. Therefore, the list is empty.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'Assessment' score is between 0 and 1.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task. The user wants me to find all respondents whose 'Assessment' score is between 0 and 1. First, I need to make sure I understand the 'Assessment' field correctly.

Looking at the questions section, the 'Assessment' question is number 7. The rubric says: 0 = No logical assessment, 1 = Assessment only after extended questioning, 2 = Assessment after minimal questioning, 3 = Comprehensive logical assessment without questioning. So the possible scores are 0, 1, 2, or 3. The task is to find respondents where the Assessment is between 0 and 1. That would include scores of 0 and 1, right? Because between 0 and 1, inclusive, would be those two values. But wait, the way it's phrased is ""between 0 and 1""—sometimes people might interpret that as greater than 0 and less than 1, but since these are integers, the only possible values are 0 and 1. So I need to check each respondent's Assessment score and see if it's either 0 or 1.

Now, let's go through each respondent in the responses section one by one.

Starting with Respondent 20: Assessment is 3. That's above 1, so no.

Respondent 17: Assessment is 3. Also no.

Respondent 9: Assessment is 2. Still no.

Respondent 12: Assessment is 2. No.

Respondent 21: Assessment is 2. No.

Respondent 13: Assessment is 2. No.

Respondent 3: Assessment is 3. No.

Respondent 23: Assessment is 3. No.

Wait a minute, none of the respondents have an Assessment score of 0 or 1. Let me double-check each one again to make sure I didn't miss any.

Looking again:

Respondent 20: 3

17:3

9:2

12:2

21:2

13:2

3:3

23:3

Hmm, all of them have Assessment scores of 2 or 3. So there are no respondents with a score of 0 or 1. Therefore, the answer should be an empty list. But let me check if there's any other respondent I might have missed. The list includes respondents 20,17,9,12,21,13,3,23. Are there any others? The data shows up to Respondent 23, but maybe there are more? Wait, looking at the data provided, the responses section lists these 8 respondents. So no others. Therefore, the answer is that there are no respondents with an Assessment score between 0 and 1. So the final answer should be an empty list.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents from the 'MI' session whose 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is exactly 0.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to list all respondents from the 'MI' session who have a 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' score of exactly 0. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The questions section defines each field. The 'SessionName' is an open-ended question, so it's a text field. The 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' uses a rubric where 0 means ""Not at all confident"".

Now, looking at the responses, I need to check each respondent's 'SessionName' and their 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' score. 

Let's go through each respondent one by one:

- **Respondent 15**: SessionName is ""III - Sepsis"". Not MI. GRS is 2. Doesn't qualify.
- **Respondent 19**: SessionName is ""I - MI"". This is MI. GRS is 3. Not 0.
- **Respondent 8**: SessionName is ""III (Sepsis)"". Not MI. GRS 3. No.
- **Respondent 21**: SessionName is ""I (Myocardial infarction)"". MI is part of the name. GRS 3. Not 0.
- **Respondent 10**: SessionName is ""(MI)-VT"". This includes MI. GRS is 2. Doesn't meet.
- **Respondent 3**: SessionName ""III-Sepsis"". Not MI. GRS 3. No.
- **Respondent 2**: SessionName ""MI"". Exactly MI. GRS is 1. Not 0.
- **Respondent 18**: SessionName ""IV - VT"". Not MI. GRS 2. No.
- **Respondent 7**: SessionName ""III-Sepsis"". Not MI. GRS 2. No.
- **Respondent 23**: SessionName ""II-Anaphylaxsis"". Not MI. GRS 3. No.
- **Respondent 14**: SessionName ""IV-Hypoglycemia"". Not MI. GRS 2. No.

After checking all, none of the respondents in the 'MI' session have a GRS of 0. The closest is Respondent 2 with GRS 1, and Respondent 10 in (MI)-VT with GRS 2. But the task specifically asks for 'MI' session. Wait, the task says 'MI' session, but in the data, there's a SessionName ""I - MI"" (Respondent 19), ""I (Myocardial infarction)"" (Respondent 21), and ""(MI)-VT"" (Respondent 10). The exact session name might matter. The task says 'MI' session, so maybe only those where SessionName is exactly 'MI'? Let me check the data again.

Looking at the SessionName for each:

- Respondent 2: SessionName is ""MI"" exactly. GRS 1.
- Respondent 19: ""I - MI"" includes MI but isn't exactly 'MI'.
- Respondent 21: ""I (Myocardial infarction)"" is MI but the name is written differently.
- Respondent 10: ""(MI)-VT"" includes MI but is part of a longer name.

The task says ""from the 'MI' session"", which might refer to the exact SessionName being 'MI'. So only Respondent 2. But their GRS is 1, not 0. Therefore, there are no respondents in the exact 'MI' session with GRS 0. 

Alternatively, if the task considers any session that includes 'MI' in the name (like ""I - MI"" or ""(MI)-VT""), then we check those. But the original example in the user's message had the task asking for '(MI)-VT' session, which was handled as a specific session name. So the current task is for 'MI' session, exact match. Therefore, only Respondent 2, but their GRS is 1. Hence, no respondents meet the criteria. The answer is an empty list.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents from the 'V (Hypoglycemia)' session whose 'Background (examination)' is exactly 1.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The user wants a list of respondents from the 'V (Hypoglycemia)' session where their 'Background (examination)' score is exactly 1. 

First, I need to go through each respondent in the provided data and check two things: their SessionName and their Background (examination) score. 

Starting with Respondent 2: SessionName is 'MI', which doesn't match. So skip.

Respondent 3: SessionName is 'III-Sepsis' – not the one we're looking for.

Respondent 9: SessionName is 'II (Anaphylaxsis)', nope.

Respondent 18: 'IV - VT' – not matching.

Respondent 19: 'I - MI' – no.

Respondent 23: 'II-Anaphylaxsis' – not it.

Respondent 6: 'II (Anaphylactic Shock)' – nope.

Respondent 11: 'IV (AF)' – not the right session.

Now, Respondent 1: SessionName is 'V (Hypoglycemia)'. That's a match. Now check their Background (examination) score. The value here is 2. The task requires exactly 1, so this doesn't qualify.

Wait, are there any other respondents with SessionName 'V (Hypoglycemia)'? Let me check again. The data shows only Respondent 1 has that SessionName. Their Background (examination) is 2, so no one meets both criteria. 

Therefore, there are no respondents in the 'V (Hypoglycemia)' session with a Background (examination) score of exactly 1. The answer should be an empty list.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").

<task>
List all respondents from the 'I (Myocardial infarction)' session whose 'Background (examination)' is exactly 3.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The question is asking to list all respondents from the 'I (Myocardial infarction)' session who have a 'Background (examination)' score of exactly 3. 

First, I need to understand the data structure provided. The data includes multiple respondents, each with various fields. The key fields here are 'SessionName' and 'Background (examination)'. 

Looking at the 'SessionName' for each respondent:
- Respondent 21: SessionName is ""I (Myocardial infarction)""
- Respondent 9: SessionName is ""II (Anaphylaxsis)""
- Respondent 15: SessionName is ""III - Sepsis""
- Respondent 16: SessionName is ""I - MI""
- Respondent 8: SessionName is ""III (Sepsis)""

Now, the task specifies the session as 'I (Myocardial infarction)'. I need to check which respondents are in this session. Respondent 21 is clearly in that session. Respondent 16's SessionName is ""I - MI"", which might be an abbreviation for Myocardial Infarction. However, the exact session name in the task is 'I (Myocardial infarction)', so I need to see if ""I - MI"" is considered the same. Since the task specifies the exact session name, I should check if ""I - MI"" is equivalent. But in data analysis, exact string matching is usually required unless specified otherwise. The original example in the data shows ""I (Myocardial infarction)"" for Respondent 21 and ""I - MI"" for Respondent 16. The task uses the former, so ""I - MI"" might be a different session name. However, ""MI"" stands for Myocardial Infarction, so maybe they are the same. But the problem says to use the exact SessionName as given. The example in the data has both ""I (Myocardial infarction)"" and ""I - MI"", so they are considered different sessions. Therefore, only Respondent 21 is in the 'I (Myocardial infarction)' session.

Next, check the 'Background (examination)' score for these respondents. For Respondent 21, the score is 1. For Respondent 16, even though their SessionName is ""I - MI"", their Background (examination) is 3. But since the session name doesn't exactly match 'I (Myocardial infarction)', Respondent 16 is excluded. 

Therefore, the only respondent in the specified session is Respondent 21, but their Background (examination) score is 1, not 3. So there are no respondents that meet both criteria. The answer should be an empty list.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents from the 'II - Anaphylaxsis' session whose 'Background (examination)' is exactly 1.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The user wants a list of respondents from the 'II - Anaphylaxsis' session who have a 'Background (examination)' score of exactly 1. 

First, I need to look through each respondent in the provided data. Let's start by checking each respondent's SessionName and Background (examination) score.

Looking at Respondent 3: Their SessionName is III-Sepsis, which doesn't match. Background (examination) is 3. So, no.

Respondent 9: SessionName is II (Anaphylaxsis). Hmm, the task specifies 'II - Anaphylaxsis' with a hyphen and space. But the data here has parentheses. Wait, the user's task might have a typo, but I should check if these are considered the same. The actual data has ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"" for Respondent 9 and ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" for Respondent 5. The task is looking for 'II - Anaphylaxsis', which matches Respondent 5's SessionName. But Respondent 9's SessionName is written with parentheses. However, maybe the user intended both variations. Wait, the task says exactly 'II - Anaphylaxsis', so I should check the exact match. Let me check the data again.

Respondent 5's SessionName is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"". So that's a direct match. Respondent 9's is ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"" which is different. So only Respondent 5's session matches exactly. Now, check their Background (examination) score. Respondent 5's Background (examination) is 3, which is not 1. So they don't qualify.

Wait, but maybe the user made a typo and the session names are variations. Let me check all respondents. 

Looking at Respondent 5: SessionName is II - Anaphylaxsis, Background (examination) is 3. 

Respondent 9: SessionName II (Anaphylaxsis), Background (examination) is 2. 

Respondent 13: I-VF. 

Respondent 21: I (Myocardial infarction). 

Respondent 20: IV (VT). 

So, the only respondent with SessionName exactly 'II - Anaphylaxsis' is Respondent 5. But their Background (examination) is 3, not 1. 

Wait, the task is to find those in 'II - Anaphylaxsis' with Background (examination) exactly 1. But in the data provided, no one in that exact session has a Background (examination) of 1. 

Wait, maybe I missed someone. Let me check again. 

Looking at all respondents:

- Respondent 3: III-Sepsis
- Respondent 9: II (Anaphylaxsis) - Background (examination) 2
- Respondent 5: II - Anaphylaxsis - Background (examination) 3
- Respondent 13: I-VF
- Respondent 21: I (Myocardial infarction)
- Respondent 20: IV (VT)

No one in the 'II - Anaphylaxsis' session has a Background (examination) of 1. Therefore, the answer should be an empty list. 

But wait, maybe the user intended to include variations in the SessionName, like different punctuation. For example, ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"" vs. ""II - Anaphylaxsis"". If that's the case, then Respondent 9 is in a similar session but with parentheses. However, the task specifies 'II - Anaphylaxsis' exactly. So unless there's a typo in the task, we have to stick to exact matches. 

Therefore, the correct answer is that there are no respondents meeting both criteria. The list is empty.

<task>
List all respondents from the 'MI' session whose 'Background (history)' is exactly 0.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The user wants a list of all respondents from the 'MI' session who have a 'Background (history)' score of exactly 0. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The dataset has a list of respondents, each with various fields. The key fields here are 'SessionName' and 'Background (history)'. 

Looking at the 'Questions' section, the 'Background (history)' is question 5, which uses a rubric. The possible scores are 0 to 3, with 0 meaning ""History is unstructured or non-relevant"". The task is to find respondents where this score is exactly 0.

Next, the 'SessionName' needs to be 'MI'. I should check each respondent's 'SessionName' to see if it matches exactly 'MI' (case-sensitive, as per the output rules). However, I should also be cautious about possible variations. For example, in the example given, there's a session named '(MI)-VT' and another 'MI'. The task specifically asks for 'MI', so I need exact matches.

Now, I'll go through each respondent in the 'Responses' section:

- **Respondent 12**: SessionName is 'II (Anaphylaxis)', so not MI. Background (history) is 3. Skip.
- **Respondent 4**: SessionName 'III (Sepsis)'. Background (history) 3. Not relevant.
- **Respondent 3**: SessionName 'III-Sepsis'. Background (history) 3. Skip.
- **Respondent 1**: SessionName 'V (Hypoglycemia)'. Background (history) 2. No.
- **Respondent 10**: SessionName '(MI)-VT'. This includes 'MI' but the full name is '(MI)-VT', so it's a different session. So not 'MI' exactly. Background (history) is 2. Doesn't qualify.
- **Respondent 15**: SessionName 'III - Sepsis'. Background (history) 2. Not MI.
- **Respondent 23**: SessionName 'II-Anaphylaxsis'. Background (history) 2. No.
- **Respondent 9**: SessionName 'II (Anaphylaxsis)'. Background (history) 2. Not MI.
- **Respondent 2**: SessionName 'MI'. Here's a match. Now check 'Background (history)': it's 2. The task requires exactly 0, so this doesn't qualify.
- **Respondent 21**: SessionName 'I (Myocardial infarction)'. Not MI. Background (history) 3. No.

After checking all respondents, none have both SessionName exactly 'MI' and a 'Background (history)' score of 0. The only respondent with SessionName 'MI' is Respondent 2, but their Background (history) is 2, not 0. Therefore, there are no respondents that meet both criteria.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondents from sessions on '2025-05-04' have a 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' of 1 and a 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' of less than 2?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The task is to find which respondents from sessions on '2025-05-04' have a 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' of 1 and a 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' of less than 2.

First, I need to look at the data provided. Let's go through each respondent one by one, checking the date first. The date in question is May 4, 2025, which is written as 2025-05-04 in the data.

Looking at the respondents:

- Respondent 6: Date is 2025-04-04. Not the right date. Skip.
- Respondent 14: 2025-03-14. Also not. Skip.
- Respondent 15: 2025-05-04. This date matches. Now check their 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and 'Recommendation (global rating scale)'. Clear recommendation is 2, GRS is 2. But we need clear recommendation of 1 and GRS less than 2. So this doesn't fit.
- Respondent 18: Date is 2025-05-04. Clear recommendation is 2, GRS is 2. Again, doesn't meet the criteria.
- Respondent 20: Date is 2025-05-02. Not the 4th. Skip.
- Respondent 17: Date is 2025-05-04. Clear recommendation is 3, GRS is 2. So GRS is 2, which is not less than 2. So no.

Wait, are there any other respondents? Let me check again. The list includes Respondents 6,14,15,18,20,17. That's all. 

Looking again, none of the respondents on 2025-05-04 have a 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' of 1. The possible scores for that are 0,1,2,3. The respondents on that date (15,18,17) have 2,2,3 respectively. So none meet the clear recommendation of 1. Also, even if there was a 1, the GRS needs to be less than 2, which would be 0 or 1. But in the data, none of the May 4th respondents have GRS less than 2. 

So the answer should be that there are no respondents meeting these criteria. The final answer is an empty list.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondents from sessions on '2025-03-14' have a 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' of 3 and a 'Identification' of less than 2?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The question is asking which respondents from the sessions on '2025-03-14' have a 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' of 3 and an 'Identification' score of less than 2. 

First, I need to look through all the respondents and filter them based on the date. The date given is March 14, 2025. Let me check each respondent's date.

Looking at the responses:

- Respondent 13 has the date 2025-03-14.
- Respondent 7 also has the date 2025-03-14.

No other respondents have that date. So those are the two to consider.

Next, check their 'Recommendation (global rating scale)'. The requirement is that this should be exactly 3. 

For Respondent 13: The 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is 2. So that doesn't meet the criteria. 

For Respondent 7: The 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is also 2. So neither of them have a score of 3 here. 

Additionally, the 'Identification' score needs to be less than 2. Let's check that. 

Respondent 13's Identification is 3, which is not less than 2. 

Respondent 7's Identification is 3 as well. So neither meets the Identification criteria. 

Wait, but are there any other respondents with the date 2025-03-14? Let me double-check. The other respondents have dates in April and May 2025. So only Respondents 13 and 7 are from March 14. 

Since both of them have a 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' of 2 and Identification of 3, which is not less than 2, there are no respondents that meet both criteria. 

Therefore, the answer should be that there are no such respondents.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondents from sessions on '2025-05-04' have a 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' of 2 and a 'Situation' of less than 2?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The question is asking which respondents from sessions on '2025-05-04' have a 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' of 2 and a 'Situation' score of less than 2. 

First, I need to parse through the data provided. Let's start by looking at the responses from the given date, which is May 4, 2025. 

Looking at the responses, I see that Respondent 9 and Respondent 15 have the date 2025-05-04. The other respondents (12, 8, 16, 7) have different dates, so they can be excluded from consideration.

Now, for each of these two respondents (9 and 15), I need to check two things: their 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' score and their 'Situation' score. 

Starting with Respondent 9:
- 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' is 3. The question requires this to be exactly 2, so this doesn't meet the criteria.
- 'Situation' is 3, which is not less than 2. So Respondent 9 is out.

Next, Respondent 15:
- 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' is 2. That matches the required value.
- 'Situation' is 3, which again is not less than 2. So Respondent 15 also doesn't meet the criteria.

Wait, but both respondents on May 4th have a 'Situation' score of 3. The task requires the 'Situation' to be less than 2. Since neither of them have a 'Situation' score below 2, there are no respondents that meet both conditions. 

Therefore, the answer should be that there are no such respondents. Let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss any other respondents with the correct date. The other respondents on 2025-05-04 are indeed only 9 and 15. Both have 'Situation' scores of 3, which is above 2. So no one fits the criteria.

</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The question is asking which respondents from sessions on '2025-05-16' have a 'Background (history)' of 3 and a 'Background (examination)' of less than 2. 

First, I need to look through all the respondents and filter them based on the date. The date given is 2025-05-16. Let me check each respondent's date.

Looking at the responses:

- Respondent 5: 2025-05-04 – not the target date.
- Respondent 10: 2025-03-14 – nope.
- Respondent 1: 2025-05-02 – no.
- Respondent 13: 2025-03-14 – no.
- Respondent 11: 2025-04-04 – no.
- Respondent 20: 2025-05-02 – no.
- Respondent 19: 2025-05-16 – this matches the date.
- Respondent 15: 2025-05-04 – not the date.

So only Respondent 19 is from 2025-05-16. Now, check their 'Background (history)' and 'Background (examination)' scores. 

For Respondent 19:
- Background (history): 3
- Background (examination): 3

Wait, the task requires 'Background (history)' to be exactly 3 and 'Background (examination)' to be less than 2. But here, the examination is 3, which is not less than 2. So Respondent 19 doesn't meet the criteria. 

Are there any other respondents with the date 2025-05-16? From the list, no. So even though Respondent 19 is on the correct date, their examination score is too high. Therefore, there are no respondents that meet both conditions. The answer should be an empty list.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondents have a total score across all rubric items that is higher than the average total score for all respondents?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find which respondents have a total score across all rubric items that's higher than the average total score for all respondents. 

First, I need to identify which questions are rubric items. Looking at the questions section, the rubric items are questions 3 through 9. Each of these has a rubric with scores from 0 to 3. The other questions (Date, SessionName, Comments) are open-ended and don't contribute to the score. So, for each respondent, I need to sum their scores from Identification (Q3) to Recommendation (global rating scale) (Q9). 

Next, I'll go through each respondent and calculate their total scores. Let's list them out:

Respondent 17:
3 (Identification) + 3 (Situation) + 3 (History) + 3 (Examination) + 3 (Assessment) + 3 (Clear Rec) + 2 (GRS) = 3+3+3+3+3+3+2 = 20

Respondent 6:
3 + 2 +3 +3 +2 +2 +3 = 3+2=5, +3=8, +3=11, +2=13, +2=15, +3=18. Total 18.

Respondent 18:
3 +3 +2 +2 +3 +2 +2 = 3+3=6, +2=8, +2=10, +3=13, +2=15, +2=17. Total 17.

Respondent 22:
3 +3 +3 +3 +2 +2 +3 = 3+3=6, +3=9, +3=12, +2=14, +2=16, +3=19. Total 19.

Respondent 11:
3 +3 +3 +3 +3 +3 +3 = 3*7=21. Total 21.

Respondent 21:
3 +2 +3 +1 +2 +3 +3 = 3+2=5, +3=8, +1=9, +2=11, +3=14, +3=17. Total 17.

Respondent 14:
3 +3 +2 +2 +3 +1 +2 = 3+3=6, +2=8, +2=10, +3=13, +1=14, +2=16. Total 16.

Respondent 15:
3 +3 +2 +3 +2 +2 +2 = 3+3=6, +2=8, +3=11, +2=13, +2=15, +2=17. Total 17.

Respondent 4:
3 +3 +3 +2 +2 +2 +2 = 3+3=6, +3=9, +2=11, +2=13, +2=15, +2=17. Total 17.

Now, let's list all the totals:
- 17: 20
- 6: 18
- 18:17
- 22:19
- 11:21
- 21:17
-14:16
-15:17
-4:17

Now, calculate the average total score. Sum all these totals and divide by the number of respondents (9).

Sum = 20 +18 +17 +19 +21 +17 +16 +17 +17 = Let's add step by step:

20+18=38; 38+17=55; 55+19=74; 74+21=95; 95+17=112; 112+16=128; 128+17=145; 145+17=162. Total sum is 162. Average is 162 /9 = 18.

So the average total score is 18. Now, we need to find which respondents have a total higher than 18. Looking at the totals:

Respondent 17: 20 >18 → yes
Respondent 6: 18 → no (equal)
Respondent 18:17 → no
Respondent 22:19 → yes
Respondent 11:21 → yes
Others are 17 or 16, which are below 18.

So the respondents with total scores above average (18) are 17, 22, and 11. Their totals are 20,19,21 respectively. 

Therefore, the answer should be these three respondents: 17, 22, 11.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'Background (examination)' is greater than the average 'Background (examination)' for their session name.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find all respondents whose 'Background (examination)' score is greater than the average for their respective session names. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The data has multiple respondents, each with a SessionName and a Background (examination) score. The goal is to compare each respondent's score against the average of their session.

So, the first thing I need to do is group the respondents by their SessionName. Then, calculate the average Background (examination) score for each group. After that, compare each individual's score in the group to see if it's above the group's average.

Looking at the data provided, let's list out all the SessionNames and their corresponding Background (examination) scores:

- II-Anaphylaxsis: Respondent 23 has a score of 2.
- III-Sepsis: Respondent 7 has 3, Respondent 3 has 3, Respondent 4 has 2.
- IV (VT): Respondent 22 has 3.
- II (Anaphylaxsis): Respondent 9 has 2.
- II (Anaphylactic Shock): Respondent 6 has 3.
- II (Anaphylaxis): Respondent 12 has 3.

Wait, I need to check if the SessionNames are considered the same if they have different formatting. For example, ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" vs. ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"" vs. ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"" vs. ""II (Anaphylaxis)"". Are these considered different sessions? The SessionName is an open-ended field, so variations in naming would mean different sessions. So each of these would be separate groups. Similarly, ""III-Sepsis"" and ""III (Sepsis)"" might be considered the same, but the data shows ""III-Sepsis"" and ""III (Sepsis)"" as different entries. Let me check the respondents:

Respondent 7: SessionName III-Sepsis
Respondent 3: SessionName III-Sepsis
Respondent 4: SessionName III (Sepsis)

Wait, no. Looking back:

Respondent 7's SessionName is ""III-Sepsis""
Respondent 3's SessionName is ""III-Sepsis""
Respondent 4's SessionName is ""III (Sepsis)""

So ""III-Sepsis"" and ""III (Sepsis)"" are different. Similarly, ""II-Anaphylaxsis"", ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"", ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"", and ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" are all different sessions. So each of these is a separate group.

Now, let's list each SessionName group and their Background (examination) scores:

1. II-Anaphylaxsis: Only Respondent 23 with score 2. Average is 2. So any respondent in this group with score >2 would be included. But since the only one is 2, none here.

2. III-Sepsis: Respondents 7 (3), 3 (3), and 4 (2). Wait, no. Wait, Respondent 4's SessionName is ""III (Sepsis)"", which is a different group. So III-Sepsis group has Respondents 7 and 3. Let me check:

Wait, Respondent 7: SessionName III-Sepsis
Respondent 3: SessionName III-Sepsis
Respondent 4: SessionName III (Sepsis)

So ""III-Sepsis"" and ""III (Sepsis)"" are different. So the III-Sepsis group has two respondents: 7 (3) and 3 (3). The average for this group is (3 + 3)/2 = 3. So any respondent in this group with a score >3 would be included. But both have 3, so none here.

The III (Sepsis) group has Respondent 4 with a score of 2. Average is 2. So no one here either.

3. IV (VT): Respondent 22 with score 3. Average is 3. No one above.

4. II (Anaphylaxsis): Respondent 9 with score 2. Average is 2. No.

5. II (Anaphylactic Shock): Respondent 6 with score 3. Average is 3. No.

6. II (Anaphylaxis): Respondent 12 with score 3. Average is 3. No.

Wait, but wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recheck all the SessionNames and their groupings:

Looking at all respondents:

- Respondent 23: SessionName II-Anaphylaxsis
- Respondent 7: III-Sepsis
- Respondent 22: IV (VT)
- Respondent 9: II (Anaphylaxsis)
- Respondent 3: III-Sepsis
- Respondent 4: III (Sepsis)
- Respondent 6: II (Anaphylactic Shock)
- Respondent 12: II (Anaphylaxis)

So each SessionName is unique except for III-Sepsis (Respondents 7 and 3) and II (Anaphylaxsis) vs. II-Anaphylaxsis (different). Wait, no. ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" and ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"" are different. So each of these is a separate group. Similarly, ""III-Sepsis"" and ""III (Sepsis)"" are different.

So for each group:

1. II-Anaphylaxsis: 1 respondent, score 2. Avg 2. No one above.
2. III-Sepsis: 2 respondents (7 and 3), scores 3 and 3. Avg 3. No one above.
3. IV (VT): 1 respondent, score 3. Avg 3. No.
4. II (Anaphylaxsis): 1 respondent, score 2. Avg 2. No.
5. III (Sepsis): 1 respondent (4), score 2. Avg 2. No.
6. II (Anaphylactic Shock): 1 respondent (6), score 3. Avg 3. No.
7. II (Anaphylaxis): 1 respondent (12), score 3. Avg 3. No.

So in all groups, no respondent has a Background (examination) score higher than the average of their session. Therefore, the answer should be that there are no such respondents. But wait, let me check again to make sure I didn't miss any.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in grouping. Let me list all SessionNames and their corresponding Background (examination) scores again:

- II-Anaphylaxsis: 2 (Respondent 23)
- III-Sepsis: 3 (Respondent 7), 3 (Respondent 3)
- IV (VT): 3 (Respondent 22)
- II (Anaphylaxsis): 2 (Respondent 9)
- III (Sepsis): 2 (Respondent 4)
- II (Anaphylactic Shock): 3 (Respondent 6)
- II (Anaphylaxis): 3 (Respondent 12)

Each of these is a separate group. For each group, the average is the same as the individual scores because most groups have only one respondent. The groups with multiple respondents are III-Sepsis (two respondents with scores 3 and 3, average 3). So in that group, both have scores equal to the average, not above. Therefore, no one in any group has a score higher than the average. Hence, the answer is that there are no respondents meeting the criteria.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents whose 'Background (history)' is within 1 point of the lowest 'Identification' for their session name.
