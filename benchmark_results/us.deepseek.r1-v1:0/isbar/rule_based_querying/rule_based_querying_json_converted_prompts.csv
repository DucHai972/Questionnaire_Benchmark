<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents from the '(MI)-VT' session whose 'Identification' is exactly 0.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to list all respondents from the '(MI)-VT' session whose 'Identification' score is exactly 0. 

First, I need to look at the data provided. The responses array has several entries. Each respondent has a 'SessionName' in their answers. I need to filter those where the SessionName is exactly '(MI)-VT'. 

Looking through the responses:

- Respondent 16: SessionName is ""I - MI"" – not matching.
- Respondent 7: ""III-Sepsis"" – nope.
- Respondent 11: ""IV (AF)"" – no.
- Respondent 10: SessionName is ""(MI)-VT"" – that's a match.
- Respondent 1: ""V (Hypoglycemia)"" – not.
- Respondent 22: ""IV (VT)"" – close but not exact.
- Respondent 18: ""IV - VT"" – different formatting.
- Respondent 4: ""III (Sepsis)"" – no.

So only respondent 10 is in the '(MI)-VT' session. Now, check their 'Identification' score. The answer for respondent 10's Identification is 2. The task asks for exactly 0. Since 2 is not 0, there are no respondents that meet both criteria. 

Therefore, the answer should be an empty list.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents from the 'MI' session whose 'Assessment' is exactly 2.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to list all respondents from the 'MI' session whose 'Assessment' is exactly 2. 

First, I need to understand the data structure provided. The dataset has a 'questions' section that defines each field and a 'responses' array containing each respondent's answers. 

Looking at the 'SessionName' in the questions, it's an open-ended field asking for the name of the session. The 'Assessment' question is a rubric with scores from 0 to 3. The task requires filtering responses where the 'SessionName' is exactly 'MI' and the 'Assessment' score is 2.

Now, I'll go through each response in the 'responses' array. For each respondent, I need to check two things: 
1. Does the 'SessionName' match 'MI' exactly?
2. Is the 'Assessment' score exactly 2?

Starting with respondent 7: SessionName is ""III-Sepsis"" – not MI. Assessment is 2, but session doesn't match. Skip.

Respondent 12: SessionName is ""II (Anaphylaxis)"". Not MI. Assessment is 2, but session is wrong. Skip.

Respondent 11: SessionName ""IV (AF)"". Not MI. Assessment 3. Doesn't meet criteria.

Respondent 14: SessionName ""IV-Hypoglycemia"". Not MI. Assessment 3. No.

Respondent 2: SessionName ""MI"". That's a match. Now check Assessment. Their Assessment is 3. So even though the session is correct, the score is 3, not 2. So exclude.

Respondent 8: SessionName ""III (Sepsis)"". Not MI. Assessment 2. Session doesn't match.

Respondent 5: SessionName ""II - Anaphylaxsis"". Not MI. Assessment 3. No.

Respondent 1: SessionName ""V (Hypoglycemia)"". Not MI. Assessment 3. Skip.

Respondent 17: SessionName ""V (Hypoglycemia)"". Not MI. Assessment 3. No.

Respondent 9: SessionName ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"". Not MI. Assessment 2. Session doesn't match.

After checking all respondents, none of them are in the 'MI' session with an Assessment score of exactly 2. The only respondent in the 'MI' session is respondent 2, but their Assessment is 3. Therefore, the answer should be an empty list.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
List all respondents from the 'II (Anaphylaxis)' session whose 'Identification' is exactly 0.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to list all respondents from the 'II (Anaphylaxis)' session whose 'Identification' score is exactly 0. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The data has a 'responses' array where each entry is a respondent with their answers. Each respondent has a 'respondent' ID and an 'answers' object containing various fields. The key fields here are 'SessionName' and 'Identification'.

The 'SessionName' needs to exactly match 'II (Anaphylaxis)'. I should check each response's 'SessionName' under 'answers' to see if it matches. But wait, I need to be careful about possible variations in the session names. For example, in the example given, there's a session named ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"" which might be a typo, but in the data provided, the correct session we're looking for is 'II (Anaphylaxis)'. Let me check the responses.

Looking at the responses:

- Respondent 9: SessionName is ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"" – note the double 's' in Anaphylaxsis. That's probably a typo, but according to the data, it's spelled that way. However, the task specifies 'II (Anaphylaxis)', so this might not be a match unless it's a typo in the data. But since we have to go by the exact data, this might not be considered a match.

- Respondent 6: SessionName is ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"" – different session name.

- Respondent 12: SessionName is ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" – this matches exactly.

Other respondents have different session names like ""I - MI"", ""IV (VT)"", etc.

So, only respondent 12 has the exact 'SessionName' of 'II (Anaphylaxis)'.

Next, check the 'Identification' score for respondent 12. The 'Identification' field in their answers is 3. The task requires exactly 0. So this respondent doesn't meet the criteria.

Wait, are there any other respondents with SessionName 'II (Anaphylaxis)'? Let me check again. Respondent 12 is the only one. The others with similar names are 9 (Anaphylaxsis) and 6 (Anaphylactic Shock), which are different.

Now, check if any other respondents in the 'II (Anaphylaxis)' session have Identification 0. Since only respondent 12 is in that session and their Identification is 3, there are none. 

Additionally, looking through all responses, the only respondent with an 'Identification' score of 0 is respondent 3. But their SessionName is ""III-Sepsis"", which doesn't match. So no one in the 'II (Anaphylaxis)' session has Identification 0.

Therefore, the answer should be an empty list.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents from the 'III-Sepsis' session whose 'Background (examination)' is exactly 2.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to list all respondents from the 'III-Sepsis' session who have a 'Background (examination)' score of exactly 2. 

First, I need to understand the data structure provided. The data has a 'responses' array where each entry represents a respondent. Each respondent has an 'answers' object containing various fields, including 'SessionName' and 'Background (examination)'. 

The key steps here are:
1. Filter the responses to find those where the 'SessionName' is exactly 'III-Sepsis'. 
2. From those filtered responses, check if their 'Background (examination)' score is exactly 2.
3. Collect the 'respondent' identifiers for those who meet both criteria.

Looking at the data, let's go through each respondent:

1. **Respondent 3**: SessionName is ""III-Sepsis"". Background (examination) is 3. Doesn't meet the score of 2.
2. **Respondent 7**: SessionName is ""III-Sepsis"". Background (examination) is 3. Again, score is 3, so no.
3. **Respondent 15**: SessionName is ""III - Sepsis"". Wait, the session name here has a space and hyphen. The task specifies 'III-Sepsis' exactly. The hyphen here is with spaces, so ""III - Sepsis"" might be considered different. But maybe it's a typo? Need to check if the session names are standardized. Looking at other entries, like respondent 3 and 7, their SessionName is ""III-Sepsis"" without spaces. Respondent 15's SessionName is ""III - Sepsis"" with spaces. Depending on exact matching, this might be a different session. So respondent 15 might not be included. But perhaps the user intended to consider variations. However, the task says 'III-Sepsis' exactly. So ""III - Sepsis"" is different. Therefore, respondent 15 is not part of the 'III-Sepsis' session. So we can exclude them.

Now, checking other respondents for SessionName. The rest have different session names like ""II - Anaphylaxsis"", ""V (Hypoglycemia)"", etc. So only respondents 3, 7, and 15 have session names related to Sepsis. But 3 and 7 are ""III-Sepsis"", 15 is ""III - Sepsis"". 

So among the 'III-Sepsis' sessions (exact match), only respondents 3 and 7. But their Background (examination) scores are 3 and 3 respectively. Neither has a score of 2. 

Wait, but wait. Let me check again. The task is to find respondents in 'III-Sepsis' with Background (examination) exactly 2. Looking through all responses:

- Respondent 3: SessionName ""III-Sepsis"", Background (examination) 3.
- Respondent 7: SessionName ""III-Sepsis"", Background (examination) 3.
- Respondent 15: SessionName ""III - Sepsis"", Background (examination) 3.

No one in the exact 'III-Sepsis' session has a Background (examination) of 2. Therefore, the answer should be an empty list. 

But wait, let me check again. Maybe I missed someone. Let's go through all responses again:

Respondent 3: III-Sepsis, exam 3.
Respondent 5: II - Anaphylaxsis.
Respondent 1: V (Hypoglycemia).
Respondent 7: III-Sepsis, exam 3.
Respondent 17: V (Hypoglycemia).
Respondent 15: III - Sepsis (different from III-Sepsis), exam 3.
Respondent 12: II (Anaphylaxis).
Respondent 2: MI.

No one else. So no respondents meet both criteria. Therefore, the answer is an empty list.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'Assessment' score is between 0 and 1.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task. I need to find all respondents whose 'Assessment' score is between 0 and 1. First, I should check the schema to understand what the 'Assessment' field entails.

Looking at the questions section, the 'Assessment' question is: ""Makes logical assessment (correlates problem, history, exam, context). [Rubric: 0 = No logical assessment, 1 = Assessment only after extended questioning, 2 = Assessment after minimal questioning, 3 = Comprehensive logical assessment without questioning]"". So the possible scores are 0, 1, 2, or 3. The task is to find respondents with scores between 0 and 1, which includes 0 and 1.

Now, I need to go through each response in the 'responses' array and check the 'Assessment' value. Let's list them out one by one.

Respondent 22: Assessment is 2. That's outside the range.
Respondent 16: Assessment is 3. Not in range.
Respondent 1: Assessment is 3. No.
Respondent 21: Assessment is 2. Nope.
Respondent 18: Assessment is 3. Not included.
Respondent 19: Assessment is 2. Still no.
Respondent 14: Assessment is 3. Not in range.
Respondent 20: Assessment is 3. No.
Respondent 23: Assessment is 3. Not applicable.
Respondent 9: Assessment is 2. Doesn't fit.
Respondent 12: Assessment is 2. No.
Respondent 5: Assessment is 3. Not in the range.

Wait, none of the respondents have an 'Assessment' score of 0 or 1. All the scores are either 2 or 3. So there are no respondents that meet the criteria. The answer should be an empty list.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'Assessment' score is between 0 and 1.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task. I need to find all respondents whose 'Assessment' score is between 0 and 1. First, I should check the schema to understand what the 'Assessment' field entails.

Looking at the questions section, the 'Assessment' question is: ""Makes logical assessment (correlates problem, history, exam, context). [Rubric: 0 = No logical assessment, 1 = Assessment only after extended questioning, 2 = Assessment after minimal questioning, 3 = Comprehensive logical assessment without questioning]"". So the possible scores are 0, 1, 2, or 3. The task is to find respondents with scores between 0 and 1. That would include scores 0 and 1, right? Because ""between"" in this context likely means inclusive. So any respondent with an 'Assessment' of 0 or 1.

Now, I need to go through each response in the data and check their 'Assessment' score. Let's look at each response one by one.

Respondent 20: 'Assessment' is 3. That's outside the range, so no.

Respondent 17: 'Assessment' is 3. Also no.

Respondent 9: 'Assessment' is 2. Still no.

Respondent 12: 'Assessment' is 2. Nope.

Respondent 21: 'Assessment' is 2. Not in range.

Respondent 13: 'Assessment' is 2. Again, no.

Respondent 3: 'Assessment' is 3. Not applicable.

Respondent 23: 'Assessment' is 3. Also not.

Wait, none of the respondents have an 'Assessment' score of 0 or 1. Let me double-check each entry to be sure. 

Looking again:

- Respondent 3 has an 'Assessment' of 3. 
- All others have 2 or 3. 

So there are no respondents with an 'Assessment' score between 0 and 1. Therefore, the answer should be an empty list.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents from the 'MI' session whose 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is exactly 0.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to list all respondents from the 'MI' session whose 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is exactly 0. 

First, I need to understand the data structure provided. The dataset has a 'questions' section that defines each field and a 'responses' array containing each respondent's answers. 

The key points here are:
1. Identify which sessions are considered 'MI' sessions.
2. Check each respondent in those sessions for a 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' score of exactly 0.

Starting with the first part, the 'SessionName' field in the responses needs to be checked. The example given in the data shows that session names can vary slightly. For instance, there's a session named ""(MI)-VT"", another ""I - MI"", ""I (Myocardial infarction)"", and ""MI"". The task mentions the 'MI' session, but I need to consider all variations that include 'MI' as part of the session name. However, the user specified the exact session name as 'MI', so maybe it's looking for exact matches. Wait, the task says ""the 'MI' session"", but looking at the responses, there's a respondent with SessionName ""MI"" (respondent 2) and others with variations. Wait, the example in the problem statement had a session named ""(MI)-VT"", and the task here is to find 'MI' session. But perhaps the user made a typo, or maybe the exact session name is 'MI'? Let me check the data again.

Looking at the responses:

- Respondent 10: SessionName ""(MI)-VT""
- Respondent 19: ""I - MI""
- Respondent 21: ""I (Myocardial infarction)""
- Respondent 2: ""MI""
- Others have different session names like Sepsis, VT, etc.

The task is to find respondents from the 'MI' session. The exact session name ""MI"" is present in respondent 2. However, sometimes session names might have variations, but the user might be referring to any session that includes 'MI' in the name. But the example given in the problem statement was looking for '(MI)-VT' session, which suggests that the session names can have different formats. However, the current task is to find the 'MI' session, which is a specific session name. So I need to check for exact matches to ""MI"" in the SessionName field.

Wait, but in the data, respondent 2's SessionName is ""MI"", while others have variations. So the 'MI' session is exactly that. So first, filter all responses where SessionName is exactly ""MI"".

Next, for those respondents in the 'MI' session, check their 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' score. The question defines this as a rubric where 0 means ""Not at all confident"". We need to find respondents where this score is exactly 0.

Looking at the responses:

Respondent 2 has SessionName ""MI"" and 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is 1. So that's not 0.

Respondent 19: SessionName ""I - MI"" – not exact ""MI"", so excluded.

Respondent 21: ""I (Myocardial infarction)"" – also not exact ""MI"".

Respondent 10: ""(MI)-VT"" – not exact ""MI"".

So in the data provided, the only respondent with SessionName exactly ""MI"" is respondent 2, but their global rating is 1, not 0. Therefore, there are no respondents in the 'MI' session with a global rating scale of 0.

Wait, but the task might have a typo. The example in the problem was looking for '(MI)-VT' session. Maybe the user intended to ask for that session again. But the current task says 'MI' session. However, following the instructions strictly, I should go by what's written. So if the task is to find 'MI' session (exact match), then there are no respondents with a global rating of 0. But let me double-check all responses again.

Looking through each response:

- Respondent 15: III - Sepsis
- 19: I - MI
- 8: III (Sepsis)
- 21: I (Myocardial infarction)
- 10: (MI)-VT
- 3: III-Sepsis
- 2: MI
- 18: IV - VT
- 7: III-Sepsis
- 23: II-Anaphylaxsis
- 14: IV-Hypoglycemia

Only respondent 2 has SessionName ""MI"". Their 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is 1. So no one in the 'MI' session has a score of 0. Therefore, the answer is an empty list.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents from the 'V (Hypoglycemia)' session whose 'Background (examination)' is exactly 1.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The user wants a list of respondents from the 'V (Hypoglycemia)' session who have a 'Background (examination)' score of exactly 1. 

First, I need to look through the responses provided. Each response has a 'SessionName' and various answers. The key here is to filter the responses where the 'SessionName' matches exactly 'V (Hypoglycemia)' and the 'Background (examination)' value is 1.

Looking at the responses array, I'll go through each respondent one by one. 

Starting with respondent 2: Their SessionName is ""MI"", so that's not a match. 

Respondent 3 has ""III-Sepsis"" – nope. 

Respondent 9: ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"" – not matching. 

Respondent 18: ""IV - VT"" – skip. 

Respondent 19: ""I - MI"" – not it. 

Respondent 23: ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" – no. 

Respondent 6: ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"" – not matching. 

Respondent 11: ""IV (AF)"" – nope. 

Then respondent 1: Their SessionName is ""V (Hypoglycemia)"", which matches exactly. Now check the 'Background (examination)' score. The answer here is 2. Wait, the task requires exactly 1. So this respondent doesn't meet the criteria. 

Wait, let me double-check. The 'Background (examination)' for respondent 1 is listed as 2. So even though the session name is correct, the score isn't 1. 

Looking through all the responses again, I don't see any other entries with SessionName 'V (Hypoglycemia)'. The only one is respondent 1, but their Background (examination) is 2, not 1. 

Therefore, there are no respondents that meet both conditions. The answer should be an empty list.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
List all respondents from the 'I (Myocardial infarction)' session whose 'Background (examination)' is exactly 3.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to list all respondents from the 'I (Myocardial infarction)' session who have a 'Background (examination)' score of exactly 3. 

First, I need to understand the data structure provided. The dataset has a 'responses' array where each entry represents a respondent. Each respondent has an 'answers' object containing various fields, including 'SessionName' and 'Background (examination)'. 

The first step is to filter the respondents based on the 'SessionName'. The session we're interested in is 'I (Myocardial infarction)'. I'll go through each respondent's 'SessionName' to check for an exact match. 

Looking at the responses:

1. Respondent 21: SessionName is ""I (Myocardial infarction)"".
2. Respondent 9: SessionName is ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"".
3. Respondent 15: SessionName is ""III - Sepsis"".
4. Respondent 16: SessionName is ""I - MI"".
5. Respondent 8: SessionName is ""III (Sepsis)"".

So, the sessions that might be relevant are respondents 21 and 16. However, the exact session name required is 'I (Myocardial infarction)'. Respondent 16's session is ""I - MI"", which might be an abbreviation. But according to the data, the exact name in the question is 'I (Myocardial infarction)', so only respondent 21 matches exactly here.

Next, for these respondents, check the 'Background (examination)' score. The requirement is that the score must be exactly 3. 

Looking at respondent 21's 'Background (examination)': it's 1. So that doesn't meet the criteria. 

Wait, but respondent 16's 'Background (examination)' is 3. However, their SessionName is ""I - MI"". Now, the question is whether ""I - MI"" is considered the same as ""I (Myocardial infarction)"". Since MI stands for Myocardial Infarction, but the session names are written differently. The task specifies the exact session name as 'I (Myocardial infarction)', so ""I - MI"" might not be an exact match. Therefore, respondent 16's session name is different. 

So, among all respondents, only respondent 21 has the exact session name 'I (Myocardial infarction)', but their 'Background (examination)' score is 1, not 3. Therefore, there are no respondents that meet both criteria. 

Wait, but maybe I should check if there are other respondents with SessionName variations that might still be considered part of the 'I (Myocardial infarction)' session. For example, respondent 16's session is ""I - MI"". If MI is an abbreviation for Myocardial Infarction, perhaps the user considers them the same. But according to the data provided, the session names are distinct. The example in the data shows that ""I (Myocardial infarction)"" and ""I - MI"" are different entries. For instance, in the example, the answer was an empty list because the session was '(MI)-VT', which wasn't present. So, exact matching is required here. 

Therefore, only respondent 21 is in the 'I (Myocardial infarction)' session, but their 'Background (examination)' is 1. Hence, no respondents meet both conditions. The answer should be an empty list.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents from the 'II - Anaphylaxsis' session whose 'Background (examination)' is exactly 1.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to list all respondents from the 'II - Anaphylaxsis' session whose 'Background (examination)' score is exactly 1. 

First, I need to understand the data structure provided. There's a 'responses' array where each entry represents a respondent. Each respondent has an 'answers' object containing various fields, including 'SessionName' and 'Background (examination)'. 

The key steps here are:
1. Filter the responses to find those where the 'SessionName' exactly matches 'II - Anaphylaxsis'.
2. From those filtered responses, check if their 'Background (examination)' score is exactly 1.
3. Collect the 'respondent' IDs that meet both criteria.

Looking at the data, let's go through each respondent:

1. **Respondent 3**: SessionName is ""III-Sepsis"". Doesn't match. Skip.
2. **Respondent 9**: SessionName is ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"". The spelling here is ""Anaphylaxsis"" with double 's', but the target session is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"". The hyphen vs. parentheses might be a formatting difference, but the spelling of the condition is important. Wait, the target session is 'II - Anaphylaxsis', but respondent 9's session is ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"". The condition is spelled ""Anaphylaxsis"" here. However, looking at respondent 5, their SessionName is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"". So there's a possible typo in the session names. The task specifies 'II - Anaphylaxsis', so we need to match exactly. Respondent 9's session name uses parentheses and has a different spelling (Anaphylaxsis vs. Anaphylaxsis? Wait, both are spelled ""Anaphylaxsis"" but the formatting is different. Wait, no, the task says 'II - Anaphylaxsis', and respondent 5's session is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"". Respondent 9's is ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"". So the session names are different in formatting but the condition name might be a typo. Wait, ""Anaphylaxsis"" is likely a typo for ""Anaphylaxis"". But according to the data provided, the exact session names are as written. So the task is looking for 'II - Anaphylaxsis', which is exactly what respondent 5 has. Respondent 9's session is ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"", which is a different string. So only respondent 5's session matches exactly. 

Next, check the 'Background (examination)' score for respondent 5. Their score is 3, which is not 1. So they don't meet the second condition. 

Now, check other respondents. Respondent 13's session is ""I-VF"", 21 is ""I (Myocardial infarction)"", 20 is ""IV (VT)"". None of these match 'II - Anaphylaxsis'. 

Wait, but maybe the session names have variations. Let me double-check. The task is looking for 'II - Anaphylaxsis'. In the data, respondent 5's SessionName is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"", and respondent 9's is ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"". The hyphen vs. parentheses and the extra 's' in Anaphylaxsis (if that's a typo) might be a factor. But according to the data as given, the exact strings are different. So only respondent 5's session matches exactly. 

Now, looking at 'Background (examination)' for respondent 5: it's 3. So they don't meet the score of 1. 

Are there any other respondents in 'II - Anaphylaxsis'? No. So even though the task is to find those in that session with a Background examination of 1, there are none. 

Wait, but let's check all respondents again. Respondent 9's session is ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"", which might be a typo for ""II - Anaphylaxis"", but the task specifies 'II - Anaphylaxsis'. So unless there's a typo in the task, we have to take the session name as given. Therefore, no respondents in the exact session 'II - Anaphylaxsis' have a Background examination score of 1. 

Additionally, looking at other respondents, respondent 13's Background examination is 1, but their session is ""I-VF"". Respondent 21's Background examination is 1, but their session is ""I (Myocardial infarction)"". So none of them are in the correct session. 

Therefore, the answer is that there are no respondents meeting both criteria.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents from the 'MI' session whose 'Background (history)' is exactly 0.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to list all respondents from the 'MI' session whose 'Background (history)' is exactly 0. 

First, I need to understand the data structure provided. The dataset has a 'questions' section that defines each field and a 'responses' array containing each respondent's answers. 

The key points here are:
1. Identify respondents from the 'MI' session.
2. Check if their 'Background (history)' score is exactly 0.

Starting with the first part, I need to look through each response in the 'responses' array and check the 'SessionName' field. The task specifies the session as 'MI', so I need to match that exactly. However, I should be cautious about possible variations in the session names. For example, in the data, there's a session named ""III-Sepsis"" and another as ""III - Sepsis"", which are similar but have different formatting. The example given in the task is '(MI)-VT', but the current task is looking for 'MI' specifically. 

Looking at the responses:
- Respondent 2 has SessionName ""MI"".
- Respondent 10 has SessionName ""(MI)-VT"".
- Respondent 21 has SessionName ""I (Myocardial infarction)"".

The task is about 'MI' session, so only respondent 2's SessionName is exactly ""MI"". The others have variations like ""(MI)-VT"" or ""Myocardial infarction"", which are different.

Next, for each respondent in the 'MI' session, check their 'Background (history)' score. The 'Background (history)' is a rubric with possible scores 0-3. The task requires exactly 0.

Looking at respondent 2's data:
- 'Background (history)': 2. 

Since 2 is not 0, this respondent doesn't meet the criteria. 

Now, check all other responses to see if any have 'Background (history)' as 0. Let's go through each response:

- Respondent 12: Background (history) = 3
- Respondent 4: 3
- Respondent 3: 3
- Respondent 1: 2
- Respondent 10: 2
- Respondent 15: 2
- Respondent 23: 2
- Respondent 9: 2
- Respondent 2: 2 (already checked)
- Respondent 21: 3

None of the respondents have a 'Background (history)' score of 0. Therefore, there are no respondents that meet both criteria: being in the 'MI' session and having a 'Background (history)' of 0.

Wait, but I should double-check if there are any other sessions that might be considered 'MI' but have different names. For example, respondent 21's session is ""I (Myocardial infarction)"". Myocardial infarction is MI, but the session name here is written out. However, the task specifies the session name as 'MI', not the condition. So unless the session name is exactly 'MI', it doesn't count. Therefore, respondent 21's session is not 'MI' but ""I (Myocardial infarction)"", which is a different session name.

Therefore, the final answer is that there are no respondents meeting the criteria.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondents from sessions on '2025-05-04' have a 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' of 1 and a 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' of less than 2?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find which respondents from sessions on '2025-05-04' have a 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' of 1 and a 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' of less than 2. 

First, I need to parse the data provided. Let's look at the responses array. Each respondent has an answers object with various fields. The key fields here are Date, SessionName, 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)', and 'Recommendation (global rating scale)'.

The date we're interested in is '2025-05-04'. So I need to filter all respondents where the Date in their answers is exactly '2025-05-04'.

Next, for those respondents, check two things: 
1. Their 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' score must be exactly 1.
2. Their 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' score must be less than 2. Since the rubric for the global rating scale is 0-3, less than 2 would be 0 or 1.

Now, let's go through each respondent in the responses array and check these conditions.

Looking at the first respondent (respondent 6): Date is 2025-04-04, which doesn't match. Skip.

Respondent 14: Date is 2025-03-14. Not our target date. Skip.

Respondent 15: Date is 2025-05-04. Let's check their recommendations. 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' is 2, which is not 1. So they don't qualify. The global rating scale here is 2, which is not less than 2. So even if the clear recommendation was 1, the global rating is 2, which doesn't meet the second condition. So this one is out.

Respondent 18: Date is 2025-05-04. 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' is 2. Not 1. So no.

Respondent 20: Date is 2025-05-02. Not the target date. Skip.

Respondent 17: Date is 2025-05-04. 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' is 3. So that's higher than 1. Doesn't meet the first condition. The global rating is 2, which again is not less than 2. So no.

Wait, are there any other respondents with date 2025-05-04? Let me check again. Respondents 15, 18, and 17 have that date. 

Looking at their 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)':
- 15: 2
- 18: 2
- 17: 3

None of these are 1. So there are no respondents from 2025-05-04 with 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' of 1. Therefore, even if their global rating scale was less than 2, which none of them are (they have 2, 2, and 2 respectively), there's no one matching both conditions.

Wait, but the global rating scale for respondent 17 is 2, which is not less than 2. So even if someone had a clear recommendation of 1, but their global rating is 2, they wouldn't qualify. But in this case, there are no respondents on the target date with clear recommendation 1. So the answer should be an empty list.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondents from sessions on '2025-03-14' have a 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' of 3 and a 'Identification' of less than 2?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find which respondents from the sessions on '2025-03-14' have a 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' of 3 and an 'Identification' score of less than 2. 

First, I need to look at the data provided. The responses array has multiple entries. Each respondent has a set of answers with various fields. The key here is to filter the respondents based on two criteria: the date of the session, the global rating scale, and the identification score.

Starting with the date. The question specifies '2025-03-14'. So I need to go through each response and check if the 'Date' in their answers matches this exact date. Let's look at the responses:

Looking at the list:
- Respondent 4: Date is 2025-05-16 → Not a match.
- Respondent 1: 2025-05-02 → No.
- Respondent 3: 2025-04-04 → No.
- Respondent 12: 2025-05-02 → No.
- Respondent 18: 2025-05-04 → No.
- Respondent 21: 2025-05-16 → No.
- Respondent 11: 2025-04-04 → No.
- Respondent 13: 2025-03-14 → Yes.
- Respondent 22: 2025-05-16 → No.
- Respondent 5: 2025-05-04 → No.
- Respondent 7: 2025-03-14 → Yes.

So respondents 13 and 7 are the ones who have sessions on 2025-03-14.

Next, check their 'Recommendation (global rating scale)'. The question requires this to be exactly 3. Let's check each of these two respondents:

- Respondent 13: Their 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is 2. So this doesn't meet the criteria.
- Respondent 7: Their 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is 2 as well. So neither of them have a score of 3 here.

Wait, that's a problem. The task asks for a global rating scale of 3. But both respondents on 2025-03-14 (13 and 7) have a score of 2. So there are no respondents from that date with a global rating scale of 3. 

But let's double-check to make sure I didn't miss any other respondents. The other dates are all different, so only 13 and 7 are on 2025-03-14. Both have global rating scale 2. 

Additionally, the 'Identification' score needs to be less than 2. Let's check that for these two:

- Respondent 13: 'Identification' is 3. 3 is not less than 2, so this doesn't meet the criteria.
- Respondent 7: 'Identification' is 3. Same here. So even if their global rating was 3, their Identification is 3, which is not less than 2. 

Wait, but the task is to find respondents on 2025-03-14 with global rating 3 AND Identification less than 2. But in the data, there are no respondents on that date with global rating 3, and even if there were, their Identification scores are 3. So the answer should be that there are no such respondents. 

But let me check again. Are there any other respondents on 2025-03-14? The data shows respondents 13 and 7. Both have global rating 2. So no one meets both criteria. Therefore, the answer is an empty list.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondents from sessions on '2025-05-04' have a 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' of 2 and a 'Situation' of less than 2?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The task is to find which respondents from the sessions on '2025-05-04' have a 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' of exactly 2 and a 'Situation' score of less than 2. 

First, I need to look at the data provided. Let's start by filtering the responses to only those with the date '2025-05-04'. Looking through the responses, I see that respondent 9 and 15 have the date 2025-05-04. The others are on different dates like 2025-05-02 or 2025-03-14, so they can be excluded.

Next, for these two respondents (9 and 15), I need to check their 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and 'Situation' scores. 

Starting with respondent 9: 
- 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' is 3. The question asks for exactly 2, so this doesn't meet the criteria. 
- 'Situation' is 3, which is not less than 2. So respondent 9 is out.

Now respondent 15:
- 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' is 2. That's a match.
- 'Situation' is 3, which again is not less than 2. So this also doesn't meet the criteria.

Wait, but both respondents on 2025-05-04 have 'Situation' scores of 3. The task requires 'Situation' to be less than 2. Since neither of them have a 'Situation' score below 2, there are no respondents that meet both conditions. 

Therefore, the answer should be an empty list.
</think>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondents from sessions on '2025-05-16' have a 'Background (history)' of 3 and a 'Background (examination)' of less than 2?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find which respondents from sessions on '2025-05-16' have a 'Background (history)' score of exactly 3 and a 'Background (examination)' score of less than 2. 

First, I need to go through each response in the provided data and check if they meet these criteria. Let's start by filtering the responses by the date. The date we're looking for is '2025-05-16'. 

Looking at the responses list, there's one respondent with the date '2025-05-16': respondent 19. The other responses have different dates, so they can be excluded from consideration.

Now, for respondent 19, I need to check their 'Background (history)' and 'Background (examination)' scores. According to their answers, 'Background (history)' is 3, which meets the first condition. The 'Background (examination)' is also 3. Wait, the second condition is that 'Background (examination)' should be less than 2. Since 3 is not less than 2, this respondent doesn't meet both conditions. 

Hmm, maybe I missed another respondent. Let me check again. The other responses on different dates: 2025-05-04, 2025-03-14, 2025-05-02, 2025-04-04. None of these are 2025-05-16 except respondent 19. 

Wait, respondent 20 has a date of 2025-05-02. No, that's not the right date. So the only respondent on 2025-05-16 is 19, but their 'Background (examination)' is 3, which doesn't meet the less than 2 requirement. 

Therefore, there are no respondents who meet both criteria. The answer should be an empty list.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents whose 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is within 1 point of the lowest 'Assessment' for their session name.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondents have a total score across all rubric items that is higher than the average total score for all respondents?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find which respondents have a total score across all rubric items that's higher than the average total score for all respondents. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The dataset has a 'questions' section that defines each rubric item and a 'responses' array with each respondent's answers. The rubric items are the ones with numerical scores, so I need to identify which fields in the responses are part of the scoring.

Looking at the 'questions' section, the rubric items are:
- Identification (0-3)
- Situation (0-3)
- Background (history) (0-3)
- Background (examination) (0-3)
- Assessment (0-3)
- Recommendation (clear recommendation) (0-3)
- Recommendation (global rating scale) (0-3)

The other fields like Date, SessionName, and Comments are open-ended and not part of the scoring. So each respondent has 7 rubric items contributing to their total score.

Next, I need to calculate the total score for each respondent. Let's go through each response one by one.

Starting with respondent 17:
- Identification: 3
- Situation: 3
- Background (history): 3
- Background (examination): 3
- Assessment: 3
- Recommendation (clear recommendation): 3
- Recommendation (global rating scale): 2
Total = 3+3+3+3+3+3+2 = 20

Respondent 6:
- Identification: 3
- Situation: 2
- Background (history): 3
- Background (examination): 3
- Assessment: 2
- Recommendation (clear recommendation): 2
- Recommendation (global rating scale): 3
Total = 3+2+3+3+2+2+3 = 18

Respondent 18:
- Identification: 3
- Situation: 3
- Background (history): 2
- Background (examination): 2
- Assessment: 3
- Recommendation (clear recommendation): 2
- Recommendation (global rating scale): 2
Total = 3+3+2+2+3+2+2 = 17

Respondent 22:
- Identification: 3
- Situation: 3
- Background (history): 3
- Background (examination): 3
- Assessment: 2
- Recommendation (clear recommendation): 2
- Recommendation (global rating scale): 3
Total = 3+3+3+3+2+2+3 = 19

Respondent 11:
- All rubric items are 3 except maybe the last one. Let's check:
- Identification: 3
- Situation: 3
- Background (history): 3
- Background (examination): 3
- Assessment: 3
- Recommendation (clear recommendation): 3
- Recommendation (global rating scale): 3
Total = 3*7 = 21

Respondent 21:
- Identification: 3
- Situation: 2
- Background (history): 3
- Background (examination): 1
- Assessment: 2
- Recommendation (clear recommendation): 3
- Recommendation (global rating scale): 3
Total = 3+2+3+1+2+3+3 = 17

Respondent 14:
- Identification: 3
- Situation: 3
- Background (history): 2
- Background (examination): 2
- Assessment: 3
- Recommendation (clear recommendation): 1
- Recommendation (global rating scale): 2
Total = 3+3+2+2+3+1+2 = 16

Respondent 15:
- Identification: 3
- Situation: 3
- Background (history): 2
- Background (examination): 3
- Assessment: 2
- Recommendation (clear recommendation): 2
- Recommendation (global rating scale): 2
Total = 3+3+2+3+2+2+2 = 17

Respondent 4:
- Identification: 3
- Situation: 3
- Background (history): 3
- Background (examination): 2
- Assessment: 2
- Recommendation (clear recommendation): 2
- Recommendation (global rating scale): 2
Total = 3+3+3+2+2+2+2 = 17

Now, let's list all the totals:
- 17: 20
- 6: 18
- 18: 17
- 22: 19
- 11: 21
- 21: 17
- 14: 16
- 15: 17
- 4: 17

Next, calculate the average total score. Sum all the totals and divide by the number of respondents (9).

Sum = 20 + 18 +17 +19 +21 +17 +16 +17 +17 = Let's add step by step:
20 +18 =38
38+17=55
55+19=74
74+21=95
95+17=112
112+16=128
128+17=145
145+17=162

Average = 162 /9 = 18

So the average total score is 18.

Now, find which respondents have a total higher than 18. Looking at the totals:
- 17: 20 >18 → yes
- 6: 18 → equal, not higher
- 18:17 → no
- 22:19 >18 → yes
- 11:21 >18 → yes
- 21:17 → no
- 14:16 → no
- 15:17 → no
- 4:17 → no

So respondents 17, 22, and 11 have totals above the average of 18.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'Background (examination)' is greater than the average 'Background (examination)' for their session name.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find all respondents whose 'Background (examination)' score is greater than the average for their respective session. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The data has a 'responses' array where each respondent has a 'SessionName' and a 'Background (examination)' score. The goal is to group respondents by their session, calculate the average for each session, then compare each respondent's score against their session's average.

Let me start by listing all the sessions and their corresponding 'Background (examination)' scores. 

Looking at the responses:

1. Respondent 23: Session ""II-Anaphylaxsis"", score 2
2. Respondent 7: Session ""III-Sepsis"", score 3
3. Respondent 22: Session ""IV (VT)"", score 3
4. Respondent 9: Session ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"", score 2
5. Respondent 3: Session ""III-Sepsis"", score 3
6. Respondent 4: Session ""III (Sepsis)"", score 2
7. Respondent 6: Session ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"", score 3
8. Respondent 12: Session ""II (Anaphylaxis)"", score 3

Wait, I need to group these sessions properly. Let's note the exact session names as they might vary but could be the same session with different formatting. For example, ""III-Sepsis"" and ""III (Sepsis)"" might be the same session. Similarly, ""II-Anaphylaxsis"", ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"", ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"", and ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" could be variations of the same session name. But the problem states to consider the exact session name as per the data. So, I should treat each unique session name as a separate group.

So, the unique session names are:

- II-Anaphylaxsis
- III-Sepsis
- IV (VT)
- II (Anaphylaxsis)
- III (Sepsis)
- II (Anaphylactic Shock)
- II (Anaphylaxis)

Now, let's calculate the average for each session:

1. II-Anaphylaxsis: Only respondent 23 with score 2. Average = 2.
2. III-Sepsis: Respondents 7 (3) and 3 (3). Average = (3+3)/2 = 3.
3. IV (VT): Respondent 22 with 3. Average =3.
4. II (Anaphylaxsis): Respondent 9 with 2. Average=2.
5. III (Sepsis): Respondent 4 with 2. Average=2.
6. II (Anaphylactic Shock): Respondent 6 with 3. Average=3.
7. II (Anaphylaxis): Respondent 12 with 3. Average=3.

Now, for each respondent, check if their score is greater than the session's average.

Let's go through each respondent:

1. Respondent 23: Session II-Anaphylaxsis, score 2. Average is 2. 2 is not greater than 2. So no.
2. Respondent 7: III-Sepsis, score 3. Average 3. 3 not greater. No.
3. Respondent 22: IV (VT), 3. Average 3. No.
4. Respondent 9: II (Anaphylaxsis), 2. Average 2. No.
5. Respondent 3: III-Sepsis, 3. Average 3. No.
6. Respondent 4: III (Sepsis), 2. Average 2. No.
7. Respondent 6: II (Anaphylactic Shock), 3. Average 3. No.
8. Respondent 12: II (Anaphylaxis), 3. Average 3. No.

Wait, all respondents have scores equal to their session's average. So none have a score greater than the average. Therefore, the answer should be an empty list.

But wait, let me double-check. Are there any sessions where a respondent's score is higher than the average?

Looking again:

For example, if a session has an average of 2 and a respondent has 3, but in the data, all sessions with multiple respondents (like III-Sepsis) have both respondents scoring 3, so average 3. Other sessions with single respondents have their score equal to the average. So no one has a score higher than the average. Hence, the answer is no respondents.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents whose 'Background (history)' is within 1 point of the lowest 'Identification' for their session name.
