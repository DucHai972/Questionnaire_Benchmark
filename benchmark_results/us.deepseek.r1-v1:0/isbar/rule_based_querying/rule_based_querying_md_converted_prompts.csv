</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".

</output>

<task>
List all respondents from the '(MI)-VT' session whose 'Identification' is exactly 0.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The user wants a list of all respondents from the '(MI)-VT' session where their 'Identification' score is exactly 0. 

First, I need to look through the provided data. Let me start by checking each respondent's SessionName to see if it matches '(MI)-VT'. 

Looking at the responses:

- Respondent 16: SessionName is ""I - MI"" – not matching.
- Respondent 7: ""III-Sepsis"" – nope.
- Respondent 11: ""IV (AF)"" – not it.
- Respondent 10: SessionName is ""(MI)-VT"" – that's a match.
- Respondent 1: ""V (Hypoglycemia)"" – no.
- Respondent 22: ""IV (VT)"" – close but not the same.
- Respondent 18: ""IV - VT"" – different formatting.
- Respondent 4: ""III (Sepsis)"" – not relevant.

So only Respondent 10 is in the '(MI)-VT' session. Now, check their 'Identification' score. Respondent 10's Identification is 2. The task requires exactly 0. Since none of the respondents in the '(MI)-VT' session have Identification 0, the answer should be an empty list.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents from the 'MI' session whose 'Assessment' is exactly 2.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The user wants a list of respondents from the 'MI' session with an 'Assessment' score exactly equal to 2. 

First, I need to look through all the responses provided. Let me go through each respondent one by one.

Starting with Respondent 7: Their SessionName is III-Sepsis. That's not MI, so skip.

Respondent 12: SessionName is II (Anaphylaxis). Not MI.

Respondent 11: IV (AF). Nope.

Respondent 14: IV-Hypoglycemia. Still not MI.

Respondent 2: Here, the SessionName is MI. Now check the Assessment score. Their Assessment is 3. The task requires exactly 2, so this one doesn't qualify.

Respondent 8: III (Sepsis). Not MI.

Respondent 5: II - Anaphylaxsis. Not MI.

Respondent 1: V (Hypoglycemia). No.

Respondent 17: V (Hypoglycemia). No.

Respondent 9: II (Anaphylaxsis). Not MI.

Wait, did I miss any? Let me double-check. The MI session is only listed under Respondent 2. Their Assessment is 3, so no one in the MI session has an Assessment of 2. Therefore, the answer should be an empty list.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents from the 'II (Anaphylaxis)' session whose 'Identification' is exactly 0.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The user wants a list of all respondents from the 'II (Anaphylaxis)' session where their 'Identification' score is exactly 0. 

First, I need to look through all the respondents in the provided data. Let me go through each respondent one by one.

Starting with Respondent 9: Their SessionName is ""II (Anaphylaxsis)""—wait, that's spelled with an extra 's' maybe? The task is looking for ""II (Anaphylaxis)"", so the spelling has to match exactly. Also, their Identification is 3, which doesn't meet the 0 requirement. So, skip this one.

Respondent 16: SessionName is ""I - MI"". Not the right session. Identification is 3. Not relevant.

Respondent 21: SessionName is ""I (Myocardial infarction)"". Nope, not the session we need. Identification is 3.

Respondent 22: SessionName ""IV (VT)"". Not matching. Identification 3.

Respondent 15: ""III - Sepsis"". Not the target session. Identification 3.

Respondent 6: SessionName is ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"". Hmm, the session name here is slightly different. The task specifies ""II (Anaphylaxis)"", so even though it's similar, the exact name matters. So this one doesn't match. Identification is 3 here.

Respondent 12: SessionName is ""II (Anaphylaxis)"". That's a perfect match. Now check the Identification score. Their Identification is 3. So even though the session is correct, the score isn't 0. So this respondent doesn't qualify.

Respondent 18: SessionName ""IV - VT"". Not matching. Identification 3.

Respondent 3: SessionName is ""III-Sepsis"". Not the right session. Identification is 0 here, but the session is different. So even though Identification is 0, the session doesn't match. So exclude.

Respondent 17: SessionName ""V (Hypoglycemia)"". Not relevant. Identification 3.

So after checking all respondents, none of them are in the 'II (Anaphylaxis)' session with an Identification score of 0. The only respondent with Identification 0 is Respondent 3, but their session is III-Sepsis. Therefore, the answer should be an empty list.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents from the 'III-Sepsis' session whose 'Background (examination)' is exactly 2.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The goal is to list all respondents from the 'III-Sepsis' session who have a 'Background (examination)' score of exactly 2. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The data provided includes multiple respondents, each with various fields like SessionName, Background (examination), and others. The key here is to filter the respondents based on two criteria: their SessionName must be 'III-Sepsis' and their Background (examination) score must be exactly 2.

Looking at the 'Questions' section, the 'Background (examination)' field uses a rubric where 0 is the lowest and 3 is the highest. The task is looking for a score of 2, which according to the rubric means ""Observations reported with few further questions needed.""

Now, I'll go through each respondent in the 'Responses' section and check these two criteria.

Starting with Respondent 3:
- SessionName: III-Sepsis
- Background (examination): 3
This doesn't meet the score of 2, so skip.

Respondent 5:
- SessionName: II - Anaphylaxsis (different session)
- Not relevant.

Respondent 1:
- SessionName: V (Hypoglycemia)
- Not relevant.

Respondent 7:
- SessionName: III-Sepsis
- Background (examination): 3
Again, score is 3, so no.

Respondent 17:
- SessionName: V (Hypoglycemia)
- Not relevant.

Respondent 15:
- SessionName: III - Sepsis (note the space and capitalization)
- Background (examination): 3
Wait, the SessionName here is written as ""III - Sepsis"" with a space and hyphen. The task specifies 'III-Sepsis'. Are these considered the same? The original data might have variations in formatting. For example, in the data, Respondent 3 has ""III-Sepsis"", Respondent 15 has ""III - Sepsis"". The task uses 'III-Sepsis', so I need to check if these are the same. Since the task is case-sensitive and exact, but sometimes hyphens and spaces can vary. However, in the data, ""III-Sepsis"" and ""III - Sepsis"" might be considered different. But maybe the user intended them to be the same. Wait, looking at the example given in the problem, the user had a session named '(MI)-VT' but in the data, there's a session named 'MI' for Respondent 2. So perhaps the exact match is required. Therefore, 'III - Sepsis' (with space and hyphen) is different from 'III-Sepsis' (no space). Therefore, Respondent 15's session is ""III - Sepsis"", which doesn't exactly match ""III-Sepsis"". So they should be excluded.

Respondent 12:
- SessionName: II (Anaphylaxis)
- Not relevant.

Respondent 2:
- SessionName: MI
- Not relevant.

Wait, are there any other respondents with SessionName 'III-Sepsis'? Let me check again.

Looking through all respondents:

- Respondent 3: III-Sepsis
- Respondent 7: III-Sepsis
- Respondent 15: III - Sepsis (different formatting)
- Others have different SessionNames.

Now, among these, only Respondent 3 and 7 have SessionName 'III-Sepsis' (exact match). But their Background (examination) scores are 3 and 3, respectively. So neither of them have a score of 2. Wait, but the task is to find those with Background (examination) exactly 2. So in the 'III-Sepsis' session, are there any respondents with that score?

Looking again:

Respondent 3: Background (examination) 3
Respondent 7: Background (examination) 3
Respondent 15: SessionName is ""III - Sepsis"" (different) and score 3.

Wait, maybe I missed someone. Let me check all respondents again.

Looking at Respondent 15 again: SessionName is ""III - Sepsis"" (with spaces around the hyphen), which is different from ""III-Sepsis"". So according to exact match, they are different. Therefore, in the 'III-Sepsis' session, the only respondents are 3 and 7, both with Background (examination) 3. Therefore, there are no respondents in the 'III-Sepsis' session with a Background (examination) score of exactly 2.

But wait, let me check again. Maybe I missed a respondent. Let's list all respondents:

Respondent 3: III-Sepsis, exam 3
Respondent 5: II - Anaphylaxsis
Respondent 1: V (Hypoglycemia)
Respondent 7: III-Sepsis, exam 3
Respondent 17: V (Hypoglycemia)
Respondent 15: III - Sepsis, exam 3
Respondent 12: II (Anaphylaxis)
Respondent 2: MI

No one else. So the answer is that there are no respondents meeting the criteria. But wait, the task says ""list all respondents"", so if none, the answer is an empty list. But maybe I made a mistake in the SessionName matching. Let me check the exact SessionName in the data.

The task is looking for 'III-Sepsis'. In the data:

- Respondent 3: SessionName: III-Sepsis
- Respondent 7: SessionName: III-Sepsis
- Respondent 15: SessionName: III - Sepsis (with spaces)

So the exact matches are only 3 and 7. Both have exam scores of 3. Therefore, no respondents in 'III-Sepsis' have a Background (examination) of 2. So the answer should be an empty list.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'Assessment' score is between 0 and 1.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task. I need to find all respondents whose 'Assessment' score is between 0 and 1. First, I should check the schema to understand what the 'Assessment' rubric is.

Looking at the questions section, the 'Assessment' has a rubric where 0 means no logical assessment, 1 is assessment only after extended questioning, 2 is after minimal questioning, and 3 is comprehensive without questioning. The task is to find scores between 0 and 1, which would include 0 and 1. So any respondent with an Assessment score of 0 or 1 should be listed.

Now, I'll go through each respondent's data and check their 'Assessment' score. Let's start:

- Respondent 22: Assessment is 2. Not in range.
- Respondent 16: Assessment 3. No.
- Respondent 1: Assessment 3. No.
- Respondent 21: Assessment 2. No.
- Respondent 18: Assessment 3. No.
- Respondent 19: Assessment 2. No.
- Respondent 14: Assessment 3. No.
- Respondent 20: Assessment 3. No.
- Respondent 23: Assessment 3. No.
- Respondent 9: Assessment 2. No.
- Respondent 12: Assessment 2. No.
- Respondent 5: Assessment 3. No.

Wait, none of the respondents have an Assessment score of 0 or 1. Let me double-check each one again to make sure I didn't miss any. All Assessments are 2 or 3. So there are no respondents with a score between 0 and 1. The answer should be an empty list.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'Assessment' score is between 0 and 1.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task. The user wants me to find all respondents whose 'Assessment' score is between 0 and 1. First, I need to make sure I understand the data structure.

Looking at the questions section, the 'Assessment' field has a rubric with scores from 0 to 3. The rubric says:
- 0 = No logical assessment
- 1 = Assessment only after extended questioning
- 2 = Assessment after minimal questioning
- 3 = Comprehensive logical assessment without questioning

The task is to find respondents where the 'Assessment' score is between 0 and 1. That means scores of 0 or 1. But I need to check if the range is inclusive. The wording says ""between 0 and 1,"" which in some contexts might mean 0 < score < 1, but since these are integers, it's likely inclusive. So scores 0 and 1.

Now, I'll go through each respondent's 'Assessment' score in the responses.

Respondent 20: Assessment is 3 → No
Respondent 17: Assessment 3 → No
Respondent 9: Assessment 2 → No
Respondent 12: Assessment 2 → No
Respondent 21: Assessment 2 → No
Respondent 13: Assessment 2 → No
Respondent 3: Assessment 3 → No
Respondent 23: Assessment 3 → No

Wait, none of the respondents have an Assessment score of 0 or 1. Let me double-check each one again to be sure.

Looking again:

- Respondent 3: Assessment is 3. Others are 2 or 3. No one has 0 or 1. So the answer should be that there are no respondents meeting the criteria. The output would be an empty list. But the user might expect a list of respondent IDs. Since none qualify, the answer is an empty list.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents from the 'MI' session whose 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is exactly 0.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to list all respondents from the 'MI' session who have a 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' score of exactly 0. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The 'SessionName' field in the responses indicates the session each respondent attended. The 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is a rubric-based score where 0 means ""Not at all confident.""

Looking through each respondent's data:

- **Respondent 15**: SessionName is ""III - Sepsis"" and GRS is 2. Not MI, so skip.
- **Respondent 19**: SessionName ""I - MI"", GRS 3. MI session but score is 3, not 0.
- **Respondent 8**: Session ""III (Sepsis)"", GRS 3. Not MI.
- **Respondent 21**: Session ""I (Myocardial infarction)"", GRS 3. MI-related but session name isn't exactly 'MI', so maybe not. Need to check if 'Myocardial infarction' is considered part of 'MI' session. But the task specifies 'MI' session, so probably exact match required.
- **Respondent 10**: SessionName ""(MI)-VT"", GRS 2. The session includes MI but is named (MI)-VT. The original task says 'MI' session, but the example given in the user's data was '(MI)-VT' as a session name. Wait, the user's example in the first part had a task to list respondents from '(MI)-VT' session with GRS 0. But the current task is for 'MI' session. So need to check if the session name is exactly 'MI' or variations. 

Wait, the current task is different from the example. The example asked for '(MI)-VT' session, but now the task is 'MI' session. So I need to look for SessionName exactly 'MI' or any variation? Let's check the data.

Looking at the responses:

- **Respondent 2**: SessionName is ""MI"". GRS is 1. So this is an exact match for 'MI' session. But GRS is 1, not 0.
- **Respondent 19**: SessionName ""I - MI"" – not exact 'MI'.
- **Respondent 21**: ""I (Myocardial infarction)"" – MI is the abbreviation, but session name is written out.
- **Respondent 10**: ""(MI)-VT"" – includes MI but as part of the name.

So the only exact match for SessionName 'MI' is Respondent 2. However, their GRS is 1. 

Are there any other respondents with SessionName exactly 'MI'? Let's check all:

- Respondent 2: SessionName ""MI"" – GRS 1.
- Any others? Let's check all:

Looking through each:

- Respondent 15: III - Sepsis
- Respondent 19: I - MI
- Respondent 8: III (Sepsis)
- Respondent 21: I (Myocardial infarction)
- Respondent 10: (MI)-VT
- Respondent 3: III-Sepsis
- Respondent 2: MI
- Respondent 18: IV - VT
- Respondent 7: III-Sepsis
- Respondent 23: II-Anaphylaxsis
- Respondent 14: IV-Hypoglycemia

Only Respondent 2 has SessionName exactly ""MI"". Their GRS is 1. 

So, there are no respondents in the 'MI' session (exact name) with GRS 0. 

Wait, but maybe the task considers variations like ""I - MI"" or ""Myocardial infarction"" as part of the MI session? The example in the user's data had a session named '(MI)-VT', and the task was to list those. But the current task is for 'MI' session. The user might be using 'MI' as a broader category, but according to the data, SessionName is an open-ended field, so exact match is required unless specified otherwise. 

Therefore, the answer is that there are no respondents in the 'MI' session with GRS 0. So the list is empty.
</think>

Answer: 

No respondents from the 'MI' session have a 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' of exactly 0.",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents from the 'V (Hypoglycemia)' session whose 'Background (examination)' is exactly 1.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The question is asking to list all respondents from the 'V (Hypoglycemia)' session who have a 'Background (examination)' score of exactly 1. 

First, I need to look through the provided data to identify which respondents are part of the 'V (Hypoglycemia)' session. Let me go through each respondent one by one.

Starting with Respondent 2: Their SessionName is ""MI"", so that's not the one. Respondent 3 is in ""III-Sepsis"". Respondent 9 is in ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"". Respondent 18 is in ""IV - VT"". Respondent 19 is ""I - MI"". Respondent 23 is ""II-Anaphylaxsis"". Respondent 6 is ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"". Respondent 11 is ""IV (AF)"". Respondent 1 is ""V (Hypoglycemia)"". 

So, only Respondent 1 is in the 'V (Hypoglycemia)' session. Now, check their 'Background (examination)' score. For Respondent 1, the Background (examination) is 2. The question asks for exactly 1. Since 2 doesn't equal 1, there are no respondents in the 'V (Hypoglycemia)' session with a Background (examination) of 1. 

Wait, let me double-check. Maybe I missed someone. Let me go through all respondents again. No, the only one in 'V (Hypoglycemia)' is Respondent 1, and their score is 2. So the answer should be that there are no such respondents. The list is empty.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
List all respondents from the 'I (Myocardial infarction)' session whose 'Background (examination)' is exactly 3.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to list all respondents from the 'I (Myocardial infarction)' session whose 'Background (examination)' is exactly 3. 

First, I need to understand the data structure provided. The dataset includes several respondents, each with various fields like SessionName, Background (examination), etc. The key here is to filter the respondents based on two criteria: their SessionName and their Background (examination) score.

Looking at the 'Questions' section, the 'SessionName' is an open-ended question, so the exact wording in the responses matters. The 'Background (examination)' uses a rubric where 3 means ""Comprehensive focused examination/observations.""

Now, I'll go through each respondent in the 'Responses' section and check these two criteria.

Starting with Respondent 21:
- SessionName: ""I (Myocardial infarction)""
- Background (examination): 1
This doesn't meet the score requirement of 3, so they're out.

Respondent 9:
- SessionName: ""II (Anaphylaxsis)""
Not the correct session, so skip.

Respondent 15:
- SessionName: ""III - Sepsis""
Nope, different session.

Respondent 16:
- SessionName: ""I - MI""
Hmm, the session name here is ""I - MI"". The task specifies 'I (Myocardial infarction)'. Are these considered the same? Since MI stands for Myocardial Infarction, and the session names might be abbreviated differently, but the problem uses the exact name ""I (Myocardial infarction)"", I need to check if ""I - MI"" is considered the same. However, the problem is looking for an exact match on the SessionName. The SessionName for Respondent 16 is ""I - MI"", which is different from ""I (Myocardial infarction)"". So this might not be a match. But wait, maybe there's a typo or variation. Let me check the data again. In the example given in the data, Respondent 21 has SessionName ""I (Myocardial infarction)"", while Respondent 16 has ""I - MI"". The task is looking for the exact SessionName as per the data. So unless ""I - MI"" is considered the same as ""I (Myocardial infarction)"", which isn't explicitly stated, we have to treat them as different. Therefore, Respondent 16's SessionName doesn't match exactly. However, sometimes in data entry, variations might be considered the same, but according to the problem's instructions, we need to be precise. So Respondent 16 might not be included. But let's check their Background (examination) score anyway. It's 3. If the SessionName is considered a match, they would be included. But according to exact string matching, ""I (Myocardial infarction)"" vs. ""I - MI"" are different. So perhaps Respondent 16 is not included. 

Wait, looking back at the example in the initial data, the user had a task to find respondents from '(MI)-VT' session, but in the data, the SessionNames are like ""I (Myocardial infarction)"" and ""I - MI"". The example answer was empty, meaning no respondents matched. So perhaps in this case, the exact SessionName is crucial. Therefore, for the current task, only respondents with SessionName exactly ""I (Myocardial infarction)"" should be considered. 

So Respondent 21 has SessionName ""I (Myocardial infarction)"", but their Background (examination) is 1. So they don't meet the score. 

Respondent 8:
- SessionName: ""III (Sepsis)""
Not the correct session.

So, after checking all respondents, none have both the exact SessionName ""I (Myocardial infarction)"" and a Background (examination) score of 3. Wait, but Respondent 16 has SessionName ""I - MI"" and Background (examination) 3. If ""I - MI"" is considered an acceptable variation of ""I (Myocardial infarction)"", then they would be included. But the problem states to use the exact SessionName as provided. Since the task specifies 'I (Myocardial infarction)', and Respondent 16's SessionName is 'I - MI', they are different. Therefore, there are no respondents that meet both criteria. 

But wait, maybe I should check if there's any other respondent. Let me go through each one again:

Respondent 21: SessionName ""I (Myocardial infarction)"", Background (examination) 1 → no.
Respondent 9: Different session.
Respondent 15: Different session.
Respondent 16: SessionName ""I - MI"", Background (examination) 3 → SessionName doesn't match exactly.
Respondent 8: Different session.

So the answer is that there are no respondents meeting both criteria. But wait, maybe ""I - MI"" is an abbreviation and should be considered the same as ""I (Myocardial infarction)"". However, according to the data provided, the SessionName is an open-ended field, so exact match is required unless specified otherwise. The problem doesn't mention considering variations, so we must stick to exact matches. Therefore, the answer is that there are no respondents in the 'I (Myocardial infarction)' session with Background (examination) 3. 

But wait, looking back at the data, Respondent 16's SessionName is ""I - MI"". The task is to find ""I (Myocardial infarction)"". Since MI stands for Myocardial Infarction, perhaps ""I - MI"" is equivalent. But the problem says to use the exact SessionName as per the data. The example in the initial data had a session named ""(MI)-VT"", but in the responses, the SessionNames are different. The example answer was empty, implying that exact matches are required. Therefore, in this case, ""I (Myocardial infarction)"" and ""I - MI"" are different, so Respondent 16 is excluded. Hence, no respondents meet the criteria. 

But wait, let me check the data again. The task is to list respondents from the 'I (Myocardial infarction)' session. In the data, Respondent 21's SessionName is ""I (Myocardial infarction)"", and Respondent 16's is ""I - MI"". Are these two different sessions? It's possible that ""I (Myocardial infarction)"" and ""I - MI"" are two different sessions, perhaps different instances or different naming conventions. Since the problem requires exact match, we can't assume they are the same. Therefore, the only respondent in the 'I (Myocardial infarction)' session is Respondent 21, but their Background (examination) is 1, not 3. Therefore, the answer is that there are no respondents meeting both criteria. 

But wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again. The task is to find respondents in SessionName 'I (Myocardial infarction)' with Background (examination) exactly 3. The only respondent in that session is 21, but their Background (examination) is 1. So the answer is none. But the user might have intended that ""I - MI"" is the same as ""I (Myocardial infarction)"", but according to the data, they are different. So the correct answer is that there are no respondents meeting the criteria. Therefore, the final answer is an empty list.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents from the 'II - Anaphylaxsis' session whose 'Background (examination)' is exactly 1.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The user wants a list of respondents from the 'II - Anaphylaxsis' session with a 'Background (examination)' score of exactly 1. 

First, I need to look through all the responses provided. Let me start by checking each respondent's SessionName. The target session is 'II - Anaphylaxsis'. Wait, looking at the data, there are two similar session names: Respondent 9 has 'II (Anaphylaxsis)' and Respondent 5 has 'II - Anaphylaxsis'. The task specifies 'II - Anaphylaxsis', so I should focus on that exact name.

Now, check each respondent in that session. Respondent 5's SessionName is 'II - Anaphylaxsis'. Their Background (examination) is 3. That's not 1, so they don't qualify. 

Are there any other respondents in the same session? Let me check the others. Respondent 9's SessionName is 'II (Anaphylaxsis)', which is slightly different. The task specifies the exact name with hyphens and spacing, so Respondent 9's session might not be considered a match. 

Looking at other respondents, none have the exact 'II - Anaphylaxsis' session name. Now, check the Background (examination) scores. The only respondent in the target session (Respondent 5) has a score of 3. Therefore, there are no respondents in the 'II - Anaphylaxsis' session with a Background (examination) of exactly 1. 

Wait, maybe I should double-check if there are any typos or alternative spellings. The data shows 'Anaphylaxsis' with two 's's, which might be a typo for 'Anaphylaxis', but the task uses the same spelling, so I have to stick with that. Also, the session names for Respondents 9 and 5 differ in punctuation (parentheses vs. hyphens), so they are considered different sessions. 

Therefore, the answer is that there are no respondents meeting the criteria. The final list is empty.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
List all respondents from the 'MI' session whose 'Background (history)' is exactly 0.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The user wants a list of respondents from the 'MI' session with a 'Background (history)' score of exactly 0. 

First, I need to understand what the 'MI' session refers to. Looking at the SessionName field in the responses, I should check each respondent's SessionName to see if it matches 'MI'. The task specifies 'MI' session, so I need to be precise. For example, there's a respondent with SessionName ""I (Myocardial infarction)"", but that's a different session name. The exact match is important here.

Next, I need to check the 'Background (history)' score for each of those respondents. The question defines the rubric for Background (history) as 0 to 3. The task asks for exactly 0, so I need to find respondents in the 'MI' session who have a 0 in that category.

Looking through the responses:

- Respondent 2 has SessionName ""MI"" and Background (history) score of 2. So that's not a match.
- Respondent 10's SessionName is ""(MI)-VT"", which might be a variation, but the task specifies 'MI' exactly. So this might not count unless the user considers partial matches, but according to the instructions, it's exact. So ""(MI)-VT"" is different from ""MI"".
- Other respondents with MI-related names like ""I (Myocardial infarction)"" are separate sessions. 

Checking all other respondents, none have SessionName exactly as 'MI' except Respondent 2, but their Background (history) is 2. Therefore, there are no respondents in the 'MI' session with a Background (history) score of 0.

<task>
Which respondents from sessions on '2025-05-04' have a 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' of 1 and a 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' of less than 2?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The task is to find which respondents from the sessions on 2025-05-04 have a 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' of 1 and a 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' of less than 2. 

First, I need to look at the data provided. Let's go through each respondent who has the date 2025-05-04.

Looking at the responses:

- Respondent 15: Date is 2025-05-04. Their 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' is 2, and 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is 2. So, clear recommendation is 2 (needs to be 1) and GRS is 2 (needs to be less than 2). Doesn't meet the criteria.

- Respondent 18: Date is 2025-05-04. 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' is 2, GRS is 2. Again, same as above. Doesn't fit.

- Respondent 17: Date is 2025-05-04. 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' is 3, GRS is 2. Both values are higher than required. Not a match.

Wait, are there any other respondents with the date 2025-05-04? Let me check again. The other respondents are 6 (April 4), 14 (March 14), 20 (May 2), and then 15, 18, 17 on May 4. 

So, among the May 4th respondents, none have a 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' of 1. The possible values for that field in the data are 1, 2, 3. The only one with a 1 is Respondent 14, but their date is March 14, not May 4. 

Therefore, there are no respondents who meet both criteria on 2025-05-04. The answer should be an empty list.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondents from sessions on '2025-03-14' have a 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' of 3 and a 'Identification' of less than 2?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The question is asking which respondents from the sessions on '2025-03-14' have a 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' of 3 and an 'Identification' score of less than 2. 

First, I need to look through all the respondents and filter them based on the date. The date given is March 14, 2025. Let me check each respondent's date.

Looking at the responses:

- Respondent 13 has a date of 2025-03-14.
- Respondent 7 also has a date of 2025-03-14.

Now, I need to check these two respondents for the other criteria. 

Starting with Respondent 13:
- 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is 2.
- 'Identification' is 3. 

Since the global rating scale needs to be 3 and Identification less than 2, this respondent doesn't meet the criteria.

Next, Respondent 7:
- 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is 2.
- 'Identification' is 3. 

Again, both values don't meet the required conditions. 

Wait, are there any other respondents with the date 2025-03-14? Let me double-check. The other respondents have dates in April and May 2025. So only Respondents 13 and 7 are from March 14th. Neither of them have a global rating scale of 3, and their Identification scores are both 3, which is not less than 2. 

Therefore, there are no respondents from March 14, 2025, who meet both conditions. The answer should be that there are no such respondents.

Answer: None",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondents from sessions on '2025-05-04' have a 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' of 2 and a 'Situation' of less than 2?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The question is asking which respondents from sessions on '2025-05-04' have a 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' of 2 and a 'Situation' score of less than 2. 

First, I need to look at the data provided. Let's start by filtering the responses to only those with the date '2025-05-04'. Looking through the respondents:

- Respondent 9: Date is 2025-05-04.
- Respondent 15: Date is 2025-05-04.

The other respondents (12, 8, 16, 7) have different dates, so they can be excluded.

Next, check the 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' for these two. The question requires this value to be exactly 2. 

- Respondent 9: 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' is 3. So this doesn't meet the criteria.
- Respondent 15: 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' is 2. This meets the criteria.

Now, check the 'Situation' score for these respondents. The requirement is a score less than 2. 

- Respondent 9: 'Situation' is 3, which is not less than 2.
- Respondent 15: 'Situation' is 3, also not less than 2.

Wait, both of them have 'Situation' scores of 3. That means neither of them meet the 'Situation' < 2 condition. So there are no respondents that satisfy both conditions. 

But let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss any other respondents. The other respondents on 2025-05-04 are only 9 and 15. Both have 'Situation' scores of 3. Therefore, the answer should be that there are no respondents meeting both criteria.

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondents from sessions on '2025-05-16' have a 'Background (history)' of 3 and a 'Background (examination)' of less than 2?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The question is asking which respondents from sessions on '2025-05-16' have a 'Background (history)' of 3 and a 'Background (examination)' of less than 2. 

First, I need to go through each respondent in the data and check if they meet these three criteria: their session date is 2025-05-16, their Background (history) score is exactly 3, and their Background (examination) score is less than 2.

Looking at the responses, let's start with Respondent 5. Their date is 2025-05-04, so that's not the right date. Next is Respondent 10, date 2025-03-14. Respondent 1's date is 2025-05-02. Respondent 13 is 2025-03-14. Respondent 11 is 2025-04-04. Respondent 20 is 2025-05-02. Then Respondent 19: their date is 2025-05-16. That's the date we're looking for. Now check their Background (history) and examination. Background (history) is 3, and examination is 3. Wait, the examination is 3, which is not less than 2. So Respondent 19 doesn't meet the criteria. 

Next is Respondent 15, date 2025-05-04. So the only respondent with the date 2025-05-16 is Respondent 19, but their Background (examination) is 3, which is not less than 2. Are there any other respondents with that date? Let me check again. The list includes Respondent 5, 10, 1, 13, 11, 20, 19, 15. Only Respondent 19 has the date 2025-05-16. So even though their Background (history) is 3, the examination is 3, which doesn't meet the second condition. 

Therefore, there are no respondents who meet all three criteria. The answer should be an empty list.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents whose 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is within 1 point of the lowest 'Assessment' for their session name.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

Which respondents have a total score across all rubric items that is higher than the average total score for all respondents?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find which respondents have a total score across all rubric items that's higher than the average total score for all respondents. 

First, I need to identify which fields in the responses are rubric items. Looking at the questions section, the rubric items are: Identification, Situation, Background (history), Background (examination), Assessment, Recommendation (clear recommendation), and Recommendation (global rating scale). Wait, the last one is also a rubric, right? The GRS is part of the rubric with scores 0-3. So all these seven fields are rubric items.

Next, I need to calculate the total score for each respondent by summing these seven values. Let's go through each respondent one by one.

Starting with Respondent 17:
- Identification: 3
- Situation: 3
- Background (history): 3
- Background (examination): 3
- Assessment: 3
- Recommendation (clear recommendation): 3
- GRS: 2
Total = 3+3+3+3+3+3+2 = 20

Respondent 6:
3 + 2 +3 +3 +2 +2 +3 = 3+2=5, +3=8, +3=11, +2=13, +2=15, +3=18. Total 18.

Respondent 18:
3 +3 +2 +2 +3 +2 +2. Let's add: 3+3=6, +2=8, +2=10, +3=13, +2=15, +2=17. Total 17.

Respondent 22:
3 +3 +3 +3 +2 +2 +3. 3+3=6, +3=9, +3=12, +2=14, +2=16, +3=19. Total 19.

Respondent 11:
3+3+3+3+3+3+3=21.

Respondent 21:
3 +2 +3 +1 +2 +3 +3. 3+2=5, +3=8, +1=9, +2=11, +3=14, +3=17. Total 17.

Respondent 14:
3+3+2+2+3+1+2. 3+3=6, +2=8, +2=10, +3=13, +1=14, +2=16. Total 16.

Respondent 15:
3+3+2+3+2+2+2. 3+3=6, +2=8, +3=11, +2=13, +2=15, +2=17. Total 17.

Respondent 4:
3+3+3+2+2+2+2. 3+3=6, +3=9, +2=11, +2=13, +2=15, +2=17. Total 17.

Now, let's list all the totals:
- 17: 20
- 6: 18
- 18:17
- 22:19
- 11:21
- 21:17
- 14:16
- 15:17
- 4:17

Now, calculate the average total score. Sum all these totals and divide by the number of respondents (9).

Sum = 20 +18 +17 +19 +21 +17 +16 +17 +17. Let's add:

20+18=38, +17=55, +19=74, +21=95, +17=112, +16=128, +17=145, +17=162.

Average = 162 /9 = 18.

So the average total score is 18.

Now, find which respondents have a total higher than 18. Looking at the totals:

Respondent 17: 20 >18 → yes
Respondent 6: 18 → equal, so no
Respondent 22:19 >18 → yes
Respondent 11:21 >18 → yes

Others are 17 or below. So the respondents with total higher than average (18) are 17, 22, 11.

Wait, let me check the totals again. Respondent 22's total is 19, which is above 18. Respondent 11 has 21. Respondent 17 has 20. So those three. The others are 18 or below. So the answer should be Respondents 17, 22, and 11.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'Background (examination)' is greater than the average 'Background (examination)' for their session name.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find all respondents whose 'Background (examination)' score is greater than the average for their respective session names. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The data has multiple respondents, each with a 'SessionName' and a 'Background (examination)' score. The 'Background (examination)' is a rubric-based score from 0 to 3. 

The plan is to:
1. Calculate the average 'Background (examination)' score for each session.
2. Compare each respondent's score in that session to the session's average.
3. Identify respondents where their score exceeds the session's average.

Let me start by listing all the sessions and their corresponding respondents. 

Looking at the data:

- **Respondent 23**: SessionName ""II-Anaphylaxsis"", Background (examination) = 2
- **Respondent 7**: SessionName ""III-Sepsis"", Background (examination) = 3
- **Respondent 22**: SessionName ""IV (VT)"", Background (examination) = 3
- **Respondent 9**: SessionName ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"", Background (examination) = 2
- **Respondent 3**: SessionName ""III-Sepsis"", Background (examination) = 3
- **Respondent 4**: SessionName ""III (Sepsis)"", Background (examination) = 2
- **Respondent 6**: SessionName ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"", Background (examination) = 3
- **Respondent 12**: SessionName ""II (Anaphylaxis)"", Background (examination) = 3

Now, group respondents by SessionName. Note that some session names might be the same but written differently. For example, ""II-Anaphylaxsis"", ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"", ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"", and ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" could be considered the same session or different. Similarly, ""III-Sepsis"" and ""III (Sepsis)"" might be the same. But the exact session names as written in the data must be considered unless specified otherwise. However, the problem statement doesn't mention normalizing session names, so I should treat them as distinct if their names differ.

Wait, but looking at the task, it says ""their session name"", so each unique SessionName as per the data. Let's list each unique SessionName and calculate their averages.

Unique SessionNames from the data:
1. II-Anaphylaxsis
2. III-Sepsis
3. IV (VT)
4. II (Anaphylaxsis)
5. III (Sepsis)
6. II (Anaphylactic Shock)
7. II (Anaphylaxis)

Now, for each of these sessions, compute the average Background (examination) score.

Let's go through each session:

1. **II-Anaphylaxsis**:
   - Respondent 23: 2
   - Only one respondent here. Average = 2.

2. **III-Sepsis**:
   - Respondent 7: 3
   - Respondent 3: 3
   - Total = 6, count = 2. Average = 3.

3. **IV (VT)**:
   - Respondent 22: 3
   - Only one. Average = 3.

4. **II (Anaphylaxsis)**:
   - Respondent 9: 2
   - Average = 2.

5. **III (Sepsis)**:
   - Respondent 4: 2
   - Only one. Average = 2.

6. **II (Anaphylactic Shock)**:
   - Respondent 6: 3
   - Average = 3.

7. **II (Anaphylaxis)**:
   - Respondent 12: 3
   - Average = 3.

Now, compare each respondent's score to their session's average.

- **Respondent 23**: Session II-Anaphylaxsis, score 2 vs avg 2 → not greater.
- **Respondent 7**: III-Sepsis, 3 vs avg 3 → not greater.
- **Respondent 22**: IV (VT), 3 vs avg 3 → not greater.
- **Respondent 9**: II (Anaphylaxsis), 2 vs avg 2 → no.
- **Respondent 3**: III-Sepsis, 3 vs avg 3 → no.
- **Respondent 4**: III (Sepsis), 2 vs avg 2 → no.
- **Respondent 6**: II (Anaphylactic Shock), 3 vs avg 3 → no.
- **Respondent 12**: II (Anaphylaxis), 3 vs avg 3 → no.

Wait, none of the respondents have a score higher than the session's average. All are equal. The task says ""greater than the average"". So, in this case, there are no respondents where their score is above the average. Therefore, the answer should be an empty list.

But wait, let me double-check the calculations. For example, in session III-Sepsis, average is 3 (since both respondents scored 3). So their scores are equal. Similarly, in II (Anaphylactic Shock) and II (Anaphylaxis), the average is 3, and the respondent's score is 3. So no one is above. 

Therefore, the answer is that there are no respondents meeting the criteria.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents whose 'Background (history)' is within 1 point of the lowest 'Identification' for their session name.
