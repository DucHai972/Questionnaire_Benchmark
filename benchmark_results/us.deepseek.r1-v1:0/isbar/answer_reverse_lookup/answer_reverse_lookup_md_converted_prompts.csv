<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents from sessions on '2025-05-02' who scored 3 on 'Background (examination)'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The goal is to list all respondents from sessions on '2025-05-02' who scored 3 on 'Background (examination)'. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The dataset has a 'questions' section that defines each field and their possible scores. The 'responses' section contains individual respondents with their scores for each category.

The task has two main criteria: the date must be '2025-05-02' and the 'Background (examination)' score must be 3. 

I'll start by going through each respondent in the responses and check their 'Date' field. If the date matches '2025-05-02', I'll then check their score for 'Background (examination)'. If that score is 3, I'll note their respondent number.

Looking at the respondents:

- **Respondent 8**: Date is 2025-05-02. Background (examination) is 2. Doesn't meet the score requirement.
- **Respondent 1**: Date is 2025-05-02. Background (examination) is 2. Not a match.
- **Respondent 20**: Date is 2025-05-02. Background (examination) is -1. Also not a match.
- **Respondent 2**: Date is 2025-04-04. Not the right date.
- **Respondent 5**: Date is 2025-05-04. Wrong date.
- **Respondent 7**: 2025-03-14. Nope.
- **Respondent 3**: 2025-04-04. No.
- **Respondent 4 and 22**: 2025-05-16. Not the date we need.
- **Respondent 10**: 2025-03-14. Doesn't apply.

Wait, I might have missed someone. Let me check again. All respondents with date 2025-05-02 are 8, 1, 20, and maybe others? Let me confirm:

Looking through each:

- Respondent 8: 2025-05-02, Background exam 2.
- Respondent 1: 2025-05-02, Background exam 2.
- Respondent 20: 2025-05-02, Background exam -1.
- Any others? Respondent 2 is 2025-04-04. Respondent 5 is 2025-05-04. The rest are other dates.

So none of the respondents on 2025-05-02 have a Background (examination) score of 3. Therefore, the answer should be that there are no such respondents. But wait, the example given in the problem had an answer of 15, which might be a typo or from different data. But according to the provided data, there are no respondents meeting both criteria. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check once more.

Wait, looking at Respondent 2: Date is 2025-04-04. Not the target date. Respondent 5 is 2025-05-04. So no one on 2025-05-02 has a Background (examination) of 3. Therefore, the answer is that there are no respondents, so the list is empty. But the output format requires a comma-separated list. If there are none, maybe the answer is ""None"" or just an empty string. However, the example answer was ""15"", which might be a placeholder. But according to the data provided, the correct answer is that there are no respondents meeting the criteria. So the final answer should be an empty list, but since the example used a number, maybe the answer is 0. Wait, the task says ""list all respondents"", so if none, the answer is an empty string. But the output rules say for a count, provide the number. Wait, the task says ""List all respondents"", which would be a list of IDs. If none, then the answer is an empty list. But how to represent that? The example answer was ""15"", which is a number, but in that case, maybe the answer is ""None"". However, according to the output rules, if it's a list, provide a comma-separated list. If there are none, perhaps the answer is just blank. But the system might expect a specific format. Let me check the output rules again.

The output rules state: If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list. So if there are no such respondents, the answer would be an empty string. But in the example, the answer was ""15"", which is a count. Wait, the example's task was to list respondents from a specific date with a score of 3 on Situation, and the answer was 15. But in the data provided, the correct answer was Respondent 5. Wait, looking back at the example data:

In the example, the correct answer was Respondent 5, who has Date 2025-05-04 and Situation 3. But the example answer was ""15"", which might be a typo. But in the current task, the date is 2025-05-02 and Background (examination) 3. Checking all respondents on that date, none have Background (examination) 3. So the answer is that there are no respondents, hence an empty list. But according to the output rules, if it's a list, provide a comma-separated list. So the answer should be an empty string. However, sometimes systems expect ""None"" or similar. But according to the output rules, strictly follow the format. So the answer is nothing, but since the system might require a response, perhaps the answer is ""None"". But the example had a numerical answer. Wait, the example's answer was ""15"", but in the data, Respondent 5 is the only one with Date 2025-05-04 and Situation 3. So maybe the example answer was incorrect. But in this case, the correct answer is that there are no respondents meeting the criteria. Therefore, the answer is an empty list, which would be represented as an empty string. But the output rules say for a list, provide a comma-separated list. So the answer is just empty. However, the user might expect ""None"" or ""No respondents"". But according to the output rules, it's a comma-separated list. So the answer is nothing. But maybe the correct answer is that there are no such respondents, so the list is empty. Therefore, the answer is an empty string. But the example had a number, which was likely a mistake. So in this case, the answer is that there are no respondents, so the output is blank. But how to represent that? Maybe just write ""None"". But according to the output rules, if it's a list, comma-separated. So if there are none, just leave it empty. But the system might not accept that. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in checking the respondents. Let me triple-check.

Looking at all respondents with Date 2025-05-02:

- Respondent 8: Date 2025-05-02, Background (examination) 2.
- Respondent 1: Date 2025-05-02, Background (examination) 2.
- Respondent 20: Date 2025-05-02, Background (examination) -1.

No one else. So none have a score of 3. Therefore, the answer is that there are no respondents, so the list is empty. Hence, the answer is an empty string. But the output rules say to provide a simple comma-separated list. So the answer is nothing. But maybe the correct answer is ""None"". However, according to the output instructions, if the question asks for a list, provide the list. If there are none, it's empty. So the answer is just empty. But in the example, the answer was ""15"", which was a number. But in this case, the answer is no respondents. So the final answer is an empty list, which would be represented as an empty string. But perhaps the system expects ""None"" or ""No respondents found"". However, the output rules state to follow the format strictly. Therefore, the answer is an empty string. But since the user might expect a response, perhaps the answer is ""None"". But I'll proceed with the data as per the instructions.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Find all respondents from the 'III (Sepsis)' session who scored 2 on 'Assessment' and 3 on 'Situation'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The goal is to find all respondents from the 'III (Sepsis)' session who scored 2 on 'Assessment' and 3 on 'Situation'. 

First, I need to go through each respondent in the data and check if they meet all three conditions: their SessionName is 'III (Sepsis)', their Assessment score is 2, and their Situation score is 3.

Looking at the responses:

Starting with Respondent 18: SessionName is IV - VT. Not III (Sepsis), so skip.

Respondent 11: Session IV (AF). Nope.

Respondent 12: Session II (Anaphylaxis). Not relevant.

Respondent 15: Session III - Sepsis. Hmm, the session name here is written as ""III - Sepsis"". The task specifies 'III (Sepsis)', but maybe variations in punctuation or spacing are considered the same. Let's note this and check the scores. Situation is 3, Assessment is 2. If the session name is considered a match, this could be a candidate. But need to confirm if ""III - Sepsis"" is equivalent to ""III (Sepsis)"".

Next, Respondent 9: Session II (Anaphylaxsis). No.

Respondent 10: Different date and session. Skip.

Respondent 19: Session I - MI. No.

Respondent 8: Session III (Sepsis). Here, the session name exactly matches. Their Situation is 3, Assessment is 2. So this is a match.

Respondent 2: Session MI. Not relevant.

Respondent 21: Session I (Myocardial infarction). No.

Respondent 4: Session III (Sepsis). Check scores: Situation 3, Assessment 2. So this is another match.

Now, back to Respondent 15: Their session is ""III - Sepsis"". The task specifies 'III (Sepsis)'. The difference is the separator between III and Sepsis: hyphen vs parentheses. But in the data, there's another respondent (Respondent 8) with ""III (Sepsis)"" and Respondent 4 also ""III (Sepsis)"". However, Respondent 15's session is ""III - Sepsis"". Are these considered the same session? The task is looking for 'III (Sepsis)', so maybe the exact name matters. But sometimes, sessions might have variations in naming. For example, in the data, there's ""III - Sepsis"" and ""III (Sepsis)"". Are these considered the same? The task uses 'III (Sepsis)', so perhaps only exact matches count. Therefore, Respondent 15's session name is ""III - Sepsis"" which is different from ""III (Sepsis)"", so they might not be included. 

Wait, but in the original example provided, the answer was 15. Let me check the example again. In the example, the task was to list respondents from 2025-05-04 with Situation 3. The answer was 15, which is Respondent 15. Looking at Respondent 15's data: Date is 2025-05-04, SessionName III - Sepsis, Situation 3. So in that example, the session name was written as ""III - Sepsis"" but the answer included it. So perhaps the session name variations (hyphen vs parentheses) are considered the same. Therefore, in the current task, ""III (Sepsis)"" and ""III - Sepsis"" might both be acceptable. 

But the current task specifically asks for 'III (Sepsis)'. However, in the data, Respondent 8 and 4 have ""III (Sepsis)"", while Respondent 15 has ""III - Sepsis"". So if the task is strict about the exact session name, then only 8 and 4. But if variations are allowed, then 15 might be included. But the example shows that even with a hyphen, it's considered. So maybe the session name is considered the same regardless of the separator. 

Wait, in the example, the correct answer was Respondent 15, whose SessionName is ""III - Sepsis"". The example's task was to find respondents from 2025-05-04 who scored 3 on Situation. So the session name wasn't part of the criteria there. So that example doesn't clarify whether session name variations are considered the same. 

In the current task, the session name is part of the criteria. The task says: 'III (Sepsis)'. So we need to check if the respondent's SessionName exactly matches that. 

Looking at the data:

- Respondent 8: SessionName is ""III (Sepsis)"" – exact match.
- Respondent 4: SessionName is ""III (Sepsis)"" – exact match.
- Respondent 15: SessionName is ""III - Sepsis"" – hyphen instead of parentheses. Not an exact match. 

Therefore, only Respondents 8 and 4 would be considered for the session name. However, checking their scores:

Respondent 8: Situation 3, Assessment 2. So meets the criteria. 

Respondent 4: Situation 3, Assessment 2. Also meets the criteria. 

Wait, but in the data, Respondent 8's Assessment is 2, Situation 3. So they are a match. Respondent 4: same. 

But what about Respondent 15? Their SessionName is ""III - Sepsis"", which is not exactly ""III (Sepsis)"", so they are excluded. 

Therefore, the answer should be Respondents 8 and 4. But let's check their IDs. 

Looking at the data:

Respondent 8: ID 8, SessionName III (Sepsis), Assessment 2, Situation 3.

Respondent 4: ID 4, SessionName III (Sepsis), Assessment 2, Situation 3.

So both of these meet all three conditions. 

Therefore, the answer is the IDs 8 and 4. But wait, the task says ""list all respondents"", so the answer should be their IDs. 

But the example in the problem had the answer as ""15"", which is the ID. So in this case, the answer should be the IDs of the respondents who meet the criteria. 

So the correct respondents are 8 and 4. Therefore, the answer is ""8, 4"".

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondents have a total score for 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' greater than 5?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find which respondents have a total score for 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' greater than 5. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The responses section lists each respondent with their scores for various questions. The two relevant fields here are ""Recommendation (global rating scale)"" and ""Recommendation (clear recommendation)"". 

For each respondent, I need to add these two scores and check if the sum is greater than 5. Let's go through each respondent one by one.

Starting with Respondent 21:
- Global Rating Scale: 3
- Clear Recommendation: 3
Sum: 3 + 3 = 6. 6 is greater than 5, so this respondent qualifies.

Respondent 22:
- Global: 3
- Clear: 2
Sum: 5. Not greater than 5. Exclude.

Respondent 2:
- Global: 1
- Clear: 2
Sum: 3. Exclude.

Respondent 5:
- Global: 3
- Clear: 2
Sum: 5. Exclude.

Respondent 20:
- Global: 3
- Clear: 2
Sum: 5. Exclude.

Respondent 10:
- Both are 2. Sum 4. Exclude.

Respondent 3:
- Global: 3
- Clear: 3
Sum: 6. Include.

Respondent 8:
- Global: 3
- Clear: 2
Sum: 5. Exclude.

Respondent 23:
- Global: 3
- Clear: 3
Sum: 6. Include.

Respondent 9:
- Global: 2
- Clear: 3
Sum: 5. Exclude.

Respondent 13:
- Both 2. Sum 4. Exclude.

Respondent 7:
- Both 2. Sum 4. Exclude.

So the respondents with sums greater than 5 are 21, 3, and 23. Wait, let me double-check:

Respondent 21: 3+3=6 ✅
Respondent 3: 3+3=6 ✅
Respondent 23: 3+3=6 ✅
Any others? Let me check again.

Looking back, Respondent 3's scores: Global is 3, Clear is 3. Yes. Respondent 23: same. Respondent 21: same. No others. So the answer should be 21, 3, 23. But wait, the answer in the example was 15. Wait, no, the example was a different question. The current task is different. So the correct respondents are 21, 3, 23. Wait, but let me check again.

Wait, in the data provided, Respondent 3's 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' is 3? Let me check:

Looking at Respondent 3's data:
- **Recommendation (clear recommendation):** 3
- **Recommendation (global rating scale):** 3
Sum: 6. Yes.

Respondent 23:
- **Recommendation (clear recommendation):** 3
- **Recommendation (global rating scale):** 3
Sum: 6.

Respondent 21:
- **Recommendation (clear recommendation):** 3
- **Recommendation (global rating scale):** 3
Sum: 6.

So those three. Are there any others? Let's check again:

Respondent 7: Clear 2, Global 2. Sum 4. No.
Respondent 8: Clear 2, Global 3. Sum 5. No.
Respondent 9: Clear 3, Global 2. Sum 5. No.
Respondent 22: Clear 2, Global 3. Sum 5. No.
Others are all below. So the answer is 21, 3, 23. But wait, the respondent numbers are 21, 22, 2,5,20,10,3,8,23,9,13,7. So 21,3,23 are the ones. But the output should be a comma-separated list of their IDs. So the answer is ""21, 3, 23"".

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents who scored 3 on 'Identification' and whose 'Comments' contain the word 'Overall'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The user wants a list of respondents who scored 3 on 'Identification' and whose 'Comments' include the word 'Overall'. 

First, I need to go through each respondent in the data. Let's start with Respondent 20. Their Identification is 3, which meets the first condition. Now, check the Comments: ""Good"". No mention of ""Overall"" here, so they're out.

Next, Respondent 23. Identification is 3. Comments mention ""Time: (11:43-11:58)...DID: Sepsis I Anaphylaxsis..."" No ""Overall"" here either.

Respondent 8: Identification 3. Comments say ""Clear communication during handover Good"". Still no ""Overall"".

Respondent 17: Identification 3. Comments are ""Concise - clear Satisfactory"". Not matching.

Respondent 13: Identification 3. Comments talk about time, Ventricular fibrillation, and communication issues. No ""Overall"".

Respondent 15: Identification 3. Comments: ""Detailed Response - clear communication"". No ""Overall"".

Respondent 18: Identification 3. Comments mention ""Not very concise or clear communication Satisfactory"". Still no.

Respondent 10: Identification is 2, so they don't meet the first condition. Skip.

Respondent 14: Identification 3. Comments: ""Time: (2:36-2:53) Late response..."" No ""Overall"".

Respondent 16: Identification 3. Comments: ""Consent denied for video recordings Satisfactory"". Doesn't have ""Overall"".

Respondent 7: Identification 3. Comments: ""Time: (1:00-1:17)"". No.

Respondent 5: Identification 3. Comments: ""Good clear and precise clinical handover Good"". Still no ""Overall"".

Wait, none of the respondents have ""Overall"" in their comments. Let me double-check each comment section again to be sure. Scanning through all comments, the word ""Overall"" isn't present in any of them. 

So, even though some respondents scored 3 on Identification, none have ""Overall"" in their comments. Therefore, the answer should be that there are no such respondents.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents who scored 1 on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and whose 'Comments' contain the word 'Clear'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The goal is to list all respondents who scored 1 on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and whose 'Comments' contain the word 'Clear'. 

First, I need to understand the structure of the data provided. The dataset includes multiple respondents, each with various scores and comments. The key fields here are 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 'Comments'. 

Starting with the 'Recommendation (global rating scale)'. According to the questions section, the rubric for this is:
- 0 = Not at all confident
- 1 = Confident but required extended questioning
- 2 = Confident but required some further questioning
- 3 = Confident and required little or no questioning

So, we're looking for respondents who have a score of 1 here. That means they are confident but needed extended questioning.

Next, the 'Comments' field needs to contain the word 'Clear'. The search is case-insensitive, so both 'Clear' and 'clear' should be considered. However, the output should preserve the original capitalization as per the comments.

Now, let's go through each respondent one by one.

Looking at Respondent 20: Their 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is 3, which is too high. Skip.

Respondent 2: Their 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is 1. Now check the comments. The comments are empty. So, no 'Clear' here. Doesn't meet both criteria.

Respondent 23: Their GRS is 3. Skip.

Respondent 4: GRS is 2. Not 1. Skip.

Respondent 7: GRS is 2. Skip.

Respondent 19: GRS is 3. Skip.

Respondent 9: GRS is 2. Skip.

Respondent 3: GRS is 3. Skip.

Respondent 16: GRS is 3. Skip.

Respondent 21: GRS is 3. Skip.

Respondent 15: GRS is 2. Skip.

Respondent 17: GRS is 2. Skip.

Wait, did I miss anyone? Let me check again. The task is to find those with GRS 1 and comments containing 'Clear'. 

Looking back at Respondent 2: GRS is 1, but comments are empty. So no. Are there any others with GRS 1? Let me check all again:

Respondent 2: GRS 1, comments empty.

Respondent 3: GRS 3.

Respondent 9: GRS 2.

Respondent 15: GRS 2.

Respondent 17: GRS 2.

No other respondents have GRS 1. So, even though some comments have 'Clear' (like Respondent 15's comment is ""Detailed Response - clear communication"" and Respondent 17's ""Concise - clear""), their GRS is 2. 

Wait, Respondent 9's comments: ""Overall a bit unclear communication reflected"" – that's not 'Clear'. Respondent 15's comment has 'clear communication', which includes 'clear'. But their GRS is 2, so they don't meet the GRS 1 requirement. Similarly, Respondent 17's comment has 'clear' but GRS 2. 

So, the only respondent with GRS 1 is Respondent 2, but their comments are empty. Therefore, there are no respondents who meet both criteria. But wait, let me check again. Did I miss any respondents?

Wait, looking back at the data:

Wait, the example given in the initial data had an answer of 15, but that was for a different question. The current task is different. Let me make sure I didn't miss any other respondents. Let me list all GRS scores:

Respondent 20: 3

Respondent 2: 1

Respondent 23:3

Respondent4:2

Respondent7:2

Respondent19:3

Respondent9:2

Respondent3:3

Respondent16:3

Respondent21:3

Respondent15:2

Respondent17:2

So only Respondent 2 has GRS 1, but their comments are empty. Therefore, there are no respondents who meet both conditions. But wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the comments again for any other respondents with 'Clear' in their comments and GRS 1.

Wait, the task is to find those with GRS 1 AND comments containing 'Clear'. Since the only GRS 1 is Respondent 2, and their comments are empty, there are no matches. But maybe I'm missing something. Let me check all comments again:

Respondent 2: Comments are empty.

Respondent 23: Comments mention ""Talking to registrav could not summarize the condition of patient very clearly"" – here, 'clearly' is present, but the GRS is 3. So even if 'clearly' is part of the comment, the GRS is not 1.

Respondent 15: Comments: ""Detailed Response - clear communication"" – 'clear' is present, but GRS is 2.

Respondent 17: Comments: ""Concise - clear"" – 'clear' is present, GRS 2.

So, no one with GRS 1 has 'Clear' in comments. Therefore, the answer should be that there are no such respondents. But maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again.

Wait, the task says ""scored 1 on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and whose 'Comments' contain the word 'Clear'"". So, the answer is none. But the example in the initial data had an answer, but that was for a different question. So, in this case, the correct answer is that there are no respondents meeting both criteria. However, perhaps I overlooked a respondent. Let me check once more.

Wait, Respondent 3: Comments: ""Clear communication between Reg and colleague during handover"" – 'Clear' is present here. But their GRS is 3. So, GRS is 3, which doesn't meet the 1 requirement. So, no.

So, the conclusion is that there are no respondents who scored 1 on GRS and have 'Clear' in comments. But the system might expect an answer. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in reading the GRS scores. Let me check again.

Wait, looking at the data again:

Looking for 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' = 1. The only one is Respondent 2. Their comments are empty. So, no 'Clear' in comments. Therefore, the answer is that there are no respondents meeting both criteria. But the output rules say to provide a list, even if empty. So, the answer would be an empty list. But according to the output rules, if the task is to list names or IDs, provide a comma-separated list. Since there are none, perhaps the answer is an empty string. But maybe I missed a respondent. Let me check once more.

Alternatively, perhaps the task is case-insensitive. The comments have 'clear' in lowercase. The task says to check if the comments contain the word 'Clear' (case-insensitive). So, 'clear' in any case. But in the data, Respondent 15's comment is ""Detailed Response - clear communication"" (lowercase 'c'), and Respondent 17's comment is ""Concise - clear"" (lowercase 'c'). The task says to look for the word 'Clear', but case-insensitively. So, 'clear' would count. However, the output instructions say to preserve capitalization as in the schema. Wait, no: the output for open-ended fields is the exact text value. But the task is to check if the comment contains the word 'Clear' (case-insensitive). So, regardless of case, if the comment has 'clear', 'Clear', 'CLEAR', etc., it should be considered. 

But in the data, the comments that have 'clear' (lowercase) are:

Respondent 15: ""clear communication""

Respondent 17: ""clear""

Respondent 23: ""clearly"" (but that's a different word)

So, if the task is to find comments containing the word 'Clear' (case-insensitive), then 'clear' in lowercase would count. So, Respondents 15 and 17 have 'clear' in their comments. But their GRS is 2. The only GRS 1 is Respondent 2, who has no comments. Therefore, no matches. So the answer is that there are no respondents meeting both criteria. But the output requires a list. If there are none, perhaps the answer is an empty list. But according to the output rules, if the task asks for a list, provide a comma-separated list. If none, maybe just say ""None"" or leave it blank. But the example in the initial data had an answer of ""15"", which was a number. But in this case, perhaps the answer is that there are no such respondents. However, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check once more.

Wait, perhaps I misread a respondent's GRS. Let me check all GRS scores again:

Respondent 20: 3

Respondent 2: 1

Respondent 23:3

Respondent4:2

Respondent7:2

Respondent19:3

Respondent9:2

Respondent3:3

Respondent16:3

Respondent21:3

Respondent15:2

Respondent17:2

Yes, only Respondent 2 has GRS 1. So, no one else. Therefore, the answer is that there are no respondents meeting both criteria. But the output format requires a list. If there are none, perhaps the answer is an empty string. But according to the output rules, if the task asks for a list, provide a comma-separated list. If none, maybe just leave it empty. But the system might expect an answer. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the comments. Let me check again.

Wait, Respondent 3's comments: ""Clear communication between Reg and colleague during handover"" – here, 'Clear' is capitalized. So, the comment contains 'Clear'. But their GRS is 3. So, even though the comment has 'Clear', the GRS is 3, not 1. So, no match.

So, the conclusion is that there are no respondents who meet both criteria. Therefore, the answer is an empty list. But according to the output rules, if the task is to list names or IDs, provide a comma-separated list. Since there are none, the answer is an empty string. However, the example in the initial data had an answer of ""15"", which was a single respondent. But in this case, there are none. So, the answer is that there are no such respondents. But how to represent that? The output rules say to provide the answer directly. If the answer is none, perhaps the answer is ""None"" or just leave it blank. But according to the output rules, for a list, it's a comma-separated list. If there are no entries, maybe just leave it empty. But the user might expect to see ""None"" if that's the case. However, the example answer was ""15"", which is a number. But in this case, the answer is that there are no respondents meeting the criteria. So, the answer is that there are none. But how to present that? The output instructions say to provide the answer directly. If the task is to list, and there are none, perhaps the answer is an empty string. But maybe the correct answer is that there are no respondents, so the answer is ""None"". However, the output rules don't specify, but the example shows a number. So, perhaps the answer is ""None"" or ""No respondents found"". But according to the output rules, for a list, it's a comma-separated list. If there are none, perhaps the answer is an empty string. But I need to check the output rules again.

The output rules state: ""If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., '17, 21, 23')"". So, if there are no such respondents, the answer would be an empty string. But in the example, the answer was ""15"", which is a single ID. So, in this case, since there are no respondents meeting the criteria, the answer is an empty list. Therefore, the answer is nothing. But perhaps the correct answer is that there are no respondents, so the answer is empty. However, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check once more.

Wait, perhaps I missed a respondent. Let me check all respondents again:

Looking for GRS = 1: only Respondent 2.

Comments containing 'Clear' (case-insensitive):

Respondent 3: ""Clear communication..."" (GRS 3)

Respondent 15: ""clear communication"" (GRS 2)

Respondent 17: ""clear"" (GRS 2)

Respondent 23: ""clearly"" (GRS 3) – but 'clearly' is a different word.

So, none of the respondents with GRS 1 have 'Clear' in their comments. Therefore, the answer is that there are no such respondents. Hence, the answer is an empty list. But how to represent that? According to the output rules, if it's a list, provide a comma-separated list. If none, perhaps just leave it blank. But the user might expect ""None"" or similar. However, the example answer was a number. But in this case, the answer is that there are no respondents. So, the answer is an empty string. But maybe the system expects ""None"". However, according to the output rules, the answer should be the human-readable value. If the task is to list, and there are none, perhaps the answer is ""None"". But I'm not sure. The example answer was ""15"", which is a number. But in this case, the answer is that there are no respondents. So, the answer is ""None"". But I need to follow the output rules strictly. The output rules say: ""If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., '17, 21, 23')"". So, if there are none, the list is empty. But how to represent that? Maybe just leave it blank. But the user might expect ""None"". However, the example in the initial data had an answer of ""15"", which is a single ID. So, in this case, since there are no respondents, the answer is an empty string. But perhaps the correct answer is that there are no respondents, so the answer is ""None"". But according to the output rules, it's better to follow the example. Since the example provided a number, but in this case, there are none, perhaps the answer is ""None"". However, the output rules don't mention ""None"" explicitly. They say to provide the answer directly. So, if there are no respondents, the answer is an empty string. But maybe the user expects ""None"". 

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in reading the data. Let me check Respondent 2 again. Their GRS is 1, and comments are empty. So, no. So, the answer is that there are no respondents meeting both criteria. Therefore, the answer is an empty list. But according to the output rules, the answer should be a comma-separated list. So, the answer is an empty string. But perhaps the correct answer is ""None"". However, I'll proceed with the conclusion that there are no such respondents.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents who scored 3 on 'Identification' and whose 'Comments' contain the word 'Time'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The question is asking to list all respondents who scored 3 on 'Identification' and whose 'Comments' contain the word 'Time'. 

First, I need to look at the 'Identification' rubric. From the questions section, the Identification field has a rubric where 3 means ""Introduces themselves and information is complete"". So I need to filter all respondents with a 3 in their Identification score.

Next, check the 'Comments' field for each of those respondents to see if the word 'Time' is present. The comments are open-ended, so I have to look for the exact word, case-sensitive as per the data. 

Looking at the responses:

- Respondent 6: Identification is 3. Comments are empty. No 'Time' here.
- Respondent 1: Identification is -1, so skip.
- Respondent 14: Identification 3. Comments mention ""Time: (2:36-2:53)"". So this one qualifies.
- Respondent 15: Identification 3. Comments don't have 'Time'.
- Respondent 16: Identification 3. Comments don't mention 'Time'.
- Respondent 10: Identification 2. Skip.
- Respondent 2: Identification 3. Comments are empty.
- Respondent 8: Identification 3. Comments mention ""Clear communication..."" but no 'Time'.

So only Respondent 14 meets both criteria. Let me double-check. Yes, Respondent 14 has Identification 3 and 'Time' in comments. No others. The answer should be 14.

<task>
Which respondents have a total score for 'Background (history)' and 'Background (examination)' greater than 4?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The question is asking which respondents have a total score for 'Background (history)' and 'Background (examination)' greater than 4. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The 'Background (history)' and 'Background (examination)' are both rubric-based questions with scores from 0 to 3. The total score would be the sum of these two for each respondent.

Looking at the responses, each respondent has entries for both 'Background (history)' and 'Background (examination)'. My job is to go through each respondent, add those two scores, check if the sum is greater than 4, and list the respondents who meet that condition.

Let's start with Respondent 23. Their history is 2 and examination is 2. 2+2=4, which is not greater than 4. So they don't qualify.

Respondent 10: Both are 2. 2+2=4. Not greater. Next.

Respondent 15: History is 2, examination is 3. 2+3=5. That's greater than 4. So Respondent 15 is in.

Respondent 3: History is 3, examination is 3. 3+3=6. Definitely greater. So Respondent 3 is included.

Respondent 8: History 3, examination 2. 3+2=5. That's a yes. Respondent 8.

Respondent 9: Both are 2. Sum 4. No.

Respondent 7: History 2, exam 3. Sum 5. Yes, Respondent 7.

Respondent 14: Both 2. Sum 4. No.

Respondent 2: History 2, exam 3. Sum 5. So Respondent 2.

Respondent 18: Both 2. Sum 4. No.

Wait, let me double-check each:

- 23: 2+2=4 → no
- 10: 2+2=4 → no
- 15: 2+3=5 → yes
- 3: 3+3=6 → yes
- 8: 3+2=5 → yes
- 9: 2+2=4 → no
- 7: 2+3=5 → yes
- 14: 2+2=4 → no
- 2: 2+3=5 → yes
- 18: 2+2=4 → no

So the respondents with total scores over 4 are 15, 3, 8, 7, and 2. Let me check the data again to make sure I didn't miss any.

Wait, Respondent 3's 'Background (history)' is 3 and 'examination' is 3. Sum 6. Correct. Respondent 2: history 2, exam 3. Sum 5. Yes. Respondent 7: 2+3=5. Yes. Respondent 8: 3+2=5. Yes. Respondent 15: 2+3=5. Yes. 

So the list should be 3, 8, 15, 7, 2. But wait, the order in the data is 23,10,15,3,8,9,7,14,2,18. So the respondents are 3,8,15,7,2. Let me check if any others were missed. No, that's all. So the answer is these five respondents: 3, 8, 15, 7, 2. But wait, the example given in the problem had the answer as 15, but that was for a different question. But in this case, the correct answer is the list of respondents where the sum is greater than 4. So the final answer should be the IDs of these respondents in a comma-separated list.

</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The goal is to list all respondents who scored 3 on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and have the word 'unclear' in their Comments.

First, I need to understand the data structure. The 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' field has a rubric where 3 means ""Clear comprehensive recommendation without questioning."" So I need to filter respondents with a score of 3 here.

Next, the Comments field must contain the word 'unclear'. I'll check each respondent's Comments for that exact term, case-insensitive, but looking for the presence of 'unclear'.

Looking at the responses:

- Respondent 21: Recommendation (clear recommendation) is 3. Comments mention ""Diagnostic clarity"" and ""Good...assessment."" No 'unclear' here. So exclude.
- Respondent 5: Score 2. Doesn't meet the first condition. Skip.
- Respondent 9: Score 3. Comments say ""Overall a bit unclear communication reflected."" Here, 'unclear' is present. So include Respondent 9.
- Respondent 22: Score 2. Exclude.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents who scored 2 on 'Assessment' and whose 'Comments' contain the word 'Clear'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The goal is to list all respondents who scored 2 on 'Assessment' and whose 'Comments' contain the word 'Clear'. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The 'Questions' section defines each field. The 'Assessment' field has a rubric where a score of 2 means ""Assessment after minimal questioning"". The 'Comments' field is open-ended, so I need to check if the text includes the word 'Clear' in any form, considering case sensitivity.

Now, I'll go through each respondent in the 'Responses' section and check the two conditions:

1. **Assessment Score of 2**: Look at each respondent's 'Assessment' value.
2. **Comments containing 'Clear'**: Check if their 'Comments' field has the word 'Clear' (case-sensitive as per the output rules).

Let's list out each respondent:

- **Respondent 10**: Assessment is 2. Comments: ""Time: (15:53-16:14)"" – no 'Clear' here. **Exclude**.
- **Respondent 15**: Assessment 2. Comments: ""Detailed Response - clear communication"" – 'clear' is present but lowercase. Wait, the output rules say to preserve capitalization. The schema's example uses ""Clear"" with a capital C. However, the actual comment here uses lowercase 'clear'. The task says 'contain the word 'Clear'', which is case-sensitive. So 'clear' doesn't match 'Clear'. **Exclude**.
- **Respondent 4**: Assessment 2. Comments mention ""Clinical handover and communication skills, satisfactory"" – no 'Clear'. **Exclude**.
- **Respondent 22**: Assessment 2. Comments: ""Clear communication skills"" – 'Clear' is present. **Include**.
- **Respondent 23**: Assessment 3. Doesn't meet the first condition. **Exclude**.
- **Respondent 13**: Assessment 2. Comments mention ""Lack of communication..."" – no 'Clear'. **Exclude**.
- **Respondent 9**: Assessment 2. Comments: ""Overall a bit unclear communication reflected"" – 'unclear' isn't 'Clear'. **Exclude**.
- **Respondent 16**: Assessment 3. **Exclude**.
- **Respondent 8**: Assessment 2. Comments: ""Clear communication during handover"" – 'Clear' here. **Include**.
- **Respondent 2**: Assessment 3. **Exclude**.
- **Respondent 19**: Assessment 2. Comments: ""Clarity is a bit low..."" – 'Clarity' not 'Clear'. **Exclude**.
- **Respondent 1**: Assessment 3. **Exclude**.

So, the respondents meeting both criteria are 22 and 8. Wait, let me double-check:

Respondent 22: Assessment 2, Comments have ""Clear communication skills"" – yes.  
Respondent 8: Assessment 2, Comments: ""Clear communication during handover"" – yes.  

Are there others? Let me check again. Respondent 15's comment has 'clear' lowercase, which doesn't match 'Clear' as per case sensitivity. So only 22 and 8. But wait, the example given in the problem had an answer of 15, but that was for a different query. Here, the task is different. 

Wait, the example isn't part of the current task. So focusing on the current task: Assessment=2 and Comments have 'Clear'. 

Yes, respondents 22 and 8. Their IDs are 22 and 8. So the answer should be ""22, 8"".

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' is higher than the average 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' for all sessions on the same date.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find all respondents whose 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' score is higher than the average for all sessions on the same date. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' is a rubric-based score ranging from 0 to 3. Each respondent has a date and a score for this category. 

The approach should be:
1. For each respondent, determine their 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' score.
2. For each date present in the data, calculate the average of all 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' scores for that date.
3. Compare each respondent's score to the average of their respective date.
4. Collect all respondents where their score is higher than the average for their date.

Let's start by listing all the respondents and their dates along with their 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' scores. 

Looking at the responses:

- Respondent 11: Date 2025-04-04, Score 3
- Respondent 20: 2025-05-02, 2
- Respondent 9: 2025-05-04, 3
- Respondent 1: 2025-05-02, 2
- Respondent 3: 2025-04-04, 3
- Respondent 8: 2025-05-02, 2
- Respondent 22: 2025-05-16, 2
- Respondent 21: 2025-05-16, 3
- Respondent 10: 2025-03-14, 2
- Respondent 17: 2025-05-04, 3
- Respondent 13: 2025-03-14, 2

Now, group the scores by date:

- 2025-03-14: Respondents 10 and 13, both with score 2. Average = (2 + 2)/2 = 2
- 2025-04-04: Respondents 11 and 3, both with score 3. Average = (3 + 3)/2 = 3
- 2025-05-02: Respondents 20, 1, 8. Scores: 2, 2, 2. Average = (2+2+2)/3 = 2
- 2025-05-04: Respondents 9 and 17. Scores: 3 and 3. Average = 3
- 2025-05-16: Respondents 22 and 21. Scores: 2 and 3. Average = (2+3)/2 = 2.5

Next, compare each respondent's score to their date's average:

- 2025-03-14: Both have 2, which equals the average. So none here.
- 2025-04-04: Both have 3, which equals the average. No one above.
- 2025-05-02: All have 2, average is 2. No one above.
- 2025-05-04: Both have 3, average is 3. No one above.
- 2025-05-16: Respondent 22 has 2 (below 2.5), Respondent 21 has 3 (above 2.5). So Respondent 21 is above average.

Wait, but looking at the data again, Respondent 21's 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' is 3, and the average for 2025-05-16 is 2.5. So 3 is higher than 2.5. Therefore, Respondent 21 should be included.

Are there any other dates? Let me check again. The dates are 2025-03-14, 2025-04-04, 2025-05-02, 2025-05-04, 2025-05-16. 

So the only respondent with a score higher than the date's average is Respondent 21. 

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations. For 2025-05-16, the two respondents are 22 (score 2) and 21 (score 3). The average is (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5. So 3 is higher than 2.5. Therefore, Respondent 21 is the only one. 

But wait, are there any other dates where a respondent's score is higher than the average? Let's check each date again.

For 2025-03-14: average 2, all scores are 2. No one above.

2025-04-04: average 3, all scores 3. No one above.

2025-05-02: average 2, all scores 2. No one above.

2025-05-04: average 3, all scores 3. No one above.

2025-05-16: average 2.5. Respondent 21 has 3, which is higher. So only Respondent 21.

But wait, looking at the data again, Respondent 21's date is 2025-05-16, and their 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' is 3. The other respondent on that date is 22 with 2. So average is 2.5. Therefore, 3 is higher. So Respondent 21 is the only one.

But let me check all respondents again to make sure I didn't miss any. The list includes Respondents 11,20,9,1,3,8,22,21,10,17,13. 

Yes, that's all. So the answer should be Respondent 21.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'Identification' is higher than the average 'Identification' for all sessions on the same date.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find all respondents whose 'Identification' score is higher than the average 'Identification' for all sessions on the same date. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The 'Identification' field is a rubric-based score from 0 to 3. Each respondent has a date, and their Identification score. The goal is to compare each respondent's Identification score against the average of all respondents from the same date. If their score is higher than that average, include them in the result.

Let me start by listing all respondents with their dates and Identification scores:

- Respondent 16: 2025-05-02, Identification 3
- Respondent 17: 2025-05-04, 3
- Respondent 21: 2025-05-16, 3
- Respondent 15: 2025-05-04, 3
- Respondent 9: 2025-05-04, 3
- Respondent 6: 2025-04-04, 3
- Respondent 14: 2025-03-14, 3
- Respondent 23: 2025-03-14, 3
- Respondent 2: 2025-04-04, 3

Wait, looking at all the respondents, every single one has an Identification score of 3. That's interesting. So, for each date, the average Identification score would be 3, since all respondents on every date have 3. 

For example, take 2025-05-04. Respondents 17, 15, 9 are all on that date, each with 3. The average is (3+3+3)/3 = 3. So, any respondent on that date with a score higher than 3 would be included, but since all have exactly 3, none are higher. The same applies to all other dates. 

Therefore, there are no respondents whose Identification score is higher than the average for their date. But wait, the answer in the example was 15. Let me check the example again. Oh, the example's answer was for a different question (sessions on 2025-05-04 with Situation score 3). So in this case, the current task is different. 

But according to the data provided, all Identification scores are 3. So the average for each date is 3. Therefore, no one has a score higher than the average. But maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check each respondent's Identification score. 

Looking at each respondent:

- Respondent 16: 3
- 17:3
- 21:3
- 15:3
- 9:3
- 6:3
- 14:3
- 23:3
- 2:3

Yes, all are 3. So the average for each date is 3. Therefore, no one has a higher score than the average. But the task says ""higher than the average"", not ""higher than or equal"". So the answer should be none. But the data might have a different scenario. Wait, maybe I missed a respondent with a lower score. Let me check again. 

Looking through all the respondents again, every single one has Identification 3. So the average for each date is 3. Therefore, there are no respondents with a score higher than the average. The answer should be an empty list. But the example answer was 15, but that was for a different question. 

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the data entry. Let me check again. For example, Respondent 15: Identification 3. All others on 2025-05-04 (17,15,9) have 3. So average is 3. So none are higher. 

Therefore, the answer is that there are no respondents meeting the criteria. But since the system might expect a list, maybe the answer is an empty string or ""None"". However, according to the output rules, if it's a list, provide a comma-separated list. If there are none, perhaps the answer is an empty string. But the example answer was ""15"" for a different question, but in this case, the answer is no one. 

But wait, maybe I miscalculated. Let me check each date's average:

- 2025-03-14: Respondents 14 and 23, both 3. Average 3.
- 2025-04-04: Respondents 6 and 2, both 3. Average 3.
- 2025-05-02: Respondent 16, 3. Average 3.
- 2025-05-04: Respondents 17,15,9. All 3. Average 3.
- 2025-05-16: Respondent 21, 3. Average 3.

So in all cases, the average is 3, and all respondents have 3. Therefore, no one has a higher score. So the answer is that there are no such respondents. But the output format says to provide a simple comma-separated list. If there are none, maybe the answer is an empty string. But according to the output rules, if the task is to list names or IDs, provide the list. If none, perhaps just leave it blank. But the system might expect ""None"" or similar. However, the example answer in the previous task was just the number. But in this case, since all are equal, the answer is none. 

But the user might have made a mistake in the data entry. Let me check again. Wait, looking at Respondent 2: Identification is 3. All others are 3. So yes, all are 3. Therefore, the answer is that there are no respondents with Identification higher than the average on their date. So the answer is an empty list. But according to the output rules, if it's a list, provide a comma-separated list. If there are none, perhaps the answer is empty. But maybe the system expects ""None"" or similar. However, the example answer was just the number. But in this case, the answer is no one. So the final answer is an empty string, but according to the output rules, if the task asks for a list, provide a list. So the answer is nothing, but how to represent that. Maybe the answer is ""None"". But the output rules say for a count, provide the number. For a list, comma-separated. If there are no items, perhaps just leave it blank. But the user might expect a specific answer. 

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again. All respondents have Identification 3, so the average for each date is 3. Therefore, no one is higher. So the answer is that there are no respondents meeting the criteria. Therefore, the answer is an empty list. But according to the output instructions, if the task asks for a list, provide a comma-separated list. If there are none, perhaps the answer is an empty string. But the system might not accept that. Alternatively, maybe the answer is ""None"". But the example in the problem had an answer of ""15"" which was a number, but that was a different question. 

In conclusion, based on the data provided, there are no respondents with an Identification score higher than the average for their date. Therefore, the answer is an empty list. But how to represent that? The output rules say for a list, provide a simple comma-separated list. If there are none, perhaps the answer is an empty string. But maybe the system expects ""None"". However, according to the output rules, if the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list. Since there are none, the answer is an empty list. So the answer is nothing. But the system might require a response. Alternatively, maybe I missed a respondent. Let me check once more. 

No, all respondents have Identification 3. So the answer is that there are no such respondents. Therefore, the answer is an empty list. But how to represent that. Maybe the answer is ""None"" or just leave it blank. However, according to the output rules, if the task is to list, provide a list. So the answer is an empty string. But perhaps the correct answer is that there are no respondents, so the answer is ""None"". But the example answer was ""15"" which was a number. But in this case, the answer is no one. So the final answer is an empty string. But the system might expect a specific format. Alternatively, maybe the answer is ""No respondents"" but according to the output rules, it should be a simple comma-separated list. So perhaps the answer is just empty. But the user might expect a different answer. 

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the data. Let me check again. 

Looking at all respondents:

- Respondent 2: Identification 3
- Respondent 6: 3
- Respondent 9:3
- Respondent14:3
- Respondent15:3
- Respondent16:3
- Respondent17:3
- Respondent21:3
- Respondent23:3

All have 3. So the average for each date is 3. Therefore, no one is higher. So the answer is that there are no respondents. Therefore, the answer is an empty list. But how to represent that. According to the output rules, if the task is to list names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list. Since there are none, the answer is an empty string. But maybe the system expects ""None"". However, the example answer was ""15"" which was a number. But in this case, the answer is no one. So the final answer is an empty string. But perhaps the correct answer is ""None"". However, the output rules don't mention that. They say for a list, comma-separated. So if there are none, just leave it blank. But the user might expect a response. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the data. For example, maybe a respondent has a higher score. But according to the data given, all are 3. So the answer is no one. Therefore, the answer is an empty list. So the final answer is nothing, but according to the output rules, the answer should be the human-readable value, which in this case is an empty list. So the answer is nothing. But the system might require a response. Alternatively, maybe the answer is ""None"". But I'll proceed with the conclusion that there are no respondents meeting the criteria.
</think>

The task requires identifying respondents whose 'Identification' score is higher than the average for their session date. All respondents have an 'Identification' score of **3**, and the average for each date is also **3** (since all respondents on every date scored 3). Therefore, no respondents have a score **higher** than the average.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondents participated in a session where the average 'Assessment' for that session name is greater than 2.0?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find which respondents participated in a session where the average 'Assessment' score for that session name is greater than 2.0. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The responses include various respondents, each with a SessionName and an Assessment score. The goal is to group respondents by their SessionName, calculate the average Assessment for each session, and then identify which respondents are part of sessions where this average exceeds 2.0.

Let me start by listing all the respondents along with their SessionName and Assessment scores:

- Respondent 12: SessionName II (Anaphylaxis), Assessment 2
- Respondent 14: IV-Hypoglycemia, Assessment 3
- Respondent 11: IV (AF), Assessment 3
- Respondent 21: I (Myocardial infarction), Assessment 2
- Respondent 4: III (Sepsis), Assessment 2
- Respondent 6: II (Anaphylactic Shock), Assessment 2
- Respondent 20: IV (VT), Assessment 3
- Respondent 22: IV (VT), Assessment 2
- Respondent 23: II-Anaphylaxsis, Assessment 3
- Respondent 8: III (Sepsis), Assessment 2
- Respondent 5: II - Anaphylaxsis, Assessment 3

Next, I need to group these by SessionName. Let's note that some SessionNames might be the same but written differently. For example, ""II (Anaphylaxis)"", ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"", ""II-Anaphylaxsis"", and ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" could be variations of the same session. However, the exact SessionName as provided in the data must be considered. Let's check each SessionName:

Looking at the data:

- II (Anaphylaxis) (Respondent 12)
- IV-Hypoglycemia (Respondent 14)
- IV (AF) (Respondent 11)
- I (Myocardial infarction) (Respondent 21)
- III (Sepsis) (Respondents 4 and 8)
- II (Anaphylactic Shock) (Respondent 6)
- IV (VT) (Respondents 20 and 22)
- II-Anaphylaxsis (Respondent 23)
- II - Anaphylaxsis (Respondent 5)

Wait, ""III (Sepsis)"" has two respondents (4 and 8), both with Assessment 2. The average for III (Sepsis) would be (2 + 2)/2 = 2.0, which is not greater than 2.0, so they don't qualify.

IV (VT) has two respondents: 20 (Assessment 3) and 22 (Assessment 2). Average is (3+2)/2 = 2.5, which is greater than 2.0. So both 20 and 22 would be included.

IV-Hypoglycemia (Respondent 14) has Assessment 3. Average is 3, so 14 is included.

IV (AF) (Respondent 11) has Assessment 3. Average is 3, so 11 is included.

II-Anaphylaxsis (Respondent 23) and II - Anaphylaxsis (Respondent 5) might be considered the same session? Let's check the SessionNames. The data shows ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" for 23 and ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" for 5. The hyphen vs. space and hyphen might be a typo, but according to the data, they are different SessionNames. So each is treated separately. 

Respondent 23's SessionName is ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" with Assessment 3. Since it's only one respondent, average is 3, which is >2.0. So 23 is included.

Respondent 5's SessionName is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" (with a space and hyphen), and their Assessment is 3. Average is 3, so 5 is included.

Similarly, ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" (Respondent 12) has Assessment 2. Average is 2, which is not >2.0. So 12 is excluded.

""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"" (Respondent 6) has Assessment 2. Average is 2, so excluded.

""I (Myocardial infarction)"" (Respondent 21) has Assessment 2. Average is 2, excluded.

So the sessions with average >2.0 are:

- IV-Hypoglycemia (14)
- IV (AF) (11)
- IV (VT) (20,22)
- II-Anaphylaxsis (23)
- II - Anaphylaxsis (5)

Wait, but ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" and ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" are different SessionNames as per the data. So each is a separate session. So each has one respondent with Assessment 3. So their averages are 3 each, which is >2.0. So respondents 23 and 5 are included.

So compiling all the respondents in these sessions:

- 14 (IV-Hypoglycemia)
- 11 (IV (AF))
- 20 (IV (VT))
- 22 (IV (VT))
- 23 (II-Anaphylaxsis)
- 5 (II - Anaphylaxsis)

So the answer should be these respondents: 5, 11, 14, 20, 22, 23.

Wait, let me double-check each session's average:

IV-Hypoglycemia: only Respondent 14, Assessment 3 → average 3.0 >2.0 → include 14.

IV (AF): only Respondent 11, Assessment 3 → average 3.0 → include 11.

IV (VT): Respondents 20 (3) and 22 (2) → average (3+2)/2=2.5 → include 20 and 22.

II-Anaphylaxsis: Respondent 23 (3) → average 3 → include 23.

II - Anaphylaxsis: Respondent 5 (3) → average 3 → include 5.

Other sessions:

III (Sepsis): Respondents 4 (2) and 8 (2) → average 2.0 → not included.

II (Anaphylaxis): Respondent 12 (2) → average 2.0 → not included.

II (Anaphylactic Shock): Respondent 6 (2) → average 2.0 → not included.

I (Myocardial infarction): Respondent 21 (2) → average 2.0 → not included.

So the correct respondents are 5, 11, 14, 20, 22, 23. Let me check the data again to ensure I didn't miss any.

Looking back:

Respondent 5: Date 2025-05-04, SessionName II - Anaphylaxsis, Assessment 3.

Respondent 11: IV (AF), Assessment 3.

Respondent 14: IV-Hypoglycemia, Assessment 3.

Respondent 20: IV (VT), Assessment 3.

Respondent 22: IV (VT), Assessment 2. So their average is (3+2)/2=2.5, which is >2.0, so both 20 and 22 are included.

Respondent 23: II-Anaphylaxsis, Assessment 3.

Yes, that's all. So the answer is 5,11,14,20,22,23.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'Background (examination)' is higher than the average 'Background (examination)' for all sessions on the same date.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find all respondents whose 'Background (examination)' score is higher than the average 'Background (examination)' for all sessions on the same date. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The 'Background (examination)' is a rubric-based score from 0 to 3. Each respondent has a date and a score for this category. The goal is to compare each respondent's score against the average of all respondents from the same date.

So, the first thing I need to do is calculate the average 'Background (examination)' score for each date. Then, for each respondent, check if their score is higher than the average of their respective date.

Let me list out all the respondents and their dates and Background (examination) scores:

- Respondent 18: 2025-05-04, score 2
- Respondent 2: 2025-04-04, score 3
- Respondent 15: 2025-05-04, score 3
- Respondent 3: 2025-04-04, score 3
- Respondent 11: 2025-04-04, score 3
- Respondent 9: 2025-05-04, score 2
- Respondent 19: 2025-05-16, score 3
- Respondent 4: 2025-05-16, score 2
- Respondent 13: 2025-03-14, score 1
- Respondent 7: 2025-03-14, score 3
- Respondent 23: 2025-03-14, score 2

Now, group them by date and calculate the average for each group:

1. 2025-03-14:
   - Scores: 1 (R13), 3 (R7), 2 (R23)
   - Total = 1 + 3 + 2 = 6
   - Average = 6 / 3 = 2.0

2. 2025-04-04:
   - Scores: 3 (R2), 3 (R3), 3 (R11)
   - Total = 9
   - Average = 9 / 3 = 3.0

3. 2025-05-04:
   - Scores: 2 (R18), 3 (R15), 2 (R9)
   - Total = 7
   - Average = 7 / 3 ≈ 2.33

4. 2025-05-16:
   - Scores: 3 (R19), 2 (R4)
   - Total = 5
   - Average = 5 / 2 = 2.5

Now, compare each respondent's score to their date's average:

- R18 (2025-05-04, 2): 2 vs 2.33 → 2 < 2.33 → No
- R2 (2025-04-04, 3): 3 vs 3 → Equal → No (needs to be higher)
- R15 (2025-05-04, 3): 3 > 2.33 → Yes
- R3 (2025-04-04, 3): 3 vs 3 → No
- R11 (2025-04-04, 3): 3 vs 3 → No
- R9 (2025-05-04, 2): 2 < 2.33 → No
- R19 (2025-05-16, 3): 3 > 2.5 → Yes
- R4 (2025-05-16, 2): 2 < 2.5 → No
- R13 (2025-03-14, 1): 1 < 2 → No
- R7 (2025-03-14, 3): 3 > 2 → Yes
- R23 (2025-03-14, 2): 2 = 2 → No

So the respondents who meet the criteria are R15, R19, and R7. Their scores are higher than the average on their respective dates.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents who scored perfectly on 'Identification' and 'Background (history)' and whose 'Background (examination)' is below the average for all sessions.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to list all respondents who scored perfectly on 'Identification' and 'Background (history)' and whose 'Background (examination)' is below the average for all sessions. 

First, I need to understand the criteria. 

1. **Perfect scores on Identification and Background (history):** Both of these need to be 3, since the rubric for Identification goes up to 3, and the same for Background (history). So, I need to filter respondents where Identification is 3 and Background (history) is 3.

2. **Background (examination) below the average for all sessions:** I need to calculate the average score of Background (examination) across all respondents, then find those respondents who have a score lower than that average.

Let's start by going through each respondent and check their scores.

Looking at the data:

- **Respondent 22:** Identification=3, Background (history)=3, Background (examination)=3. So, meets the first two criteria, but examination is 3. Need to check if this is below average.

- **Respondent 18:** Identification=3, Background (history)=2. Doesn't meet the first criteria (history is 2, needs to be 3). So exclude.

- **Respondent 15:** Identification=3, Background (history)=2. Again, history is 2. Exclude.

- **Respondent 14:** Identification=3, Background (history)=2. Exclude.

- **Respondent 2:** Identification=3, Background (history)=2. Exclude.

- **Respondent 7:** Identification=3, Background (history)=2. Exclude.

- **Respondent 17:** Identification=3, Background (history)=3, Background (examination)=3. So meets first two, but examination is 3. Need to check average.

- **Respondent 12:** Identification=3, Background (history)=3, Background (examination)=3. Same as above.

So from the list, the respondents who have Identification=3 and Background (history)=3 are 22, 17, 12. Now, need to check if their Background (examination) is below the average.

Next, calculate the average for Background (examination) across all sessions. Let's list all the examination scores:

Looking at each respondent's Background (examination):

- 22: 3
- 18: 2
- 15: 3
- 14: 2
- 2: 3
- 7: 3
- 17: 3
- 12: 3

Adding these up: 3 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 22. There are 8 respondents. Average is 22 / 8 = 2.75.

So the average is 2.75. Now, any Background (examination) score below 2.75 would be 2 or lower. 

Looking at the three candidates (22, 17, 12), their examination scores are all 3. 3 is higher than 2.75, so none of them are below average. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me recalculate the average.

Wait, the respondents are 8 in total. Let me recount the examination scores:

Respondent 22: 3

18: 2

15:3

14:2

2:3

7:3

17:3

12:3

Total: 3+2=5, +3=8, +2=10, +3=13, +3=16, +3=19, +3=22. Yes, 22 total. 22 divided by 8 is 2.75. So average is 2.75. Therefore, scores below 2.75 are 2 or lower. 

The three respondents (22,17,12) all have examination=3, which is above 2.75. Therefore, none of them meet the third criteria. 

Wait, but that would mean there are no respondents who meet all three conditions. But the example given in the problem had an answer of 15, which in the example data, the correct answer was 15. But in the current dataset, perhaps the answer is different. Wait, no, the example is separate. The current task is based on the questionnaire data provided, which is different from the example. 

Wait, looking back, the user provided an example where the answer was 15, but the current task is under the <questionnaire> section. So the data to use is the one under the questionnaire, not the example. 

So according to the current data, the three respondents (22,17,12) have examination=3, which is above average. Therefore, none of them meet the third condition. So the answer would be no respondents. But that seems odd. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the average. Let me recount the examination scores:

Respondent 22: 3

18: 2

15:3

14:2

2:3

7:3

17:3

12:3

Total: 3+2=5, +3=8, +2=10, +3=13, +3=16, +3=19, +3=22. Yes, 22. 22/8=2.75. Correct.

So the average is 2.75. Therefore, any score below 2.75 is 2 or lower. The three candidates (22,17,12) all have 3, which is above average. Therefore, their examination scores are not below average. So there are no respondents who meet all three criteria. 

But that can't be right. Wait, maybe I missed a respondent. Let me check all respondents again.

Looking at the data:

- Respondent 22: Identification=3, history=3, exam=3.

- Respondent 18: Identification=3, history=2. So excluded.

- Respondent 15: Identification=3, history=2. Excluded.

- Respondent 14: Identification=3, history=2. Excluded.

- Respondent 2: Identification=3, history=2. Excluded.

- Respondent 7: Identification=3, history=2. Excluded.

- Respondent 17: Identification=3, history=3, exam=3.

- Respondent 12: Identification=3, history=3, exam=3.

So only 22,17,12 meet the first two criteria. But their exam scores are 3, which is above the average of 2.75. Therefore, none of them have exam scores below average. 

So the answer should be that there are no respondents meeting all the criteria. But the example answer was 15, but that's in a different dataset. Wait, in the example data, the answer was 15, but in the current data, perhaps the answer is different. 

Wait, looking at the current data, maybe I made a mistake in the average calculation. Let me check again. The examination scores are:

3,2,3,2,3,3,3,3. Sum is 3+2=5, +3=8, +2=10, +3=13, +3=16, +3=19, +3=22. 22 divided by 8 is 2.75. Correct. So the average is 2.75. Therefore, any score below 2.75 is 2 or lower. 

So the three respondents (22,17,12) have exam=3, which is above average. Therefore, they don't meet the third condition. 

Therefore, the answer is that there are no respondents who meet all three criteria. But the problem says to list them. So the answer would be an empty list. But maybe I made a mistake in the criteria. Let me recheck the task.

The task is: respondents who scored perfectly on 'Identification' and 'Background (history)' (so both 3) and whose 'Background (examination)' is below the average for all sessions.

So if the average is 2.75, then a score of 2 is below average. But none of the respondents who have Identification and history as 3 have exam scores below 2.75. 

Wait, but maybe I missed a respondent. Let me check all respondents again:

Looking at each respondent:

- Respondent 22: Identification=3, history=3, exam=3. So exam is 3, which is above average. Excluded.

- Respondent 18: history=2. Excluded.

- Respondent 15: history=2. Excluded.

- Respondent 14: history=2. Excluded.

- Respondent 2: history=2. Excluded.

- Respondent 7: history=2. Excluded.

- Respondent 17: Identification=3, history=3, exam=3. Excluded because exam=3 is above average.

- Respondent 12: Identification=3, history=3, exam=3. Excluded.

So no one meets all three criteria. Therefore, the answer is that there are no such respondents. But the output rules say to provide a comma-separated list. If there are none, perhaps the answer is an empty string, but the output rules don't specify. However, maybe I made a mistake in the average calculation. Let me check again.

Alternatively, perhaps the average is calculated as the mean, but maybe it's supposed to be rounded. For example, 2.75 could be considered as 3 if rounded up, but the problem says ""below the average"", so 2.75 is the exact average. So scores below 2.75 are 2 or lower. 

Therefore, the answer is that there are no respondents meeting all three criteria. But the example in the problem had an answer, but that's a different dataset. So in this case, the answer is none. But let me check again if I missed any respondents.

Wait, looking at the data again, perhaps I missed a respondent. Let me list all respondents:

Respondent 22: Date 2025-05-16, Identification 3, history 3, exam 3.

Respondent 18: 2025-05-04, Identification 3, history 2.

Respondent 15: 2025-05-04, Identification 3, history 2.

Respondent 14: 2025-03-14, Identification 3, history 2.

Respondent 2: 2025-04-04, Identification 3, history 2.

Respondent 7: 2025-03-14, Identification 3, history 2.

Respondent 17: 2025-05-04, Identification 3, history 3, exam 3.

Respondent 12: 2025-05-02, Identification 3, history 3, exam 3.

So only 22,17,12 have Identification and history as 3, but their exam is 3. So no one has exam below 2.75. Therefore, the answer is that there are no respondents meeting all criteria. But the output format requires a list. If there are none, perhaps the answer is an empty list. But the output rules say to provide a simple comma-separated list. If there are none, maybe the answer is ""None"" or just empty. But according to the output rules, if it's a count, provide the number. If it's a list, provide the list. So in this case, since there are none, the answer would be an empty string. But the example answer was 15, but that's in a different dataset. 

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the average. Let me check again. The sum is 22, divided by 8 respondents: 22/8=2.75. Correct. So the average is 2.75. Therefore, any score below that is 2 or lower. 

So the answer is that there are no respondents meeting all three criteria. Therefore, the answer is an empty list. But the output rules say to provide a simple comma-separated list. So the answer would be nothing, but maybe I should check again. 

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the data. Let me check the Background (examination) scores again:

Respondent 22: 3

18: 2

15:3

14:2

2:3

7:3

17:3

12:3

Yes, that's correct. So sum is 22. Average 2.75. So no one in the qualifying group (22,17,12) has exam below 2.75. Therefore, the answer is no respondents. So the answer is an empty list. But according to the output rules, if the task is to list names or IDs, provide a comma-separated list. So in this case, the answer is an empty string. But maybe the user expects a different approach. 

Wait, perhaps the average is calculated only for the sessions where the respondent is part of the group that meets the first two criteria. Wait, the task says ""Background (examination) is below the average for all sessions"". So the average is across all sessions, not just those who meet the first two criteria. So my calculation is correct. 

Therefore, the answer is that there are no respondents meeting all three criteria. So the answer is an empty list. But the output format requires a list. So the answer is nothing. But maybe I made a mistake. Let me check once more. 

Alternatively, perhaps the average is calculated as an integer. For example, 2.75 rounded to 3. Then, below average would be 2 or lower. But even then, the three respondents have exam=3, which is equal to the rounded average. So still not below. 

Alternatively, maybe the average is calculated as a floor. But the problem doesn't specify. The task says ""below the average"", so it's a strict less than. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that there are no respondents meeting all three criteria. So the answer is an empty list. But according to the output rules, if the task is to list names or IDs, provide a comma-separated list. If there are none, perhaps the answer is an empty string. But the example in the problem had an answer, but that's a different dataset. 

In the current dataset, the answer is that there are no such respondents. Therefore, the answer is an empty list. But the output rules say to provide the human-readable value. If the task is to list IDs, and there are none, perhaps the answer is ""None"" or just leave it blank. But according to the output rules, for a list, provide a comma-separated list. So if there are none, maybe the answer is an empty string. However, the user might expect a different approach. 

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the criteria. Let me re-express the task:

List all respondents who:

1. Scored perfectly on 'Identification' (3) and 'Background (history)' (3).

2. Their 'Background (examination)' is below the average for all sessions.

So step 1: filter respondents with Identification=3 and Background (history)=3. That gives 22,17,12.

Step 2: calculate the average of Background (examination) across all sessions. As done before, average is 2.75.

Step 3: check if their examination score is below 2.75. All three have 3, which is not below. So no one qualifies.

Therefore, the answer is that there are no respondents meeting the criteria. So the answer is an empty list. But according to the output rules, for a list, provide a comma-separated list. So the answer is nothing. But maybe the user expects a different answer. 

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the average calculation. Let me check again. The sum of all examination scores is 3+2+3+2+3+3+3+3=22. 22 divided by 8 is 2.75. Correct. So the average is 2.75. Therefore, any score below 2.75 is 2 or lower. 

Therefore, the answer is that there are no respondents. So the final answer is an empty list. But how to represent that? The output rules say to provide a simple comma-separated list. If there are none, perhaps the answer is an empty string. But maybe the user expects a different approach. 

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the data. Let me check the respondents again. 

Wait, Respondent 17: Background (examination)=3. Respondent 12: 3. Respondent 22:3. All three. So no one has examination below 2.75. 

Therefore, the answer is that there are no respondents. So the answer is an empty list. But according to the output instructions, if the task is to list names or IDs, provide a comma-separated list. So the answer is nothing. But maybe the user expects a different answer, but based on the data, this is correct.
</think>

The respondents who scored perfectly on 'Identification' (3) and 'Background (history)' (3) are 22, 17, and 12. The average 'Background (examination)' score across all sessions is 2.75. Since all three respondents have a score of 3 in 'Background (examination)', which is above the average, none meet the criteria of being below the average.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents who scored perfectly on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and whose 'Background (history)' is below the average for all sessions.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The goal is to list all respondents who scored perfectly on both 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)', and whose 'Background (history)' score is below the average of all sessions. 

First, I need to understand the criteria. 

1. **Perfect scores on the two recommendation fields:**
   - 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' has a rubric where 3 is the highest score. So, the respondent must have a 3 here.
   - 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' also has a maximum of 3. So, they need a 3 here as well.

2. **Background (history) below average:**
   - Calculate the average score for 'Background (history)' across all respondents.
   - Then, check which respondents have a score lower than this average.

Let me start by extracting the necessary data from the responses.

**Step 1: Identify respondents with perfect scores in both recommendation fields.**

Looking through each respondent:

- **Respondent 16:**
  - Global rating: 3
  - Clear recommendation: 2 → Doesn't meet both 3s.

- **Respondent 21:**
  - Global: 3
  - Clear: 3 → Meets both. Check history later.

- **Respondent 15:**
  - Global: 2, Clear: 2 → No.

- **Respondent 2:**
  - Global: 1, Clear: 2 → No.

- **Respondent 7:**
  - Global: 2, Clear: 2 → No.

- **Respondent 9:**
  - Global: 2, Clear: 3 → No.

- **Respondent 5:**
  - Global: 3, Clear: 2 → No.

- **Respondent 10:**
  - Global: 2, Clear: 2 → No.

- **Respondent 8:**
  - Global: 3, Clear: 2 → No.

- **Respondent 12:**
  - Global: 3, Clear: 3 → Meets both. Check history.

- **Respondent 22:**
  - Global: 3, Clear: 2 → No.

- **Respondent 20:**
  - Global: 3, Clear: 2 → No.

So, the respondents who have both recommendation scores as 3 are **21, 12**.

**Step 2: Calculate the average for Background (history).**

First, collect all 'Background (history)' scores:

- 16: 3
- 21: 3
- 15: 2
- 2: 2
- 7: 2
- 9: 2
- 5: 3
- 10: 2
- 8: 3
- 12: 3
- 22: 3
- 20: 2

Total scores: 12 entries.

Sum = 3+3+2+2+2+2+3+2+3+3+3+2 = Let's add step by step:

3 (16) +3 (21)=6; +2 (15)=8; +2 (2)=10; +2 (7)=12; +2 (9)=14; +3 (5)=17; +2 (10)=19; +3 (8)=22; +3 (12)=25; +3 (22)=28; +2 (20)=30.

Sum is 30. Average = 30 / 12 = 2.5.

So, the average is 2.5. Therefore, 'Background (history)' must be below 2.5, which means scores of 2 or lower. But since the scores are integers (0,1,2,3), below average would be scores less than 2.5, i.e., 2 or lower. Wait, 2.5 is the average. So scores below 2.5 are 0,1,2. But looking at the data, the possible scores here are 2 and 3. Wait, the data shows that all 'Background (history)' scores are 2 or 3 except Respondent 20's examination, which is -1, but that's a different field. Wait, no, in the data, for 'Background (history)', all respondents have scores of 2 or 3. Let me check again:

Looking at each respondent's 'Background (history)':

- 16:3
- 21:3
- 15:2
- 2:2
- 7:2
- 9:2
- 5:3
- 10:2
- 8:3
- 12:3
- 22:3
- 20:2

Yes, all are either 2 or 3. So the average is 2.5. Therefore, scores below average are 2. So any respondent with 'Background (history)' of 2 would be below average.

Now, check the two candidates (21 and 12) for their 'Background (history)' scores:

- **Respondent 21:** Background (history) is 3. 3 is above 2.5, so this doesn't meet the criteria.
- **Respondent 12:** Background (history) is 3. Also above 2.5. So neither of them qualify.

Wait, that can't be right. The task says to list those who scored perfectly on both recommendations and have history below average. But according to this, none of the respondents with perfect recommendations have history below average. But maybe I made a mistake in calculating the average or in filtering.

Wait, let me recheck the average calculation. The sum is 30, divided by 12 respondents: 30/12=2.5. Correct. So the average is 2.5. Therefore, any score below 2.5 is 2 or lower. But all the 'Background (history)' scores are either 2 or 3. So 2 is below average, 3 is above. 

Now, the two respondents with perfect recommendations (21 and 12) both have history scores of 3, which is above average. Therefore, they don't meet the criteria. 

But wait, maybe I missed other respondents who have both recommendations at 3. Let me check again.

Looking back:

- **Respondent 21:** Global 3, Clear 3 → yes.
- **Respondent 12:** Global 3, Clear 3 → yes.
- Any others?

Looking through the list again:

- **Respondent 5:** Clear recommendation is 2, so no.
- **Respondent 22:** Clear recommendation is 2.
- **Respondent 8:** Clear is 2.
- **Respondent 16:** Clear is 2.
- **Respondent 9:** Clear is 3, but Global is 2. So no.

So only 21 and 12 have both recommendations at 3, but their history is 3, which is above average. Therefore, there are no respondents who meet all three criteria. But the answer can't be zero because the example had an answer. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial filtering.

Wait, let me check the data again for any other respondents with both recommendations at 3. 

Looking at each respondent:

- **Respondent 21:**
  - Recommendation (clear recommendation): 3
  - Recommendation (global rating scale): 3

- **Respondent 12:**
  - Both 3.

- **Any others?**

Looking through all:

- **Respondent 5:**
  - Clear: 2, Global:3 → No.

- **Respondent 8:**
  - Clear:2, Global:3 → No.

- **Respondent 22:**
  - Clear:2, Global:3 → No.

- **Respondent 20:**
  - Clear:2, Global:3 → No.

So only 21 and 12. Both have history 3, which is above average. Therefore, no one meets all three criteria. But the example answer was 15, but that was for a different question. Wait, the current task is different. The example was about a different query. So perhaps in this case, the answer is that there are no respondents. But maybe I made a mistake in calculating the average.

Wait, let me recheck the sum of 'Background (history)' scores. The list is:

3,3,2,2,2,2,3,2,3,3,3,2. Let's count:

3 occurs: 3 (16),3 (21),3 (5),3 (8),3 (12),3 (22) → 6 times. 6*3=18.

2 occurs: 15,2,7,9,10,20 → 6 times. 6*2=12.

Total sum: 18+12=30. 30/12=2.5. Correct.

So average is 2.5. Therefore, any score below 2.5 is 2 or lower. But all the respondents with both recommendations at 3 have history scores of 3, which is above average. Therefore, the answer is that there are no respondents meeting all criteria. But the task says to list them, so maybe the answer is none. However, perhaps I missed a respondent.

Wait, let me check again. Are there any other respondents with both recommendations at 3?

Wait, Respondent 21: yes. Respondent 12: yes. Any others?

Wait, Respondent 2: Clear recommendation is 2. Respondent 7: 2. Respondent 9: 3 in clear but global is 2. So no. 

So no one else. Therefore, the answer is that there are no respondents. But maybe I made a mistake in the average calculation. Let me check again. The average is 2.5. So a score of 2 is below average. Are there any respondents with both recommendations at 3 and history below 2.5 (i.e., history score 2 or lower)?

Looking at the two candidates (21 and 12), their history is 3. So no. Are there any other respondents with both recommendations at 3 but history 2?

Wait, let's check all respondents again for both recommendations at 3:

- Respondent 21: Clear 3, Global 3 → history 3.

- Respondent 12: Clear 3, Global 3 → history 3.

No others. So no one with both 3s in recommendations and history below 2.5. Therefore, the answer is that there are no such respondents. But the output format says to provide a list, so maybe the answer is an empty list. However, perhaps I made a mistake in the criteria.

Wait, the task says ""Background (history) is below the average for all sessions"". So the average is 2.5. Therefore, any score less than 2.5. Since the scores are integers, that would be 2 or lower. But in the data, the lowest score for history is 2. Wait, looking at the data:

Looking at all 'Background (history)' entries:

- All are 2 or 3. So the possible scores are 2 and 3. Therefore, the only score below 2.5 is 2. So any respondent with history 2 and both recommendations at 3 would qualify. But are there any such respondents?

Looking for respondents with:

- Recommendation (global rating scale): 3

- Recommendation (clear recommendation): 3

- Background (history): 2

Looking through the list:

- Respondent 21: history 3 → no.

- Respondent 12: history 3 → no.

- Any others with both recommendations at 3 and history 2?

Looking through all:

- Respondent 9: Clear 3, Global 2 → no.

- Respondent 5: Clear 2, Global 3 → no.

- Respondent 8: Clear 2, Global 3 → no.

- Respondent 22: Clear 2, Global 3 → no.

- Respondent 20: Clear 2, Global 3 → no.

So no one. Therefore, the answer is that there are no respondents meeting all three criteria. But the output format requires a list. If there are none, perhaps the answer is an empty list. But the example had an answer, but that was a different question. So in this case, the correct answer is that there are no respondents, so the output is empty. But the user might expect a list. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I missed a respondent. Let me go through each respondent again:

**Respondent 21:**
- Date: 2025-05-16
- SessionName: I (Myocardial infarction)
- Identification: 3
- Situation: 2
- Background (history): 3
- Background (examination): 1
- Assessment: 2
- Recommendation (clear recommendation): 3
- Recommendation (global rating scale): 3
- Comments: Diagnostic clarity is present...

**Respondent 12:**
- Date: 2025-05-02
- SessionName: II (Anaphylaxis)
- Identification: 3
- Situation: 3
- Background (history): 3
- Background (examination): 3
- Assessment: 2
- Recommendation (clear recommendation): 3
- Recommendation (global rating scale): 3
- Comments: Good

No others. So both have history 3, which is above average. Therefore, no one qualifies. So the answer is that there are no respondents meeting all criteria. But the output format says to provide a list. If there are none, perhaps the answer is an empty string or ""None"". But according to the output rules, for a list, it should be a comma-separated list. If none, maybe just leave it blank. But the example answer was ""15"" for a different question. 

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check the average again. Sum is 30, 12 respondents, 30/12=2.5. Correct. So history must be <2.5, which is 2. So any respondent with history 2 and both recommendations at 3. But are there any such respondents?

Looking for respondents with:

- Clear recommendation: 3

- Global rating: 3

- History: 2

Looking through all:

- Respondent 9: Clear 3, Global 2 → no.

- Respondent 21: Clear 3, Global 3, History 3 → no.

- Respondent 12: Clear 3, Global 3, History 3 → no.

- Any others with Clear 3 and Global 3? No.

So no one. Therefore, the answer is that there are no respondents. But the output requires a list. So the answer is an empty list. But how to represent that? According to the output rules, if it's a list, provide a comma-separated list. If none, perhaps just leave it as an empty string. But maybe I missed something. Let me check once more.

Wait, perhaps the average calculation is wrong. Let me recount the sum:

Respondent 16:3

21:3

15:2

2:2

7:2

9:2

5:3

10:2

8:3

12:3

22:3

20:2

Total: 3+3=6, +2=8, +2=10, +2=12, +2=14, +3=17, +2=19, +3=22, +3=25, +3=28, +2=30. Yes, sum 30. 30/12=2.5. Correct.

So, no respondents meet all three criteria. Therefore, the answer is none. But the output format requires a list. So the answer is an empty string. But according to the output rules, if the question asks for a list, provide a simple comma-separated list. If there are none, perhaps the answer is ""None"" or just empty. But the example answer was ""15"" for a different question, which was a single number. In this case, since there are no respondents, the answer is empty. But maybe I should check again if there's any respondent I missed.

Wait, let's check Respondent 5:

- Date: 2025-05-04

- SessionName: II - Anaphylaxsis

- Identification:3

- Situation:3

- Background (history):3

- Background (examination):3

- Assessment:3

- Recommendation (clear recommendation):2

- Recommendation (global rating scale):3

So, clear recommendation is 2, so doesn't meet.

Respondent 8:

- Clear recommendation:2, so no.

Respondent 22: Clear 2.

So, no. Therefore, the answer is that there are no respondents meeting all criteria. So the final answer is an empty list. But according to the output rules, if it's a list, provide a comma-separated list. If there are none, perhaps the answer is just an empty string. But maybe the user expects ""None"" or ""No respondents"". However, the example answer was a number. But in this case, since there are none, the answer is empty. But I need to follow the output rules strictly. The output rules say: ""If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"")."" So if there are none, the answer is an empty string. But perhaps the correct answer is that there are no such respondents, so the answer is empty. But I need to confirm.

The task requires listing respondents who scored 3 in both 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and have a 'Background (history)' score below the average of all sessions. 

1. **Perfect Scores in Recommendations**:
   - **Respondent 21** and **Respondent 12** scored 3 in both recommendation fields.

2. **Average for Background (history)**:
   - Total sum of scores: 30 (from 12 respondents).
   - Average: 30 / 12 = **2.5**.
   - Scores below 2.5 are **≤2**.

3. **Check Eligibility**:
   - **Respondent 21**: Background (history) = 3 (above average).
   - **Respondent 12**: Background (history) = 3 (above average).

No respondents meet all criteria.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'Background (history)' is higher than the average 'Background (history)' for all sessions on the same date.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find all respondents whose 'Background (history)' score is higher than the average 'Background (history)' for all sessions on the same date. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The 'Background (history)' is a rubric-based score ranging from 0 to 3. Each respondent has a date and a score for this category. 

The approach should be:
1. For each respondent, determine their 'Background (history)' score.
2. Calculate the average 'Background (history)' score for all sessions that occurred on the same date as the respondent's session.
3. Compare the respondent's score to this average. If their score is higher, include them in the result.

Let's start by listing all respondents with their dates and 'Background (history)' scores:

- Respondent 21: 2025-05-16, score 3
- Respondent 20: 2025-05-02, score 2
- Respondent 8: 2025-05-02, score 3
- Respondent 6: 2025-04-04, score 3
- Respondent 10: 2025-03-14, score 2
- Respondent 18: 2025-05-04, score 2
- Respondent 1: 2025-05-02, score 2
- Respondent 14: 2025-03-14, score 2

Next, for each date present, calculate the average 'Background (history)' score:

1. **2025-05-16**: Only Respondent 21. Average = 3. So Respondent 21's score (3) equals the average, so not higher. Exclude.

2. **2025-05-02**: Respondents 20, 8, and 1. Their scores are 2, 3, 2. Sum is 7, average is 7/3 ≈ 2.33. 
   - Respondent 20: 2 < 2.33 → Exclude
   - Respondent 8: 3 > 2.33 → Include
   - Respondent 1: 2 < 2.33 → Exclude

3. **2025-04-04**: Only Respondent 6. Average = 3. Score is 3 → Exclude.

4. **2025-03-14**: Respondents 10 and 14. Scores 2 and 2. Average = 2. Both scores equal average → Exclude both.

5. **2025-05-04**: Only Respondent 18. Score 2. Average is 2 → Exclude.

So the only respondent whose 'Background (history)' score is higher than the average for their session date is Respondent 8.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents who scored perfectly on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 'Situation' and whose 'Identification' is below the average for all sessions.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to list all respondents who scored perfectly on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 'Situation' and whose 'Identification' is below the average for all sessions. 

First, I need to understand the criteria. 

1. **Perfect scores on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 'Situation':** 
   - The rubric for 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' says a 3 means ""Confident and required little or no questioning."" So a perfect score here is 3.
   - For 'Situation', a score of 3 means ""Identifies and prioritizes the main problem(s) unprompted."" So again, a perfect score is 3.

2. **'Identification' below the average for all sessions:**
   - First, I need to calculate the average Identification score across all respondents. Then, find those respondents whose Identification score is below that average.

Let's start by going through each respondent and check their scores for the two criteria. Then compute the average Identification score.

Looking at the data:

**Respondent 8:**
- Date: 2025-05-02
- Situation: 3
- Recommendation (global rating scale): 3
- Identification: 3

**Respondent 4:**
- Situation: 3
- Recommendation (global rating scale): 2
- Identification: 3

**Respondent 15:**
- Situation: 3
- Recommendation (global rating scale): 2
- Identification: 3

**Respondent 22:**
- Situation: 3
- Recommendation (global rating scale): 3
- Identification: 3

**Respondent 5:**
- Situation: 3
- Recommendation (global rating scale): 3
- Identification: 3

**Respondent 16:**
- Situation: 3
- Recommendation (global rating scale): 3
- Identification: 3

**Respondent 10:**
- Situation: 2
- Recommendation (global rating scale): 2
- Identification: 2

**Respondent 9:**
- Situation: 3
- Recommendation (global rating scale): 2
- Identification: 3

Now, first filter those who have both 'Situation' and 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' as 3. Let's see:

- Respondent 8: Yes (3 and 3)
- Respondent 22: Yes (3 and 3)
- Respondent 5: Yes (3 and 3)
- Respondent 16: Yes (3 and 3)
- Others: No

So the candidates are 8, 22, 5, 16.

Next, calculate the average Identification score across all sessions. Let's list all Identification scores:

Respondent 8: 3
Respondent 4: 3
Respondent 15: 3
Respondent 22: 3
Respondent 5: 3
Respondent 16: 3
Respondent 10: 2
Respondent 9: 3

Total respondents: 8

Sum of Identification scores: 3+3+3+3+3+3+2+3 = 23

Average = 23 / 8 = 2.875

So the average Identification score is 2.875. We need respondents whose Identification is below this average. Since the scores are integers (0,1,2,3), a score below 2.875 would be 2 or lower.

Looking at the candidates (8,22,5,16), all have Identification 3, which is above the average. Wait, but the average is 2.875, so 3 is above. Therefore, none of the candidates meet the second condition. 

But wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again. The task says ""whose 'Identification' is below the average for all sessions."" So the average is 2.875. So any Identification score less than 2.875 would be 2 or lower. But all the candidates have Identification 3, which is above average. Therefore, there are no respondents who meet all three criteria. 

But wait, let me check if I missed any respondents. Let me go through each again.

Wait, Respondent 10 has Identification 2. But their 'Situation' is 2 and 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is 2, so they don't meet the first criteria. 

So, the conclusion is that there are no respondents who scored perfectly on both 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 'Situation' and have an Identification score below the average. 

But wait, maybe I miscalculated the average. Let me recalculate:

Total Identification scores: 3 (8) +3 (4)+3 (15)+3 (22)+3 (5)+3 (16)+2 (10)+3 (9) = 3*7 +2 = 23. 23 divided by 8 is 2.875. Correct.

So the answer is that there are no such respondents. But the example given in the problem had an answer, but that was a different question. Wait, the example's answer was 15, but in this case, the task is different. 

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the initial filtering. Let me check again.

Wait, the task is to list respondents who:

1. Scored perfectly on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' (3) and 'Situation' (3)
2. And their 'Identification' is below the average for all sessions.

So first, filter those with Situation=3 and GRS=3. Then check if their Identification is below average (2.875). Since all of them have Identification=3, which is above 2.875, none qualify. Therefore, the answer is that there are no respondents meeting all criteria. But the output format says to provide a list, so maybe the answer is an empty list. But according to the output rules, if it's a list, provide a comma-separated list. If there are none, perhaps the answer is ""None"" or an empty string. But the example answer was ""15"" for a different question, but in this case, perhaps the answer is no one. 

Wait, but let me check again. Maybe I missed a respondent. Let me go through each respondent again:

Respondent 8: GRS=3, Situation=3, Identification=3 → meets first two, but Identification is 3 (above average)
Respondent 22: same as above
Respondent 5: same
Respondent 16: same

No one else. So the answer is that there are no respondents. But the output format says to provide a list. If the answer is none, perhaps the answer is an empty string. But maybe I made a mistake in the average calculation. Let me check again.

Total Identification scores: 3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3 → sum is 23, average 23/8=2.875. Correct. So any Identification score below 2.875 is 2 or lower. But none of the candidates have that. So the answer is that there are no respondents meeting all criteria. Therefore, the answer is an empty list. But according to the output rules, if the task is to list, then output a comma-separated list. If there are none, perhaps just leave it blank. But maybe I made a mistake in the criteria. Let me check the task again.

Wait, the task says ""Identification is below the average for all sessions"". So the average is 2.875. So any Identification score less than 2.875. Since Identification is an integer, possible scores are 0,1,2,3. So scores 0,1,2 are below 2.875. But all the respondents who have Situation and GRS as 3 have Identification 3. Therefore, none qualify. So the answer is that there are no such respondents. Therefore, the answer is an empty list. But the output format requires a list. So the answer is nothing, but how to represent that? Maybe just ""None"" or leave it blank. But according to the output rules, if it's a list, provide a simple comma-separated list. If there are none, perhaps the answer is an empty string. But the example answer was ""15"" which was a single number. But in this case, since there are none, perhaps the answer is ""None"" or just leave it blank. However, the output rules say to provide the answer directly. Maybe the correct answer is that there are no respondents, so the answer is an empty string. But I need to confirm.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondents participated in a session where the average 'Background (examination)' for that session name is greater than 2.0?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find which respondents participated in a session where the average 'Background (examination)' score for that session name is greater than 2.0. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The data has multiple respondents, each with a SessionName and a Background (examination) score. The goal is to group respondents by their SessionName, calculate the average of Background (examination) for each group, and then find which respondents are in sessions where this average is above 2.0.

Let me start by listing all the respondents along with their SessionName and Background (examination) scores:

- Respondent 16: SessionName ""I - MI"", Background (examination) 3
- Respondent 23: SessionName ""II-Anaphylaxsis"", Background (examination) 2
- Respondent 8: SessionName ""III (Sepsis)"", Background (examination) 2
- Respondent 15: SessionName ""III - Sepsis"", Background (examination) 3
- Respondent 18: SessionName ""IV - VT"", Background (examination) 2
- Respondent 5: SessionName ""II - Anaphylaxsis"", Background (examination) 3
- Respondent 13: SessionName ""I-VF"", Background (examination) 1
- Respondent 7: SessionName ""III-Sepsis"", Background (examination) 3
- Respondent 20: SessionName ""IV (VT)"", Background (examination) -1
- Respondent 10: SessionName ""(MI)-VT"", Background (examination) 2
- Respondent 9: SessionName ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"", Background (examination) 2

Next, I need to group these by SessionName. However, I notice that some SessionNames might be variations of the same name. For example, ""III (Sepsis)"", ""III - Sepsis"", and ""III-Sepsis"" could be considered the same session name. Similarly, ""II-Anaphylaxsis"", ""II - Anaphylaxsis"", and ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"" might be the same. Let me check if these are different sessions or just different formatting.

Looking at the SessionNames:

- ""I - MI"" (Respondent 16)
- ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" (Respondent 23)
- ""III (Sepsis)"" (Respondent 8)
- ""III - Sepsis"" (Respondent 15)
- ""IV - VT"" (Respondent 18)
- ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" (Respondent 5)
- ""I-VF"" (Respondent 13)
- ""III-Sepsis"" (Respondent 7)
- ""IV (VT)"" (Respondent 20)
- ""(MI)-VT"" (Respondent 10)
- ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"" (Respondent 9)

It seems like the variations in punctuation and spacing (like hyphens, parentheses, spaces) might be different ways of writing the same session. For example, ""III (Sepsis)"", ""III - Sepsis"", and ""III-Sepsis"" all refer to Sepsis in session III. Similarly, ""II-Anaphylaxsis"", ""II - Anaphylaxsis"", and ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"" are all Anaphylaxis in session II. The same applies to ""IV - VT"" and ""IV (VT)"" for VT in session IV. However, ""I - MI"" and ""(MI)-VT"" might be different sessions. Let's confirm:

- Session I: ""I - MI"" (Respondent 16) and ""I-VF"" (Respondent 13) are different (MI vs VF).
- Session II: ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" (23), ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" (5), ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"" (9) – all Anaphylaxis.
- Session III: ""III (Sepsis)"" (8), ""III - Sepsis"" (15), ""III-Sepsis"" (7) – all Sepsis.
- Session IV: ""IV - VT"" (18), ""IV (VT)"" (20) – both VT.
- Others: ""(MI)-VT"" (10) might be a different session combining MI and VT.

So, grouping by the core session name (ignoring formatting):

- Session I-MI: Respondent 16
- Session I-VF: Respondent 13
- Session II-Anaphylaxsis: Respondents 23, 5, 9
- Session III-Sepsis: Respondents 8, 15, 7
- Session IV-VT: Respondents 18, 20
- Session (MI)-VT: Respondent 10

Now, calculate the average Background (examination) for each session:

1. Session I-MI: Only Respondent 16 with score 3. Average = 3.0
2. Session I-VF: Respondent 13 with score 1. Average = 1.0
3. Session II-Anaphylaxsis: Respondents 23 (2), 5 (3), 9 (2). Sum = 2+3+2=7. Average = 7/3 ≈ 2.33
4. Session III-Sepsis: Respondents 8 (2), 15 (3), 7 (3). Sum = 2+3+3=8. Average = 8/3 ≈ 2.67
5. Session IV-VT: Respondents 18 (2), 20 (-1). Sum = 2 + (-1) =1. Average = 1/2 = 0.5
6. Session (MI)-VT: Respondent 10 with score 2. Average = 2.0

Now, the question asks for sessions where the average is greater than 2.0. Let's check which sessions meet this:

- Session I-MI: 3.0 > 2.0 → Yes
- Session II-Anaphylaxsis: 2.33 > 2.0 → Yes
- Session III-Sepsis: 2.67 > 2.0 → Yes
- Others: No

Now, list all respondents in these sessions:

- Session I-MI: Respondent 16
- Session II-Anaphylaxsis: Respondents 23, 5, 9
- Session III-Sepsis: Respondents 8, 15, 7

So the respondents are 16, 23, 5, 9, 8, 15, 7.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations:

For Session II-Anaphylaxsis: 23 (2), 5 (3), 9 (2). Sum 7, average 7/3 ≈ 2.33. Correct.

Session III-Sepsis: 8 (2), 15 (3), 7 (3). Sum 8, average 8/3 ≈ 2.67. Correct.

Session I-MI: 3.0. Correct.

So the respondents in these sessions are:

16, 23, 5, 9, 8, 15, 7.

But wait, the answer in the example was 15. However, in the example, the question was different. The current task is different. Let me make sure I'm not mixing up tasks.

Wait, the example's answer was 15, but that was for a different question (respondents on 2025-05-04 with Situation score 3). The current task is different. So proceeding.

So the final list of respondents is 16,23,5,9,8,15,7. Let me check if all these are correct.

But wait, the Session III-Sepsis includes respondents 8,15,7. Let's check their SessionNames:

- Respondent 8: III (Sepsis)
- Respondent 15: III - Sepsis
- Respondent 7: III-Sepsis

Yes, all part of Session III-Sepsis.

Similarly, Session II-Anaphylaxsis includes 23,5,9:

- 23: II-Anaphylaxsis
- 5: II - Anaphylaxsis
- 9: II (Anaphylaxsis)

Yes.

Session I-MI: 16.

So the respondents are 16,23,5,9,8,15,7.

But wait, the task says ""average 'Background (examination)' for that session name is greater than 2.0"". So sessions with average >2.0 are I-MI (3.0), II-Anaphylaxsis (2.33), III-Sepsis (2.67). So the respondents in these sessions are 16,23,5,9,8,15,7.

But let me check each respondent's Background (examination) again to ensure no mistakes.

Respondent 16: 3 → correct.

Respondent 23: 2 → part of II-Anaphylaxsis (average 2.33)

Respondent 5: 3 → part of II-Anaphylaxsis

Respondent 9: 2 → part of II-Anaphylaxsis

Respondent 8: 2 → part of III-Sepsis (average 2.67)

Respondent 15: 3 → part of III-Sepsis

Respondent 7: 3 → part of III-Sepsis

Yes, all correct.

So the answer should be these respondents: 16,23,5,9,8,15,7. But let me check if the problem requires the list in any particular order. The output format says a simple comma-separated list. So the answer is 16,23,5,9,8,15,7.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'Background (history)' is higher than the average 'Background (history)' for all sessions on the same date.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find all respondents whose 'Background (history)' score is higher than the average 'Background (history)' for all sessions on the same date. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The data provided includes multiple respondents, each with a Date, SessionName, and various scores including 'Background (history)'. The 'Background (history)' is scored on a rubric from 0 to 3. 

The approach here is to calculate the average 'Background (history)' score for each date, then compare each respondent's score against the average of their respective date. If their score is higher than the average, they should be included in the result.

Let me start by listing all the respondents along with their dates and 'Background (history)' scores:

- Respondent 3: Date 2025-04-04, Score 3
- Respondent 9: Date 2025-05-04, Score 2
- Respondent 14: Date 2025-03-14, Score 2
- Respondent 11: Date 2025-04-04, Score 3
- Respondent 17: Date 2025-05-04, Score 3
- Respondent 22: Date 2025-05-16, Score 3
- Respondent 1: Date 2025-05-02, Score 2
- Respondent 10: Date 2025-03-14, Score 2
- Respondent 12: Date 2025-05-02, Score 3

Now, group the respondents by date and calculate the average for each group:

1. **2025-03-14**: Respondents 14 and 10. Scores are 2 and 2. Average = (2 + 2)/2 = 2.0
2. **2025-04-04**: Respondents 3 and 11. Scores are 3 and 3. Average = (3 + 3)/2 = 3.0
3. **2025-05-02**: Respondents 1 and 12. Scores are 2 and 3. Average = (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5
4. **2025-05-04**: Respondents 9 and 17. Scores are 2 and 3. Average = (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5
5. **2025-05-16**: Respondent 22. Score 3. Average = 3.0

Now, compare each respondent's score to their date's average:

- **Respondent 3 (2025-04-04, 3)**: 3 vs 3.0 → Equal, not higher. Exclude.
- **Respondent 9 (2025-05-04, 2)**: 2 vs 2.5 → Lower. Exclude.
- **Respondent 14 (2025-03-14, 2)**: 2 vs 2.0 → Equal. Exclude.
- **Respondent 11 (2025-04-04, 3)**: 3 vs 3.0 → Equal. Exclude.
- **Respondent 17 (2025-05-04, 3)**: 3 vs 2.5 → Higher. Include.
- **Respondent 22 (2025-05-16, 3)**: 3 vs 3.0 → Equal. Exclude.
- **Respondent 1 (2025-05-02, 2)**: 2 vs 2.5 → Lower. Exclude.
- **Respondent 10 (2025-03-14, 2)**: 2 vs 2.0 → Equal. Exclude.
- **Respondent 12 (2025-05-02, 3)**: 3 vs 2.5 → Higher. Include.

So, the respondents who meet the criteria are Respondent 17 and Respondent 12. Their scores are higher than the average of their respective dates. 

Wait, let me double-check the calculations. For 2025-05-02, the average is 2.5. Respondent 12 has a score of 3, which is higher. Correct. For 2025-05-04, average is 2.5, Respondent 17 has 3. Correct. 

No other respondents have scores higher than their date's average. Therefore, the answer should be Respondents 12 and 17.
