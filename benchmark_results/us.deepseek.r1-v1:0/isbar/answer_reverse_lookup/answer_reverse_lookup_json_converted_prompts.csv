You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
List all respondents from sessions on '2025-05-02' who scored 3 on 'Background (examination)'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to list all respondents from sessions on '2025-05-02' who scored 3 on 'Background (examination)'. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The dataset has a 'responses' array where each entry represents a respondent. Each respondent has an 'answers' object containing various fields, including 'Date' and 'Background (examination)'. 

The first step is to filter the responses where the 'Date' is exactly '2025-05-02'. Then, among those, I need to check if their 'Background (examination)' score is 3. 

Looking at the 'responses' array:

1. Respondent 8: Date is '2025-05-02', 'Background (examination)' is 2.
2. Respondent 1: Date is '2025-05-02', 'Background (examination)' is 2.
3. Respondent 20: Date is '2025-05-02', 'Background (examination)' is -1.

None of these respondents have a score of 3 in 'Background (examination)' on that date. Therefore, there are no respondents meeting both criteria.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Find all respondents from the 'III (Sepsis)' session who scored 2 on 'Assessment' and 3 on 'Situation'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The goal is to find all respondents from the 'III (Sepsis)' session who scored 2 on 'Assessment' and 3 on 'Situation'. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The dataset has a 'responses' array where each entry is a respondent with their answers. Each answer includes various fields like Date, SessionName, and scores for different categories.

The task specifies three criteria:
1. SessionName must be 'III (Sepsis)'.
2. 'Assessment' score must be 2.
3. 'Situation' score must be 3.

I'll start by going through each respondent in the 'responses' array and check these three conditions.

Looking at the first respondent, respondent 18: Their SessionName is ""IV - VT"", which doesn't match. So skip.

Respondent 11: SessionName is ""IV (AF)"", not matching. Skip.

Respondent 12: SessionName is ""II (Anaphylaxis)"", nope.

Respondent 15: SessionName is ""III - Sepsis"". Hmm, the task says 'III (Sepsis)', but this has a hyphen instead of parentheses. Wait, the exact match is important. Let me check the data again. The example in the data shows some variations, like ""III - Sepsis"" and ""III (Sepsis)"". The task specifies 'III (Sepsis)', so I need to check if the SessionName exactly matches that. However, in the data, there's a respondent 8 with SessionName ""III (Sepsis)"" and respondent 4 also has ""III (Sepsis)"". Respondent 15's SessionName is ""III - Sepsis"", which uses a hyphen. So maybe the task is looking for any variation of III and Sepsis, but the exact string is important. Wait, the task says 'III (Sepsis)', so I should look for that exact string. So respondent 15's SessionName is ""III - Sepsis"" which is different. So they might not be included. But maybe the hyphen vs parentheses is a typo? The task uses parentheses, so I should stick to that.

Moving on. Respondent 9: SessionName is ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"", no. Respondent 10: ""(MI)-VT"", nope. Respondent 19: ""I - MI"", no. Respondent 8: SessionName is ""III (Sepsis)"". Let's check their scores. Their 'Assessment' is 2, 'Situation' is 3. So this one meets all criteria. 

Next, respondent 2: SessionName is ""MI"", no. Respondent 21: ""I (Myocardial infarction)"", no. Respondent 4: SessionName is ""III (Sepsis)"". Check their scores: 'Assessment' is 2, 'Situation' is 3. So this is another match.

Wait, let me verify each of these. 

Respondent 8:
- SessionName: ""III (Sepsis)""
- Situation: 3
- Assessment: 2
Yes, meets all.

Respondent 4:
- SessionName: ""III (Sepsis)""
- Situation: 3
- Assessment: 2
Yes, also meets.

Are there any others? Let's check all responses again.

Looking at respondent 4's data again: Yes, their answers show Assessment 2 and Situation 3. SessionName is ""III (Sepsis)"".

What about respondent 15? Their SessionName is ""III - Sepsis"", which is different from ""III (Sepsis)"", so they are excluded. Similarly, respondent 8's SessionName is ""III (Sepsis)"", which matches exactly. 

So the respondents that meet all three criteria are 8 and 4. Wait, wait, looking back at the data:

Wait, the responses list includes:

Looking at the data provided in the questionnaire:

Looking at the 'responses' array:

- Respondent 8:
  ""SessionName"": ""III (Sepsis)"",
  ""Situation"": 3,
  ""Assessment"": 2

- Respondent 4:
  ""SessionName"": ""III (Sepsis)"",
  ""Situation"": 3,
  ""Assessment"": 2

Yes, both of these have the correct SessionName, and the required scores. Are there any others?

Another check: Respondent 15's SessionName is ""III - Sepsis"", which is not exactly ""III (Sepsis)"", so they are excluded. 

So the answer should be respondents 8 and 4. But wait, the example given in the problem had an answer of 15, which was correct for that example's criteria. But in this case, the correct respondents are 8 and 4. Let me confirm once more.

Looking through all responses:

Respondent 8: SessionName ""III (Sepsis)"", Situation 3, Assessment 2. Yes.

Respondent 4: SessionName ""III (Sepsis)"", Situation 3, Assessment 2. Yes.

No other respondents have SessionName exactly ""III (Sepsis)"" and the required scores. So the answer should be respondents 8 and 4. But wait, the task says ""III (Sepsis)"", and in the data, respondent 4's SessionName is ""III (Sepsis)"", correct. Respondent 8's SessionName is ""III (Sepsis)"" as well. So both 8 and 4. But wait, looking back at the data:

Wait, in the data provided, the responses for respondent 8 are:

    {
      ""respondent"": ""8"",
      ""answers"": {
        ""Date"": ""2025-05-02"",
        ""SessionName"": ""III (Sepsis)"",
        ""Identification"": 3,
        ""Situation"": 3,
        ""Background (history)"": 3,
        ""Background (examination)"": 2,
        ""Assessment"": 2,
        ""Recommendation (clear recommendation)"": 2,
        ""Recommendation (global rating scale)"": 3,
        ""Comments"": ""Clear communication during handover\nGood""
      }
    },

And respondent 4:

    {
      ""respondent"": ""4"",
      ""answers"": {
        ""Date"": ""2025-05-16"",
        ""SessionName"": ""III (Sepsis)"",
        ""Identification"": 3,
        ""Situation"": 3,
        ""Background (history)"": 3,
        ""Background (examination)"": 2,
        ""Assessment"": 2,
        ""Recommendation (clear recommendation)"": 2,
        ""Recommendation (global rating scale)"": 2,
        ""Comments"": ""Clinical handover and communication skills, satisfactory\nNo panic, no arrest team\nSatisfactory""
      }
    },

Yes, both have SessionName ""III (Sepsis)"", Situation 3, Assessment 2. So the answer should be respondents 8 and 4. Therefore, the list is ""8, 4"".

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondents have a total score for 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' greater than 5?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find which respondents have a total score for 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' greater than 5. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The responses array contains each respondent's answers. Each answer includes various fields, including the two in question: 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)'. 

The goal is to sum these two scores for each respondent and check if the sum is greater than 5. Let's go through each respondent one by one.

Starting with respondent 21: 
- 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' is 3.
- 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is 3.
Sum is 3 + 3 = 6. That's greater than 5, so 21 qualifies.

Respondent 22:
- Clear recommendation: 2
- Global rating: 3
Sum is 5. Not greater than 5. So no.

Respondent 2:
- Clear: 2
- Global: 1
Sum 3. No.

Respondent 5:
- Clear: 2
- Global: 3
Sum 5. No.

Respondent 20:
- Clear: 2
- Global: 3
Sum 5. No.

Respondent 10:
- Both are 2. Sum 4. No.

Respondent 3:
- Clear: 3
- Global: 3
Sum 6. So 3 is included.

Respondent 8:
- Both are 2. Sum 4. No.

Respondent 23:
- Clear: 3
- Global: 3
Sum 6. So 23 is in.

Respondent 9:
- Clear: 3
- Global: 2
Sum 5. No.

Respondent 13:
- Both 2. Sum 4. No.

Respondent 7:
- Both 2. Sum 4. No.

So the respondents with sums greater than 5 are 21, 3, and 23. Let me double-check each to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

21: 3+3=6 ✅
3: 3+3=6 ✅
23: 3+3=6 ✅

Yes, those three. The answer should be their respondent IDs: 21, 3, 23.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents who scored 3 on 'Identification' and whose 'Comments' contain the word 'Overall'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The goal is to find all respondents who scored 3 on 'Identification' and have the word 'Overall' in their 'Comments'. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The 'questions' section defines each field. The 'Identification' field uses a rubric where 3 means ""Introduces themselves and information is complete"". The 'Comments' field is an open-ended text.

Now, looking at the 'responses' array, I need to iterate through each respondent. For each one, check two conditions: 
1. Their 'Identification' score is exactly 3.
2. Their 'Comments' field contains the word 'Overall' (case-sensitive as per the output rules).

Starting with respondent 20: Identification is 3, but Comments are ""Good"" – no 'Overall' here. Next, respondent 23: Comments mention ""DID: Sepsis I Anaphylaxsis..."" – no 'Overall'. Respondent 8: Comments are ""Clear communication... Good"" – no. Respondent 17: Comments say ""Concise - clear... Satisfactory"" – nope. Respondent 13: Comments include ""Lack of communication..."" – not there. 

Respondent 15: Comments are ""Detailed Response - clear communication"" – no 'Overall'. Respondent 18: Comments mention ""Not very concise..."" – not here. Respondent 10: Comments just have a time – skip. Respondent 14: Comments about ""Late response..."" – no. Respondent 16: ""Consent denied..."" – nope. Respondent 7: Comments are a time again. 

Finally, respondent 5: Comments are ""Good clear and precise clinical handover\nGood"". Wait, no 'Overall' here either. Hmm, did I miss any? Let me check again. All respondents with Identification 3 and their comments. Wait, none of the comments have the word 'Overall'. So the answer should be that there are no such respondents. But wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check each comment again carefully. 

Looking at each comment field again:

- 20: ""Good""
- 23: Long comment but no 'Overall'
- 8: ""Clear communication...""
- 17: ""Concise - clear...""
- 13: Mentions ""Ventricular fibrillation...""
- 15: ""Detailed Response...""
- 18: ""Not very concise...""
- 10: Time only
- 14: ""Late response...""
- 16: ""Consent denied...""
- 7: Time only
- 5: ""Good clear and precise...""

None of these include the word 'Overall'. Therefore, there are no respondents meeting both criteria. But the example answer was 15, but in that example, the task was different. Wait, the current task is different. So the correct answer here is that there are no respondents, so the list is empty. But the output rules say if it's a list, provide a comma-separated list. If none, maybe output an empty string or state none. But according to the output rules, for a list, provide a simple comma-separated list. Since there are none, the answer should be an empty list. But maybe I missed a comment. Let me check once more. 

Wait, maybe 'Overall' is part of a larger word? Like 'Overall' in 'OverallGood'? But looking at the comments, none have that. So the answer is that there are no respondents meeting the criteria. Therefore, the answer is an empty list. But the output format says to provide the human-readable value. If the task is to list them, and there are none, perhaps the answer is ""None"" or just an empty string. However, according to the example, when there was a match, they listed the numbers. Since there are no matches here, the answer should be an empty list. But the system might expect ""None"" or similar. Wait, the example answer was ""15"" which was a number, but that was for a different task. Let me check the output rules again. 

The output rules state: ""If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., '17, 21, 23')"". Since the task is to list respondents, and there are none, the correct output would be an empty string. But maybe the system expects ""None"" or just no answer. However, according to the example, when there was a match, they provided the number. But in this case, since there are no respondents, perhaps the answer is an empty string. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check all comments again. 

Wait, respondent 5's comment is ""Good clear and precise clinical handover\nGood"". The word 'Overall' isn't present. So no matches. Therefore, the answer is that there are no respondents, so the list is empty. But how to represent that? The output rules don't specify, but in the example, they provided the correct ID. Since there are none here, the answer should be an empty list. However, maybe the user expects ""None"" or just a blank. But according to the output instructions, if it's a list, provide a comma-separated list. If there are none, perhaps leave it blank. So the final answer is an empty string. But maybe the user expects ""None"". Alternatively, perhaps I missed a comment. Let me check once more. 

No, all comments are checked. None contain 'Overall'. So the answer is that there are no respondents meeting the criteria. Therefore, the answer is an empty list. But according to the output rules, for a list, provide a comma-separated list. If there are none, perhaps the answer is just an empty string. So the final answer is nothing, but since the system requires an answer, maybe the correct output is an empty string. However, in some contexts, it's better to state ""None"". But the example didn't have that. The example answer was ""15"" which was a number. Since this task is a list, and there are none, the answer is an empty list. So the answer is: (empty)

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents who scored 1 on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and whose 'Comments' contain the word 'Clear'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The goal is to find all respondents who scored 1 on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and whose 'Comments' include the word 'Clear'. 

First, I need to understand the structure of the data provided. The dataset has a 'questions' section that defines each field and a 'responses' array with each respondent's answers. 

Looking at the 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' in the questions, the rubric says a score of 1 means ""Confident but required extended questioning"". So I need to filter all responses where this field is exactly 1.

Next, the 'Comments' field is an open-ended text. I need to check if the comment contains the word 'Clear' (case-insensitive, but the output should preserve the original case). However, the task says to look for the word 'Clear' in the comments. So I'll scan each respondent's 'Comments' field for any occurrence of 'Clear', regardless of case, but the output should show the exact text as stored.

Now, let's go through each respondent in the 'responses' array:

1. Respondent 20: 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is 3. Comments: ""Good"" – doesn't meet either condition.
2. Respondent 2: Score is 1. Comments are empty. So even though the score is 1, the comment doesn't have 'Clear' – exclude.
3. Respondent 23: Score 3. Comments mention ""could not summarize... clearly"" – but score isn't 1. Exclude.
4. Respondent 4: Score 2. Comments have ""clear communication"" but score isn't 1. Exclude.
5. Respondent 7: Score 2. Comments don't mention 'Clear'. Exclude.
6. Respondent 19: Score 3. Comments have ""Clarity"" but not 'Clear' and score isn't 1. Exclude.
7. Respondent 9: Score 2. Comments mention ""unclear"" which is the opposite. Exclude.
8. Respondent 3: Score 3. Comments have ""Clear communication"" but score isn't 1. Exclude.
9. Respondent 16: Score 3. Comments don't have 'Clear'. Exclude.
10. Respondent 21: Score 3. Comments mention ""Diagnostic clarity"" but not 'Clear' and score isn't 1. Exclude.
11. Respondent 15: Score 2. Comments have ""clear communication"" but score isn't 1. Exclude.
12. Respondent 17: Score 2. Comments have ""Concise - clear"" but score isn't 1. Exclude.

Wait, did I miss any? Let me check again. The only respondent with a score of 1 is Respondent 2. But their comments are empty. So there are no respondents who meet both criteria. Wait, but let me double-check. The task says ""scored 1 on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and whose 'Comments' contain the word 'Clear'"". 

Looking back, Respondent 2's 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is 1, but their comments are empty. So no 'Clear' there. Are there any others? Let me check again. 

Wait, maybe I missed a respondent. Let me go through each one again:

- Respondent 2: Score 1, Comments: """" → No.
- Any others with score 1? Let's check all 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' values:

Looking at each response's 'Recommendation (global rating scale)':

- 20: 3
- 2: 1
- 23:3
-4:2
-7:2
-19:3
-9:2
-3:3
-16:3
-21:3
-15:2
-17:2

Only respondent 2 has a score of 1. But their comments are empty. Therefore, there are no respondents that meet both conditions. But wait, the example given in the problem had an answer of 15, but that was for a different query. Wait, the current task is different. 

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again. The task is to find respondents who scored 1 on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and have 'Clear' in their comments. 

Looking again, the only respondent with score 1 is respondent 2, but their comments are empty. Therefore, the answer should be that there are no such respondents. But wait, maybe I missed a respondent. Let me check again. 

Wait, respondent 3's 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is 3, and their comments have ""Clear communication"". But score is 3. 

Respondent 4's comments: ""Clinical handover and communication skills, satisfactory..."" – no 'Clear'.

Respondent 15's comments: ""Detailed Response - clear communication"" – 'clear' in lowercase. But the task says to check if the comment contains the word 'Clear' (case-insensitive). So 'clear' would count. But respondent 15's score is 2, so they don't meet the score condition. 

Wait, the task says ""contain the word 'Clear'"". So case-insensitive? The output should preserve the original case, but the check is case-insensitive. So 'clear' in lowercase in the comment would still count. But the score for respondent 15 is 2, so they don't meet the score. 

So the only possible candidate is respondent 2, but their comments are empty. Therefore, there are no respondents that meet both criteria. But the example answer was 15, but that was for a different question. 

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check all 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' scores again. 

Looking at each response:

- Respondent 2: ""Recommendation (global rating scale)"": 1. Comments: """" → No 'Clear'.
- Any others? No. 

Therefore, the answer should be that there are no respondents meeting both conditions. But the system might expect a list, even if empty. However, according to the data provided, there are no respondents who scored 1 on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and have 'Clear' in their comments. 

But wait, let me check again. Maybe I missed a respondent. Let me go through each one once more:

1. Respondent 20: GRS 3, comments ""Good"" → no.
2. Respondent 2: GRS 1, comments """" → no.
3. Respondent 23: GRS 3, comments have ""clearly"" but not 'Clear' → no.
4. Respondent 4: GRS 2, comments have ""clear communication"" → but score 2.
5. Respondent 7: GRS 2, comments ""Time..."" → no.
6. Respondent 19: GRS 3, comments mention ""Clarity"" → no.
7. Respondent 9: GRS 2, comments ""unclear"" → no.
8. Respondent 3: GRS 3, comments ""Clear communication"" → score 3.
9. Respondent 16: GRS 3, comments ""Satisfactory"" → no.
10. Respondent 21: GRS 3, comments ""Diagnostic clarity"" → no.
11. Respondent 15: GRS 2, comments ""clear communication"" → score 2.
12. Respondent 17: GRS 2, comments ""Concise - clear"" → score 2.

So no one with GRS 1 and 'Clear' in comments. Therefore, the answer should be an empty list. But the output rules say if it's a list, provide a comma-separated list. If none, perhaps output nothing or ""None"". But according to the output rules, if the task asks for a list and there are none, maybe just return an empty string. However, the example had an answer of ""15"" which was a number, but that was for a different question. 

But according to the data, there are no respondents meeting both criteria. So the answer is that there are none. But let me check once more to be sure. 

Yes, only respondent 2 has GRS 1, but no 'Clear' in comments. All others with 'Clear' in comments have GRS not equal to 1. Therefore, the answer is that there are no such respondents.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents who scored 3 on 'Identification' and whose 'Comments' contain the word 'Time'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to list all respondents who scored 3 on 'Identification' and whose 'Comments' contain the word 'Time'. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The dataset has a 'questions' section which defines each field, and a 'responses' array with each respondent's data. 

Looking at the 'Identification' question, the rubric says a score of 3 means ""Introduces themselves and information is complete."" So I need to filter respondents with 'Identification' equal to 3.

Next, the 'Comments' field is an open-ended text field. The task requires that the comments contain the word 'Time'. I need to check each respondent's 'Comments' for this keyword, case-insensitive probably, but the example given in the data shows ""Time: (2:36-2:53)"" so maybe it's case-sensitive. But the output rules say to preserve capitalization, so maybe exact match isn't required. But the instruction says ""contain the word 'Time'"", so I'll look for any occurrence of 'Time' regardless of case, but in the data, the examples have 'Time' with a capital T. Let me check the responses.

Looking through the responses:

- Respondent 6: Comments is empty. No.
- Respondent 1: Comments is ""Satisfactory"". No.
- Respondent 14: Comments has ""Time: (2:36-2:53)..."". Yes, contains 'Time'.
- Respondent 15: Comments is ""Detailed Response..."". No.
- Respondent 16: Comments mentions ""Consent denied..."". No.
- Respondent 10: Comments has ""Time: (15:53-16:14)"". Yes.
- Respondent 2: Comments is empty. No.
- Respondent 8: Comments has ""Clear communication..."". No.

Now, among these, which of these respondents also have 'Identification' score 3?

Check each:

- Respondent 6: Identification is 3. But Comments is empty. So no.
- Respondent 14: Identification is 3. Comments has 'Time'. So yes.
- Respondent 10: Identification is 2. So no.
- Others with 'Time' in comments: only 14 and 10. But 10's Identification is 2, so only 14 qualifies.

Wait, let me double-check:

Looking at each response:

Respondent 14:
- ""answers"": { ""Identification"": 3, ... ""Comments"": ""Time: (2:36-2:53)\nLate..."" }
So yes, Identification 3 and Comments have 'Time'.

Respondent 10:
- ""answers"": { ""Identification"": 2, ... ""Comments"": ""Time: (15:53-16:14)"" }
Here, Identification is 2, so doesn't meet the first condition.

Any others? Let's check all responses again.

Looking at all responses:

- Respondent 6: Identification 3, Comments empty. No.
- Respondent 1: Identification -1. No.
- Respondent 14: 3 and Time. Yes.
- Respondent 15: 3, but Comments don't have Time. No.
- Respondent 16: 3, Comments no Time. No.
- Respondent 10: 2, so no.
- Respondent 2: 3, Comments empty. No.
- Respondent 8: 3, Comments no Time. No.

So the only respondent that meets both conditions is 14.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondents have a total score for 'Background (history)' and 'Background (examination)' greater than 4?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find which respondents have a total score for 'Background (history)' and 'Background (examination)' greater than 4. 

First, I need to look at each respondent's answers and calculate the sum of these two fields. Let's go through each response one by one.

Starting with respondent 23. Their Background (history) is 2 and examination is 2. Adding those gives 4. But the question is looking for scores greater than 4, so 4 doesn't count. So, 23 is out.

Next, respondent 10. Both history and examination are 2 each. Sum is 4 again. Not greater than 4. Exclude.

Respondent 15: History is 2, examination is 3. Total is 5. That's over 4. So 15 is a candidate.

Respondent 3: History is 3, examination is 3. Sum is 6. That's definitely greater than 4. So 3 is included.

Respondent 8: History 3, examination 2. Total 5. So 8 is in.

Respondent 9: Both are 2. Sum 4. Excluded.

Respondent 7: History 2, examination 3. Total 5. So 7 is added.

Respondent 14: Both 2. Sum 4. Exclude.

Respondent 2: History 2, examination 3. Total 5. So 2 is included.

Respondent 18: Both 2. Sum 4. Excluded.

Wait, let me double-check each:

- 23: 2+2=4 → no
- 10: 2+2=4 → no
- 15: 2+3=5 → yes
- 3: 3+3=6 → yes
- 8: 3+2=5 → yes
- 9: 2+2=4 → no
- 7: 2+3=5 → yes
- 14: 2+2=4 → no
- 2: 2+3=5 → yes
- 18: 2+2=4 → no

So the respondents with total >4 are 15, 3, 8, 7, 2. Let me check the data again to make sure I didn't mix up any numbers.

Looking at respondent 3: their answers show history 3 and examination 3. Correct. 3+3=6. Yes.

Respondent 2: history is 2, examination 3. 2+3=5. Correct.

So the final list should be respondents 3, 2, 7, 8, 15. Wait, but the order in the data is 23,10,15,3,8,9,7,14,2,18. So the correct order in the answer should be 3, 8, 7, 2, 15? Or just list them as per their numbers. The answer should be a comma-separated list of respondent IDs. Let me list them in numerical order: 2, 3, 7, 8, 15. 

Yes, that's correct. So the answer is these five respondents.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents who scored 3 on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and whose 'Comments' contain the word 'unclear'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The goal is to find all respondents who scored 3 on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and have the word 'unclear' in their Comments.

First, I need to look at the 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' field. The rubric says a score of 3 means ""Clear comprehensive recommendation without questioning"". So I need to check each response where this score is 3.

Next, the Comments field must include the word 'unclear'. I'll need to scan each of those respondents' Comments for that exact word, case-insensitive, but according to the data, the comments are as provided. Let's check each response one by one.

Looking at the responses:

1. Respondent 21: 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' is 3. Comments: ""Diagnostic clarity is present\nGood and early assessment of condition is done"". No 'unclear' here.
2. Respondent 5: Score is 2. So skip.
3. Respondent 9: 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' is 3. Comments: ""Overall a bit unclear communication reflected"". Here, 'unclear' is present.
4. Respondent 22: Score is 2. Skip.
5. Respondent 3: Score is 3. Comments mention ""not oriented in TPP"" and ""Clear communication..."", no 'unclear'.
6. Respondent 2: Score is 2. Skip.
7. Respondent 6: Score is 2. Skip.
8. Respondent 10: Score is 2. Skip.
9. Respondent 16: Score is 2. Skip.

So only respondent 9 meets both criteria.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents who scored 2 on 'Assessment' and whose 'Comments' contain the word 'Clear'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The goal is to find all respondents who scored 2 on 'Assessment' and whose 'Comments' include the word 'Clear'. 

First, I need to look through each response in the dataset. Let me start by understanding the structure. The 'responses' array contains multiple entries, each with a 'respondent' ID and their 'answers'. 

The two criteria are:
1. The 'Assessment' score must be 2.
2. The 'Comments' field must contain the word 'Clear' (case-insensitive, I assume).

I'll go through each respondent one by one.

Starting with respondent 10: Their 'Assessment' is 2. Now check the 'Comments': ""Time: (15:53-16:14)"". No 'Clear' here. So, skip.

Respondent 15: 'Assessment' is 2. Comments: ""Detailed Response - clear communication"". The word 'clear' is present. So this one qualifies. Add 15 to the list.

Respondent 4: 'Assessment' is 2. Comments mention 'Clinical handover and communication skills, satisfactory...' No 'Clear' here. Skip.

Respondent 22: 'Assessment' is 2. Comments: ""Clear communication skills\nGood"". 'Clear' is present. So respondent 22 is included.

Respondent 23: 'Assessment' is 3. Doesn't meet the first criterion. Skip.

Respondent 13: 'Assessment' is 2. Comments: ""Lack of communication between 2 main interns..."". No 'Clear'. Skip.

Respondent 9: 'Assessment' is 2. Comments: ""Overall a bit unclear communication reflected"". 'Unclear' is there, but not 'Clear'. So no.

Respondent 16: 'Assessment' is 3. Skip.

Respondent 8: 'Assessment' is 2. Comments: ""Clear communication during handover\nGood"". 'Clear' is present. Add 8.

Respondent 2: 'Assessment' is 3. Skip.

Respondent 19: 'Assessment' is 2. Comments: ""Clarity is a bit low..."". 'Clarity' is different from 'Clear', so maybe not. But the task says 'contain the word 'Clear''. Since 'Clarity' isn't the same, this one doesn't count. Wait, but maybe 'Clarity' has 'clear' in it? No, 'Clarity' is a noun form. The exact word 'Clear' needs to be present. So respondent 19 is out.

Respondent 1: 'Assessment' is 3. Skip.

Wait, did I miss any? Let me check again. 

Looking at respondent 8 again: Their 'Assessment' is 2 and comments have 'Clear communication during handover'. So yes, that's a match. 

So the respondents meeting both criteria are 15, 22, and 8. Wait, but let me verify each again.

Wait, respondent 8's 'Assessment' is 2? Let me check the data. Yes, in the response for respondent 8, under 'Assessment' the value is 2. And the comments have 'Clear communication during handover'. So yes, that's a valid entry.

Wait, but looking back at the data provided, respondent 8's answers:

""respondent"": ""8"",
""answers"": {
  ...
  ""Assessment"": 2,
  ...
  ""Comments"": ""Clear communication during handover\nGood""
}

Yes, so that's correct. So the respondents are 15, 22, and 8. Wait, but wait, let me check again.

Wait, respondent 22's 'Assessment' is 2? Let me check. In the data for respondent 22: ""Assessment"": 2. Yes. Comments: ""Clear communication skills\nGood"". So that's a match.

So the three respondents are 15, 22, and 8. But wait, let me check the data again to make sure I didn't miss any others.

Looking at respondent 9: 'Assessment' is 2. Comments: ""Overall a bit unclear communication reflected"". The word 'unclear' is present, but not 'clear'. So no.

Respondent 16: 'Assessment' is 3. No.

Respondent 8: Yes, as discussed.

So the final list should be respondents 15, 22, and 8. Wait, but wait, let me check the data again. Let me go through each entry again to be thorough.

Respondent 10: Assessment 2, comments no 'Clear' → no.

Respondent 15: Assessment 2, comments 'clear communication' → yes.

Respondent 4: Assessment 2, comments no → no.

Respondent 22: Assessment 2, comments 'Clear communication skills' → yes.

Respondent 23: Assessment 3 → no.

Respondent 13: Assessment 2, comments no → no.

Respondent 9: Assessment 2, comments 'unclear' → no.

Respondent 16: Assessment 3 → no.

Respondent 8: Assessment 2, comments 'Clear communication' → yes.

Respondent 2: Assessment 3 → no.

Respondent 19: Assessment 2, comments 'Clarity' → no.

Respondent 1: Assessment 3 → no.

So the correct respondents are 15, 22, and 8. Wait, but in the data provided, let me check respondent 8's date. The task doesn't mention date, so it's irrelevant here. The criteria are only Assessment=2 and Comments contain 'Clear'.

So the answer should be 15, 8, 22. But wait, the order? The example answer was just a single number, but here we have multiple. The task says ""list all respondents"", so the answer should be a comma-separated list of their IDs. Let me check the data again to confirm.

Yes, 15, 8, 22. But wait, wait. Let me check respondent 8's comments again. The comments are ""Clear communication during handover\nGood"". So 'Clear' is present. So yes. Respondent 22's comments: ""Clear communication skills\nGood"". 'Clear' is there. Respondent 15: ""Detailed Response - clear communication"". 'clear' with lowercase, but the task says to check if the word 'Clear' is present. The output instructions say to preserve capitalization, but the matching is case-insensitive? The task says ""contain the word 'Clear'"". So case-insensitive? The example in the output rules mentions case-insensitive for MCQ options, but for open-ended fields like Comments, it's exact text. Wait, the 'Comments' field is open-ended, so the output should be the exact text, but the task is to check if the comment contains the word 'Clear' (case-sensitive? Or case-insensitive? The task doesn't specify, but in the example, the answer was 15, whose comment has 'clear' in lowercase. But the task says ""contain the word 'Clear'"". So maybe case-sensitive. Let me check.

The task says: ""whose 'Comments' contain the word 'Clear'"". The word 'Clear' is capitalized here. So does that mean the exact case? For example, if the comment has 'clear' in lowercase, does it count? Or is it case-insensitive?

In the example given in the problem, the answer was 15. Let's look at the example. The example's task was to list respondents from '2025-05-04' who scored 3 on 'Situation'. The answer was 15. Looking at the data, respondent 15's 'Situation' is 3 and the date is '2025-05-04'. So that's correct. But in the current task, the example isn't directly related, but the key is whether the word 'Clear' is case-sensitive.

In the output rules, for open-ended fields, output the exact text. But the task is to check if the Comments contain the word 'Clear'. So if the comment has 'clear' in lowercase, does that count? The task uses 'Clear' with a capital C. But in the data, some comments have 'clear' in lowercase. For example, respondent 15's comment is ""Detailed Response - clear communication"". The word 'clear' is lowercase. The task says to look for 'Clear' with a capital C. So does that mean case-sensitive? Or is it case-insensitive?

This is a critical point. The task instruction says ""contain the word 'Clear'"". The quotes around 'Clear' might imply exact match, including case. However, in natural language processing, sometimes such tasks are case-insensitive unless specified. But given that the output rules mention preserving capitalization, perhaps the matching is case-sensitive.

If case-sensitive, then only comments with 'Clear' (capital C) would count. Let's check the data again.

Looking at the comments:

- Respondent 15: ""Detailed Response - clear communication"" → lowercase 'clear'.
- Respondent 22: ""Clear communication skills"" → capital 'C'.
- Respondent 8: ""Clear communication during handover"" → capital 'C'.

So if case-sensitive, then respondents 22 and 8 would be included, but 15 would not. However, in the example, the answer included respondent 15, whose 'Situation' was 3 and date '2025-05-04'. But in the current task, if case-sensitive, then 15's comment has 'clear' lowercase, so it wouldn't match 'Clear' with a capital C. But the example's answer included 15, which suggests that perhaps the matching is case-insensitive. Wait, the example's answer was based on date and Situation score, not on comments. So that's not directly relevant here.

The task's wording is crucial. The user wrote: ""whose 'Comments' contain the word 'Clear'"". The word 'Clear' is in quotes and capitalized. But in data entry, sometimes people might not be consistent with case. However, according to the output rules, for open-ended fields, the exact text is to be output. But the task is to check if the comment contains the word, regardless of case? The problem statement doesn't specify case sensitivity, so perhaps the intended approach is to check for any case variation. 

Alternatively, perhaps the user expects an exact match. This is ambiguous. However, given that in the data, some comments have 'Clear' with a capital C and others lowercase, but the task uses 'Clear' in the query, it's possible that the intended answer is to match case-insensitively. 

Assuming case-insensitive matching, then 'clear' in any case would count. So respondent 15's comment has 'clear' (lowercase), which would match. Respondent 22 and 8 have 'Clear' (capitalized), which also match. So all three would be included. 

But if case-sensitive, only 22 and 8 would be included. 

This is a critical point. How to resolve this ambiguity? Let's look at the output rules again. The output rules mention for open-ended fields to output the exact text. But the task is to check if the comment contains the word 'Clear'. The problem statement doesn't specify case, so perhaps the intended answer is case-insensitive. 

In the example provided, the answer was 15, which in their data has a 'Situation' score of 3. But in the current task, the example isn't directly related. 

Given that the task is to find comments containing the word 'Clear', and the data has both 'Clear' and 'clear', but the task uses 'Clear' in the query, it's safer to assume case-insensitive unless specified otherwise. Therefore, all three respondents (15, 22, 8) would be included. 

Wait, but let's check the data again:

Respondent 15's comment: ""Detailed Response - clear communication"" → 'clear' lowercase.

Respondent 22: ""Clear communication skills"" → 'Clear' uppercase.

Respondent 8: ""Clear communication during handover"" → 'Clear' uppercase.

If the task is case-insensitive, all three are included. If case-sensitive, only 22 and 8. 

But the problem statement doesn't specify, so this is ambiguous. However, in typical data analysis scenarios, such text searches are often case-insensitive unless specified. Therefore, I'll proceed under the assumption that case doesn't matter. 

Thus, the respondents meeting both criteria (Assessment=2 and Comments contain 'clear' in any case) are 15, 22, and 8. 

Wait, but let me check the 'Assessment' scores again for these three:

- 15: Assessment 2 → yes.
- 22: Assessment 2 → yes.
- 8: Assessment 2 → yes.

Yes. So the answer should be 15, 8, 22. But wait, the order? The example answer was just a single number, but here we have multiple. The task says to list them, so the order might not matter. The correct list is 15, 8, 22. 

Wait, but let me check the data again for any other respondents. 

Respondent 9: Assessment 2, comments: ""Overall a bit unclear communication reflected"". The word 'unclear' is present, but not 'clear'. So no.

Respondent 16: Assessment 3 → no.

So the final list is respondents 15, 8, and 22. 

But wait, in the data, respondent 8's 'Date' is '2025-05-02', which is not relevant here. The task doesn't filter by date, so that's okay. 

Therefore, the answer should be 15, 8, 22. But let me check once more to ensure I didn't make a mistake.

Yes, all three meet the criteria. So the final answer is 15, 8, 22.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' is higher than the average 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' for all sessions on the same date.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find all respondents whose 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' score is higher than the average for all sessions on the same date. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The responses are in a list where each entry has a respondent ID and their answers, which include the Date and the 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' score. 

The key steps here are:
1. Calculate the average 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' score for each date.
2. For each respondent, compare their score to the average of their respective date.
3. Collect all respondents whose score is above that average.

Let me start by extracting all the dates and their corresponding scores. Looking at the responses:

- Respondent 11: Date 2025-04-04, score 3
- Respondent 20: 2025-05-02, score 2
- Respondent 9: 2025-05-04, score 3
- Respondent 1: 2025-05-02, score 2
- Respondent 3: 2025-04-04, score 3
- Respondent 8: 2025-05-02, score 2
- Respondent 22: 2025-05-16, score 2
- Respondent 21: 2025-05-16, score 3
- Respondent 10: 2025-03-14, score 2
- Respondent 17: 2025-05-04, score 3
- Respondent 13: 2025-03-14, score 2

Now, group the scores by date:

- 2025-03-14: Respondents 10 (2), 13 (2) → average (2+2)/2 = 2
- 2025-04-04: Respondents 11 (3), 3 (3) → average (3+3)/2 = 3
- 2025-05-02: Respondents 20 (2), 1 (2), 8 (2) → average (2+2+2)/3 = 2
- 2025-05-04: Respondents 9 (3), 17 (3) → average (3+3)/2 = 3
- 2025-05-16: Respondents 22 (2), 21 (3) → average (2+3)/2 = 2.5

Next, compare each respondent's score to their date's average:

- 2025-03-14: Average 2. Both respondents here scored 2. So none are above.
- 2025-04-04: Average 3. Both scored 3. Equal, not higher. So none.
- 2025-05-02: Average 2. All scored 2. No one above.
- 2025-05-04: Average 3. Both scored 3. Again, equal. No one above.
- 2025-05-16: Average 2.5. Respondent 22 scored 2 (below), respondent 21 scored 3 (above 2.5). So respondent 21 is above.

Wait, but looking at the data for 2025-05-16, respondent 21 has a score of 3, which is higher than the average of 2.5. So that's one respondent. 

Are there any others? Let me check again. 

Looking at all dates and their averages:

- 2025-05-16: 21 is the only one above. 

No other dates have scores higher than their average. 

So the answer should be respondent 21.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'Identification' is higher than the average 'Identification' for all sessions on the same date.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find all respondents whose 'Identification' score is higher than the average 'Identification' score for all sessions on the same date. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The 'responses' array contains each respondent's data, including their 'answers' which have the 'Date' and 'Identification' score. The 'questions' section defines 'Identification' as a rubric with scores from 0 to 3. 

The key steps here are:
1. Calculate the average 'Identification' score for each date.
2. For each respondent, compare their 'Identification' score to the average of their respective date.
3. Collect all respondents where their score is higher than the average.

Let me start by listing all the respondents and their dates and Identification scores:

- Respondent 16: Date 2025-05-02, Identification 3
- Respondent 17: Date 2025-05-04, Identification 3
- Respondent 21: Date 2025-05-16, Identification 3
- Respondent 15: Date 2025-05-04, Identification 3
- Respondent 9: Date 2025-05-04, Identification 3
- Respondent 6: Date 2025-04-04, Identification 3
- Respondent 14: Date 2025-03-14, Identification 3
- Respondent 23: Date 2025-03-14, Identification 3
- Respondent 2: Date 2025-04-04, Identification 3

Wait a minute, looking at all the respondents, every single one has an Identification score of 3. Let me double-check each entry to be sure. 

Checking each response:
- Respondent 16: 3
- 17: 3
- 21: 3
- 15: 3
- 9: 3
- 6: 3
- 14: 3
- 23: 3
- 2: 3

Yes, all of them have a score of 3. Now, the average for each date would be calculated by taking all respondents on that date and averaging their Identification scores. Since all scores are 3, the average for every date will also be 3. 

Therefore, comparing each respondent's score (which is 3) to the average (also 3), none of them have a score higher than the average. They are all equal. 

But wait, the task says ""higher than the average"". So if the average is 3, and all respondents have 3, there are no respondents with a score higher than the average. 

But let me confirm the dates and their respective respondents to ensure I'm grouping correctly. Let's group by date:

- 2025-03-14: Respondents 14 and 23. Both have 3. Average is 3.
- 2025-04-04: Respondents 6 and 2. Both have 3. Average is 3.
- 2025-05-02: Respondent 16. Average is 3.
- 2025-05-04: Respondents 17, 15, 9. All have 3. Average is 3.
- 2025-05-16: Respondent 21. Average is 3.

So in every group, the average is 3, and all individuals scored 3. Therefore, no one has a score higher than the average. The answer should be that there are no such respondents. But the example given in the problem had an answer of 15, which was a respondent from 2025-05-04. However, in that example, maybe the average was lower. But in this current dataset, all Identification scores are 3. 

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again. The current dataset's responses all have Identification 3. So the average for each date is 3, so no one is above. Therefore, the answer should be that there are no respondents meeting the criteria. But the example answer was 15, which was correct in that case because in the example data, perhaps the average was lower. But in the current task's data, all Identification scores are 3. 

Therefore, the final answer is that there are no respondents with Identification higher than the average on their date. But the output rules say to provide a list of IDs. So the answer would be an empty list. But according to the output rules, if the task is to list names or IDs, provide a comma-separated list. If there are none, perhaps the answer is an empty string. But maybe I should check again if I missed any respondent with a different score. 

Wait, let me check each response again:

Looking at each 'answers' object:

- 16: Identification 3
- 17: 3
- 21: 3
- 15: 3
- 9: 3
- 6: 3
- 14: 3
- 23: 3
- 2: 3

All are 3. So no one is above the average. Therefore, the answer is that there are no respondents. But the output format requires a list. So the answer is an empty list. But how to represent that? The example had a single number, but in this case, since none meet the criteria, perhaps the answer is an empty string. However, the output rules say ""provide a simple comma-separated list"". If there are none, maybe the answer is ""None"" or just empty. But according to the rules, if it's a count, provide the number. But here it's a list. So perhaps the answer is an empty string. But the user might expect to see ""None"" or similar. However, the example answer was ""15"", which was a list of one. So in this case, since there are none, the answer is an empty list. But how to represent that? Maybe just leave it blank. But the system might require an answer. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check again. 

Wait, perhaps I missed a respondent. Let me check each one again:

Respondent 16: 3
17:3
21:3
15:3
9:3
6:3
14:3
23:3
2:3

All 3. So no one is above the average. Therefore, the answer is that there are no respondents. So the answer is an empty list, which would be represented as nothing. But according to the output rules, if the task is to list names or IDs, provide a comma-separated list. So if there are none, perhaps the answer is an empty string. But maybe the user expects ""None"" or similar. However, the example answer was a number. But in this case, since all have the same score, the answer is that there are no respondents. So the final answer is an empty list. But how to represent that? The output rules say for a list, provide a comma-separated list. If there are none, perhaps just leave it blank. But the system might require an answer. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the data. Let me check again. 

No, the data is correct. All Identification scores are 3. Therefore, the answer is that there are no respondents with a score higher than the average. So the answer is an empty list. But according to the output rules, if the answer is a list, provide a comma-separated list. So the answer is an empty string. But how to represent that? Maybe just leave it as an empty string. But perhaps the user expects ""None"". However, the example answer was ""15"", which was a single ID. So in this case, since there are none, the answer is nothing. But the system might require an answer. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the data. Let me check once more. 

No, all Identification scores are 3. Therefore, the answer is that there are no respondents. So the final answer is an empty list. But according to the output instructions, for a list, provide a comma-separated list. So the answer is nothing. But perhaps the correct answer is an empty string. However, in the context of the problem, if there are no such respondents, the answer is none. But the output rules don't specify how to handle that. The example answer was a single number. So perhaps in this case, the answer is an empty string. But maybe the system expects ""None"". But according to the output rules, for a list, provide a comma-separated list. So if there are none, the answer is an empty string. Therefore, the answer is nothing. But the user might expect a response. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake. 

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the average. Let me recalculate. For each date:

- 2025-03-14: two respondents, both 3. Average is 3.
- 2025-04-04: two respondents, both 3. Average 3.
- 2025-05-02: one respondent, 3. Average 3.
- 2025-05-04: three respondents, all 3. Average 3.
- 2025-05-16: one respondent, 3. Average 3.

So all dates have an average of 3. All respondents have 3. Therefore, no one is higher. So the answer is that there are no respondents. So the final answer is an empty list. But how to represent that. The output instructions say for a list, provide a comma-separated list. So if there are none, the answer is an empty string. But perhaps the system expects ""None"" or similar. However, the example answer was ""15"", which was a valid ID. So in this case, the answer is that there are no respondents. Therefore, the answer is an empty list. So the final answer is nothing. But the user might expect a response. Alternatively, maybe the answer is ""None"". But according to the output rules, for a list, comma-separated. So the answer is an empty string. But perhaps the correct answer is ""None"". However, the example didn't have that. 

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the data. Let me check again. All respondents have Identification 3. So the answer is that there are no respondents with a higher score. Therefore, the answer is an empty list. So the final answer is nothing. But according to the output rules, the answer should be the human-readable value, which in this case would be an empty list. So the answer is an empty string. But perhaps the system expects ""None"". However, the example answer was a number. So in this case, the answer is that there are no respondents. Therefore, the answer is an empty list. So the final answer is nothing. But how to represent that. Maybe just leave it blank. But the system requires an answer. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is ""None"". But according to the output rules, the answer should be the human-readable value. If there are no respondents, then the answer is ""None"". But I'm not sure. The example answer was ""15"", which was a list of one. So in this case, the answer is an empty list. Therefore, the answer is nothing. But the system might require an answer. So perhaps the answer is ""None"". But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the answer is an empty string. 

But according to the output rules, for a list, provide a comma-separated list. If there are none, then the list is empty. So the answer is an empty string. But in the example, the answer was ""15"", which is a list with one element. So in this case, the answer is an empty string. Therefore, the final answer is nothing. But the user might expect ""None"". However, the output rules don't mention that. So I'll proceed with an empty answer. But perhaps the correct answer is that there are no such respondents. But how to represent that. Maybe the answer is ""None"". But according to the output rules, the answer should be the human-readable value. If the task is to list IDs, and there are none, then the answer is ""None"". But the example didn't have that. Alternatively, maybe the answer is an empty list. But the output rules say to provide a comma-separated list. So if there are no elements, the answer is an empty string. Therefore, the final answer is an empty string. But the user might not accept that. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake. 

Wait, perhaps I misread the data. Let me check again. All respondents have Identification 3. So the average for each date is 3. Therefore, no one is higher. So the answer is that there are no respondents. Therefore, the answer is an empty list. So the final answer is nothing. But according to the output rules, for a list, comma-separated. So the answer is an empty string. But perhaps the answer is ""None"". However, the example answer was ""15"", which is a number, but in that case, the answer was a list. So in this case, the answer is an empty list. Therefore, the answer is an empty string. So the final answer is nothing. But the system might require an answer. So perhaps the answer is ""None"". But I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the data. Let me check once more. All respondents have Identification 3. So the answer is that there are no respondents. Therefore, the answer is an empty list. So the final answer is nothing. But according to the output rules, the answer should be the human-readable value. If there are no respondents, the answer is ""None"". But the example didn't have that. So perhaps the answer is ""None"". But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the answer is an empty string. 

Given the output rules, I think the correct answer is an empty string, but since the user might expect ""None"", but according to the rules, it's a comma-separated list. So the answer is an empty string. Therefore, the final answer is nothing. But the system might not accept that. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake. 

Wait, perhaps there's a respondent with a higher score. Let me check again. All respondents have 3. So no. Therefore, the answer is that there are no respondents. So the answer is an empty list. So the final answer is nothing. But according to the output rules, the answer should be the human-readable value. So perhaps the answer is ""None"". But the example answer was ""15"", which was a number. So in this case, the answer is an empty list. Therefore, the answer is an empty string. But I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, maybe the answer is ""None"". But according to the output rules, for a list, comma-separated. So if there are none, it's empty. So the answer is an empty string. Therefore, the final answer is nothing. But the user might expect ""None"". However, the example didn't have that. So I'll proceed with an empty answer.

17,15,9,2

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Calculate the average 'Identification' score for each date:**
   - All respondents have an 'Identification' score of 3. Thus, the average for every date is 3.

2. **Identify respondents with scores higher than the date's average:**
   - Since all scores equal the average (3), no respondents have a score **higher** than the average. 

**Note:** The answer provided (""17,15,9,2"") is incorrect. This appears to be a mistake. The correct answer should be an empty list, as no respondents meet the criteria.",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondents participated in a session where the average 'Assessment' for that session name is greater than 2.0?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find which respondents participated in a session where the average 'Assessment' score for that session name is greater than 2.0. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The data has a 'responses' array where each respondent has an 'answers' object containing various fields, including 'SessionName' and 'Assessment'. The 'Assessment' score is a numerical value based on the rubric provided in the 'questions' section. 

The key steps here are:
1. Group all responses by their 'SessionName' to calculate the average 'Assessment' score for each session.
2. For each session, compute the average of the 'Assessment' scores from all respondents in that session.
3. Identify the sessions where this average is greater than 2.0.
4. Collect all respondents who participated in those sessions.

Let me start by listing all the responses and their 'SessionName' and 'Assessment' values.

Looking at each response:

1. Respondent 12: SessionName ""II (Anaphylaxis)"", Assessment 2
2. Respondent 14: SessionName ""IV-Hypoglycemia"", Assessment 3
3. Respondent 11: SessionName ""IV (AF)"", Assessment 3
4. Respondent 21: SessionName ""I (Myocardial infarction)"", Assessment 2
5. Respondent 4: SessionName ""III (Sepsis)"", Assessment 2
6. Respondent 6: SessionName ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"", Assessment 2
7. Respondent 20: SessionName ""IV (VT)"", Assessment 3
8. Respondent 22: SessionName ""IV (VT)"", Assessment 2
9. Respondent 23: SessionName ""II-Anaphylaxsis"", Assessment 3
10. Respondent 8: SessionName ""III (Sepsis)"", Assessment 2
11. Respondent 5: SessionName ""II - Anaphylaxsis"", Assessment 3

Now, group them by SessionName. Let's note that some session names might be similar but written differently, like ""II (Anaphylaxis)"", ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"", ""II-Anaphylaxsis"", and ""II - Anaphylaxsis"". Are these considered the same session? The names are slightly different, but the core seems to be about Anaphylaxis. However, since the exact session names differ, I have to treat them as separate sessions unless specified otherwise. The problem doesn't mention normalizing session names, so I must consider them as distinct based on their exact names.

So, the sessions and their respective 'Assessment' scores:

- ""II (Anaphylaxis)"": [2] (only respondent 12)
- ""IV-Hypoglycemia"": [3] (respondent 14)
- ""IV (AF)"": [3] (respondent 11)
- ""I (Myocardial infarction)"": [2] (respondent 21)
- ""III (Sepsis)"": [2, 2] (respondents 4 and 8)
- ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"": [2] (respondent 6)
- ""IV (VT)"": [3, 2] (respondents 20 and 22)
- ""II-Anaphylaxsis"": [3] (respondent 23)
- ""II - Anaphylaxsis"": [3] (respondent 5)

Now, calculate the average for each session:

1. ""II (Anaphylaxis)"": 2 → average 2.0 (not greater than 2.0)
2. ""IV-Hypoglycemia"": 3 → average 3.0 (greater than 2.0)
3. ""IV (AF)"": 3 → average 3.0 (greater than 2.0)
4. ""I (Myocardial infarction)"": 2 → average 2.0 (not)
5. ""III (Sepsis)"": (2 + 2)/2 = 2.0 (not)
6. ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"": 2 → 2.0 (not)
7. ""IV (VT)"": (3 + 2)/2 = 2.5 (greater than 2.0)
8. ""II-Anaphylaxsis"": 3 → 3.0 (greater)
9. ""II - Anaphylaxsis"": 3 → 3.0 (greater)

Wait, but ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" and ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" are two different session names? The hyphen placement and spacing differ. So they are considered separate sessions. However, looking at the data, respondent 23's session is ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" and respondent 5's is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"". So they are two separate sessions. Therefore, each has an average of 3.0.

Now, the sessions with average >2.0 are:

- IV-Hypoglycemia (3.0)
- IV (AF) (3.0)
- IV (VT) (2.5)
- II-Anaphylaxsis (3.0)
- II - Anaphylaxsis (3.0)

Now, find all respondents in these sessions.

Looking back:

- IV-Hypoglycemia: respondent 14
- IV (AF): respondent 11
- IV (VT): respondents 20 and 22
- II-Anaphylaxsis: respondent 23
- II - Anaphylaxsis: respondent 5

So the respondents are 14, 11, 20, 22, 23, 5.

Wait, but let me check each session's respondents again:

For ""IV-Hypoglycemia"": only respondent 14.

""IV (AF)"": only respondent 11.

""IV (VT)"": respondents 20 and 22.

""II-Anaphylaxsis"": respondent 23.

""II - Anaphylaxsis"": respondent 5.

So total respondents: 14, 11, 20, 22, 23, 5. That's six respondents.

But wait, let me check the data again to confirm:

Looking at each respondent:

- 14: IV-Hypoglycemia
- 11: IV (AF)
- 20: IV (VT)
- 22: IV (VT)
- 23: II-Anaphylaxsis
- 5: II - Anaphylaxsis

Yes, that's correct. So the answer should be these six respondents. Let me list their IDs: 5, 11, 14, 20, 22, 23.

But wait, the example given in the problem had an answer of 15, but in the example data, the correct answer was 15, but in the example, the answer was 5. Wait, no, the example was a different question. The example's answer was 15, but in the example data, the correct answer was 5. Wait, no, in the example, the user asked for respondents from '2025-05-04' who scored 3 on 'Situation', and the answer was 5. So in that case, the answer was the respondent 5. But in this task, the answer is different.

So, in this task, the answer should be the list of respondents 5, 11, 14, 20, 22, 23. Let me check if I missed any.

Wait, the session ""IV (VT)"" has two respondents: 20 and 22. Their 'Assessment' scores are 3 and 2. The average is (3+2)/2 = 2.5, which is greater than 2.0. So they are included.

The other sessions:

- IV-Hypoglycemia (14) has average 3.0
- IV (AF) (11) has average 3.0
- II-Anaphylaxsis (23) has average 3.0
- II - Anaphylaxsis (5) has average 3.0

So all these are included. Therefore, the respondents are 5, 11, 14, 20, 22, 23. Let me check if I have any other sessions that meet the criteria. No, the rest have averages of 2.0 or below.

So the final answer should be a comma-separated list of these respondent IDs: 5,11,14,20,22,23.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'Background (examination)' is higher than the average 'Background (examination)' for all sessions on the same date.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find all respondents whose 'Background (examination)' score is higher than the average for all sessions on the same date. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The responses array contains each respondent's answers, including the Date and the Background (examination) score. The goal is to compare each respondent's score to the average of all respondents on the same date.

So, the plan is:

1. **Group responses by date**: For each date, calculate the average Background (examination) score.
2. **Compare each respondent's score**: For each respondent, check if their score is higher than the average of their group (same date).

Let's start by grouping the responses by date. Looking at the data:

- The dates present are 2025-05-04, 2025-04-04, 2025-05-16, 2025-03-14.

Now, for each date, calculate the average Background (examination) score.

**For 2025-05-04:**
Respondents: 18, 15, 9
Scores: 2 (18), 3 (15), 2 (9)
Sum = 2 + 3 + 2 = 7
Average = 7 / 3 ≈ 2.333...

**For 2025-04-04:**
Respondents: 2, 3, 11
Scores: 3 (2), 3 (3), 3 (11)
Sum = 3 + 3 + 3 = 9
Average = 9 / 3 = 3

**For 2025-05-16:**
Respondents: 19, 4
Scores: 3 (19), 2 (4)
Sum = 3 + 2 = 5
Average = 5 / 2 = 2.5

**For 2025-03-14:**
Respondents: 13, 7, 23
Scores: 1 (13), 3 (7), 2 (23)
Sum = 1 + 3 + 2 = 6
Average = 6 / 3 = 2

Now, check each respondent's score against their date's average:

- **Respondent 18 (2025-05-04):** Score 2. Average is ~2.333. 2 < 2.333 → No.
- **Respondent 15 (2025-05-04):** Score 3. 3 > 2.333 → Yes.
- **Respondent 9 (2025-05-04):** Score 2. 2 < 2.333 → No.
- **Respondent 2 (2025-04-04):** Score 3. Average 3 → Not higher. Equal, so no.
- **Respondent 3 (2025-04-04):** Score 3. Same as average → No.
- **Respondent 11 (2025-04-04):** Score 3. Same → No.
- **Respondent 19 (2025-05-16):** Score 3. Average 2.5 → 3 > 2.5 → Yes.
- **Respondent 4 (2025-05-16):** Score 2. 2 < 2.5 → No.
- **Respondent 13 (2025-03-14):** Score 1. Average 2 → 1 < 2 → No.
- **Respondent 7 (2025-03-14):** Score 3. 3 > 2 → Yes.
- **Respondent 23 (2025-03-14):** Score 2. 2 = 2 → No.

So the respondents with scores higher than their date's average are 15, 19, and 7.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

List all respondents who scored perfectly on 'Identification' and 'Background (history)' and whose 'Background (examination)' is below the average for all sessions.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to list all respondents who scored perfectly on 'Identification' and 'Background (history)' and whose 'Background (examination)' score is below the average for all sessions. 

First, I need to understand the criteria. 

1. **Perfect scores on Identification and Background (history):** According to the rubric in the questions section, a score of 3 is the highest for both. So, I need to filter respondents who have 3 in both 'Identification' and 'Background (history)'.

2. **Background (examination) below average:** I need to calculate the average score of 'Background (examination)' across all sessions and then find respondents whose score in this category is less than that average.

Let's start by going through each respondent in the responses data.

Looking at the responses:

- **Respondent 22**: 
  - Identification: 3
  - Background (history): 3
  - Background (examination): 3
  So, perfect scores on the first two, but examination is 3. Need to check if 3 is below the average.

- **Respondent 18**:
  - Identification: 3
  - Background (history): 2 (Not 3, so exclude)
  
- **Respondent 15**:
  - Identification: 3
  - Background (history): 2 (Exclude)
  
- **Respondent 14**:
  - Identification: 3
  - Background (history): 2 (Exclude)
  
- **Respondent 2**:
  - Identification: 3
  - Background (history): 2 (Exclude)
  
- **Respondent 7**:
  - Identification: 3
  - Background (history): 2 (Exclude)
  
- **Respondent 17**:
  - Identification: 3
  - Background (history): 3
  - Background (examination): 3 (Again, need to check average)
  
- **Respondent 12**:
  - Identification: 3
  - Background (history): 3
  - Background (examination): 3

So, the respondents who have 3 in both Identification and Background (history) are 22, 17, and 12. Now, need to check if their Background (examination) is below the average.

Next, calculate the average of Background (examination) across all responses. Let's list all the scores:

- Respondent 22: 3
- Respondent 18: 2
- Respondent 15: 3
- Respondent 14: 2
- Respondent 2: 3
- Respondent 7: 3
- Respondent 17: 3
- Respondent 12: 3

Adding these up: 3 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 22. There are 8 respondents. Average is 22 / 8 = 2.75.

So, the average is 2.75. Therefore, any score below 2.75 would be 2 or lower. 

Looking at the three candidates (22, 17, 12), all have Background (examination) scores of 3, which is above 2.75. Wait, that can't be right. But according to the calculation, the average is 2.75. So a score of 3 is above average, so they don't qualify. But then, are there any respondents who meet the first two criteria and have a score below 2.75?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recheck the scores:

Wait, the Background (examination) scores:

- 22:3
- 18:2
- 15:3
- 14:2
- 2:3
- 7:3
- 17:3
- 12:3

Total: 3+2+3+2+3+3+3+3 = 22. 22/8 = 2.75. Correct.

So, the average is 2.75. Therefore, scores below 2.75 are 2 or lower. So, any respondent with a Background (examination) score of 2 or lower would qualify. But the three candidates (22,17,12) all have 3, which is above average. Therefore, none of them meet the third condition. 

Wait, but that can't be. The example given in the problem had an answer of 15, but in the example, the task was different. Let me make sure I'm not mixing up the example with the current task.

Wait, the current task is different. The example was about listing respondents from a specific date with a specific score. The current task is about perfect scores on Identification and Background (history), and Background (examination) below average.

So, according to the data, the only respondents with Identification and Background (history) both 3 are 22,17,12. But all have Background (examination) 3, which is above average. Therefore, there are no respondents meeting all three criteria. But that seems odd. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I missed a respondent. Let me go through each response again:

- Respondent 22: Identification 3, Background (history) 3, exam 3
- Respondent 18: Identification 3, history 2 → exclude
- Respondent 15: Identification 3, history 2 → exclude
- Respondent 14: Identification 3, history 2 → exclude
- Respondent 2: Identification 3, history 2 → exclude
- Respondent 7: Identification 3, history 2 → exclude
- Respondent 17: Identification 3, history 3, exam 3
- Respondent 12: Identification 3, history 3, exam 3

So, only 22,17,12 have both Identification and history at 3. All have exam at 3, which is above average. Therefore, no one meets the criteria. But that can't be the case. Wait, maybe I miscalculated the average. Let me recount:

Total of Background (examination) scores:

3 (22) + 2 (18) +3 (15) +2 (14) +3 (2) +3 (7) +3 (17) +3 (12) = 

Let's add step by step:

Start with 0.

+3 → 3

+2 →5

+3 →8

+2 →10

+3 →13

+3 →16

+3 →19

+3 →22. Yes, total 22. 22/8 = 2.75. Correct.

So, the average is 2.75. Therefore, any score below 2.75 is 2 or lower. But none of the candidates (22,17,12) have exam scores below 3. Therefore, the answer should be that there are no respondents meeting all criteria. But the example had an answer, so maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the criteria. Let me recheck the task:

""List all respondents who scored perfectly on 'Identification' and 'Background (history)' and whose 'Background (examination)' is below the average for all sessions.""

So, the key is that the 'Background (examination)' must be below the average. The average is 2.75. So, scores below 2.75 are 2 or lower. But the three candidates have 3, which is above. Therefore, no respondents meet all three conditions. 

But that seems counterintuitive. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating the average. Let me check again:

Total scores for Background (examination):

22:3

18:2

15:3

14:2

2:3

7:3

17:3

12:3

Adding these: 3+2=5, +3=8, +2=10, +3=13, +3=16, +3=19, +3=22. 22 divided by 8 is indeed 2.75. So, the average is 2.75. Therefore, scores below that are 2 or lower. 

Looking at the three candidates (22,17,12), their exam scores are all 3, which is above 2.75. Therefore, none qualify. 

But the problem says to list them. If there are none, the answer would be an empty list. But perhaps I missed a respondent. Let me check each response again.

Wait, respondent 12: answers show Background (history) is 3, Identification 3, exam 3. Correct.

Respondent 17: same. 

Respondent 22: same.

No others. So, the answer is that there are no respondents meeting all three criteria. But the example had an answer, but that was a different question. Maybe the user expects a different approach. 

Wait, perhaps the average is calculated only for the sessions where the respondent has perfect scores on Identification and Background (history). But the task says ""below the average for all sessions"". So the average is across all sessions, not just those that meet the first two criteria. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that there are no respondents who meet all three conditions. But the answer format requires a list. If there are none, perhaps the answer is an empty list. But the output rules say for a list, provide a comma-separated list. If none, maybe just leave it blank or state none, but according to the output rules, if it's a list, provide the list. 

But according to the data, there are no such respondents. Therefore, the answer is an empty list. However, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check once more.

Alternatively, perhaps the average is calculated as an integer. For example, if the average is 2.75, maybe it's rounded to 3, but the problem says ""below the average"", so even if it's 2.75, 2 is below. So, the answer remains that none of the candidates have exam scores below 2.75. 

Therefore, the final answer is that there are no respondents meeting all criteria. But the output instructions say to provide a simple comma-separated list, so if there are none, perhaps the answer is an empty string. But maybe I missed a respondent. Let me check again.

Wait, looking at respondent 2: Identification is 3, Background (history) is 2. So, excluded. Respondent 7: same. Respondent 14: same. Respondent 15: same. Respondent 18: same. So, only 22,17,12 have both Identification and history at 3, but their exam is 3. So, no one qualifies. 

Therefore, the answer is that there are no respondents. But the output format requires a list. So, perhaps the answer is an empty string. But the example had an answer of ""15"", which was a single respondent. However, in this case, maybe the answer is none. But I need to confirm once more.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the average calculation. Let me add the scores again:

Background (examination) scores:

3,2,3,2,3,3,3,3. Sum is 3+2=5, +3=8, +2=10, +3=13, +3=16, +3=19, +3=22. 22 divided by 8 is 2.75. Correct. So, average is 2.75. Therefore, any score below 2.75 is 2 or lower. 

The three candidates have 3, which is above. Therefore, no one qualifies. 

So, the answer is that there are no respondents meeting all the criteria. But the output instructions say to provide a list. If there are none, perhaps the answer is an empty list. However, the user might expect a different approach. Let me check if I misunderstood the criteria.

Wait, the task says ""scored perfectly on 'Identification' and 'Background (history)'"". Perfectly would mean the highest score, which is 3 for both. Correct. Then, their 'Background (examination)' must be below the average of all sessions. So, the average is 2.75. Therefore, their exam score must be 2 or lower. 

Looking at the three candidates, none have exam scores below 3. Therefore, the answer is no respondents. 

But perhaps the user expects a different interpretation. For example, maybe the average is calculated as an integer, but the problem doesn't mention rounding. So, the answer is that there are no respondents. Therefore, the output should be an empty list. But according to the output rules, if the answer is a list, provide a comma-separated list. If there are none, perhaps the answer is an empty string. But the example had a single number. 

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the data. Let me check the responses again.

Wait, respondent 17: answers show Background (examination) is 3. Correct. 

So, no, there's no mistake. Therefore, the answer is that there are no respondents meeting all three criteria. But the user might expect an answer. However, according to the data, that's the case. 

But perhaps I made a mistake in the initial filtering. Let me check again:

Which respondents have Identification=3 and Background (history)=3?

Looking at each response:

- 22: yes
- 18: Identification=3, history=2 → no
- 15: Identification=3, history=2 → no
- 14: Identification=3, history=2 → no
- 2: Identification=3, history=2 → no
- 7: Identification=3, history=2 → no
- 17: yes
- 12: yes

So, three respondents. All have exam=3. Therefore, none meet the third condition. 

Thus, the answer is that there are no such respondents. But the output format requires a list, so the answer is an empty list. However, the output rules say to provide a simple comma-separated list, so if there are none, perhaps the answer is an empty string. But maybe the user expects a different approach. 

Alternatively, perhaps I miscalculated the average. Let me check once more. 

Total exam scores: 3,2,3,2,3,3,3,3. Sum is 22. 22/8=2.75. Correct. 

Therefore, the answer is that there are no respondents. But how to present that? The output instructions say for a list, provide a simple comma-separated list. If there are none, perhaps the answer is ""None"" or leave it blank. But the example had a numerical answer. However, according to the rules, if the task is to list names or IDs, provide a list. If there are none, perhaps the answer is an empty string. But the user might expect to see ""None"" or similar. However, the example answer was ""15"", which was a number. 

But according to the output rules, if the question asks for a list, provide a comma-separated list. If there are none, perhaps the answer is just an empty string. But I need to follow the output rules strictly. 

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the criteria. Let me re-read the task:

""List all respondents who scored perfectly on 'Identification' and 'Background (history)' and whose 'Background (examination)' is below the average for all sessions.""

So, the three conditions are:

1. Identification = 3

2. Background (history) = 3

3. Background (examination) < average of all Background (examination) scores

The average is 2.75. So, Background (examination) must be <2.75. Therefore, scores of 2 or lower. 

Looking at the three candidates (22,17,12), their exam scores are 3, which is not below 2.75. Therefore, no one qualifies. 

Thus, the answer is that there are no respondents meeting all three criteria. But how to present this? The output rules say for a list, provide a comma-separated list. If there are none, perhaps the answer is an empty string. But maybe the system expects ""None"" or similar. However, according to the example, when there was a single answer, it was just the number. So, in this case, since there are none, the answer is an empty list. 

But the output instructions say: ""If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"")."" So, if there are none, perhaps the answer is an empty string. But I need to check if the system expects that. 

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check once more. 

Wait, perhaps the average is calculated as the mean, which is 2.75. So, any score less than 2.75 is 2 or below. The three candidates have 3, which is above. Therefore, no. 

Therefore, the answer is that there are no respondents. But the output must be the human-readable value. If the answer is none, perhaps the answer is ""None"". But according to the output rules, for a list, it's a comma-separated list. If there are no elements, perhaps it's an empty string. However, the example had a single number. 

Alternatively, maybe the average is calculated as an integer. For example, 2.75 rounded to 3. Then, below average would be 2 or lower. But even then, the three candidates have 3, which is equal to the rounded average. So, still not below. 

Alternatively, maybe the average is calculated as a floor or ceiling. But the problem doesn't specify rounding. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that there are no respondents meeting all three criteria. So, the answer is an empty list. But how to represent that. According to the output rules, for a list, provide a comma-separated list. If there are none, perhaps leave it blank. But the example had a single number. 

But according to the data, there are no such respondents. Therefore, the answer is that there are none. However, the output format requires a list. So, the answer is an empty string. But perhaps the user expects a different approach. 

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial filtering. Let me check again. 

Wait, respondent 12: Background (history) is 3, Identification 3, exam 3. Correct.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents who scored perfectly on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and whose 'Background (history)' is below the average for all sessions.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to list all respondents who meet three criteria: they scored perfectly (3) on both 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)', and their 'Background (history)' score is below the average of all sessions. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The 'questions' section defines each field, and the 'responses' array contains each respondent's data. 

Starting with the first part: checking for perfect scores on the two recommendation fields. The 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' has a rubric where 3 means ""Confident and required little or no questioning"". Similarly, 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' at 3 is ""Clear comprehensive recommendation without questioning"". So, I need to filter respondents who have a 3 in both these fields.

Next, the 'Background (history)' score needs to be below the average of all sessions. To find this, I'll calculate the average of all 'Background (history)' scores across all respondents. Then, check which respondents have a score lower than this average.

Let's start by extracting all 'Background (history)' scores. Looking at each response:

- Respondent 16: 3
- 21: 3
- 15: 2
- 2: 2
- 7: 2
- 9: 2
- 5: 3
- 10: 2
- 8: 3
- 12: 3
- 22: 3
- 20: 2

Adding these up: 3+3+2+2+2+2+3+2+3+3+3+2 = let's calculate:

3+3=6; +2=8; +2=10; +2=12; +2=14; +3=17; +2=19; +3=22; +3=25; +3=28; +2=30. Total sum is 30. There are 12 respondents. Average is 30/12 = 2.5. So, the average is 2.5. Therefore, 'Background (history)' scores below 2.5 are 2 or lower. But since the scores are integers (0,1,2,3), any score of 2 is exactly the average. Wait, 2.5 is the average. So scores below average would be 0, 1, or 2. But in the data, all 'Background (history)' scores are either 2 or 3, except maybe some. Wait, looking back:

Wait, let me recount the 'Background (history)' scores:

Respondent 16: 3

21:3

15:2

2:2

7:2

9:2

5:3

10:2

8:3

12:3

22:3

20:2

So all scores are either 2 or 3. The average is 2.5. So scores below average would be 2. So any respondent with 'Background (history)' of 2 is below average. Because 2 is less than 2.5. So that's the key point.

Now, the first two criteria: both recommendation scores must be 3. Let's check each respondent:

Looking through each response:

Respondent 16: 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' is 2, 'global' is 3. So doesn't meet both 3s.

21: 'clear recommendation' is 3, 'global' is 3. So meets both. But 'Background (history)' is 3, which is not below average. So excluded.

15: 'clear recommendation' is 2, 'global' is 2. No.

2: 'clear recommendation' is 2, 'global' is 1. No.

7: 'clear' 2, 'global' 2. No.

9: 'clear' 3, 'global' 2. So 'global' is 2, not 3. Doesn't meet.

5: 'clear' 2, 'global' 3. So 'clear' is 2. No.

10: both 2. No.

8: 'clear' 2, 'global' 3. No.

12: 'clear' 3, 'global' 3. Now check 'Background (history)': 3. Which is not below average. So excluded.

22: 'clear' 2, 'global' 3. No.

20: 'clear' 2, 'global' 3. No.

Wait, so the only respondent who has both recommendation scores as 3 is respondent 21 and 12. But their 'Background (history)' is 3, which is not below average. So there's no one who meets all three criteria? But that can't be right. Let me check again.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me go through each respondent again:

Looking for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' = 3 and 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' =3.

Looking at each response:

- 16: clear 2, global 3 → no.

- 21: clear 3, global 3 → yes. Background (history) 3 → not below average.

- 15: clear 2, global 2 → no.

- 2: clear 2, global 1 → no.

-7: clear 2, global 2 → no.

-9: clear 3, global 2 → no (global is 2, needs to be 3).

-5: clear 2, global 3 → no.

-10: both 2 → no.

-8: clear 2, global 3 → no.

-12: clear 3, global 3 → yes. Background (history) 3 → not below average.

-22: clear 2, global 3 → no.

-20: clear 2, global 3 → no.

So only respondents 21 and 12 have both recommendation scores as 3. But their 'Background (history)' is 3, which is equal to the average (2.5) but not below. Wait, the average is 2.5, so 3 is above average. Therefore, they are excluded. 

So there are no respondents who meet all three criteria. But that seems odd. Let me check if I missed any respondents.

Wait, looking again at respondent 12: 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' is 3, 'global' is 3. 'Background (history)' is 3. So that's above average. So no.

Respondent 21: same as above.

Any others? Let me check again. Maybe I missed someone.

Looking at the data again:

- Respondent 12: answers for recommendations are both 3. Background (history) 3.

- Respondent 21: same.

No others. So the answer would be that there are no respondents meeting all three criteria. But the example given in the problem had an answer, but that was a different question. Wait, the example was about a different query. So perhaps in this case, the answer is that there are no such respondents. But let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the average. Let me recalculate the sum of 'Background (history)' scores:

Looking at each respondent's 'Background (history)':

16:3

21:3

15:2

2:2

7:2

9:2

5:3

10:2

8:3

12:3

22:3

20:2

Total: 3+3=6; +2=8; +2=10; +2=12; +2=14; +3=17; +2=19; +3=22; +3=25; +3=28; +2=30. Sum is 30. Number of respondents:12. 30/12=2.5. Correct.

So average is 2.5. Therefore, scores below 2.5 are 2 or lower. So any respondent with 'Background (history)' of 2 is below average. Now, looking for respondents who have both recommendations at 3 and 'Background (history)' <2.5 (i.e., 2 or lower). 

But in the data, the only respondents with both recommendations at 3 are 21 and 12, both of whom have 'Background (history)' 3, which is above 2.5. Therefore, there are no respondents meeting all three criteria. 

But the task says to list them. If there are none, the answer would be an empty list. However, perhaps I made a mistake in checking. Let me check once more.

Wait, perhaps I missed a respondent. Let me go through each response again:

Respondent 16: clear rec 2, global 3 → no.

21: clear 3, global 3 → yes. Background 3 → no.

15: clear 2, global 2 → no.

2: clear 2, global 1 → no.

7: clear 2, global 2 → no.

9: clear 3, global 2 → no.

5: clear 2, global 3 → no.

10: both 2 → no.

8: clear 2, global 3 → no.

12: clear 3, global 3 → yes. Background 3 → no.

22: clear 2, global 3 → no.

20: clear 2, global 3 → no.

So no one meets all three criteria. Therefore, the answer is that there are no respondents. But the output format says to provide a comma-separated list. If there are none, perhaps the answer is an empty string. But according to the output rules, if the task is to list names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list. If none, maybe just say ""None"" or leave empty. But the example answer was ""15"", which was a single respondent. However, in this case, perhaps the answer is that there are no respondents. But let me check again.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the 'Background (history)' scores. Let me check each respondent again:

Looking for respondents with 'Background (history)' <2.5, which is 2 or lower. So scores 0,1,2. But in the data, all 'Background (history)' scores are 2 or 3. So any respondent with 2 is below average. Now, among the respondents who have both recommendations at 3, do any have 'Background (history)' 2?

Looking again:

Respondent 21: 'Background (history)' 3 → no.

Respondent 12: 'Background (history)' 3 → no.

No other respondents have both recommendations at 3. Therefore, the answer is that there are no such respondents. So the final answer is an empty list. But according to the output rules, if the task is to list, provide a comma-separated list. If none, perhaps the answer is ""None"" or just empty. But the example had a single number. However, in this case, the correct answer is that there are no respondents meeting the criteria. So the answer is an empty list. But let me check once more to be sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the average. Let me recheck:

Total sum of 'Background (history)' is 30. 12 respondents. 30/12=2.5. Correct. So any score below 2.5 is 2 or lower. So respondents with 2 in 'Background (history)' are below average. Now, are there any respondents with both recommendations at 3 and 'Background (history)' 2?

Looking again:

Respondent 9: 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' is 3, 'global' is 2. So no.

Respondent 12: both 3, but 'Background (history)' 3.

Respondent 21: same.

No others. So no one meets all three criteria. Therefore, the answer is that there are no respondents. So the output should be an empty string or ""None"". But according to the output rules, if it's a list, provide a comma-separated list. If there are none, perhaps the answer is just an empty string. However, the example answer was ""15"" which is a single respondent. But in this case, the answer is none. So the final answer is that there are no respondents meeting the criteria.
</think>

The task requires identifying respondents who scored 3 in both 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and have a 'Background (history)' score below the average of all sessions. 

1. **Calculate the average for 'Background (history)'**:  
   Sum of all 'Background (history)' scores = 30 (from 12 respondents).  
   Average = 30 / 12 = **2.5**.  
   Scores below 2.5 are **≤2**.

2. **Filter respondents with perfect recommendation scores**:  
   Only respondents **21** and **12** scored 3 in both recommendation fields.  

3. **Check 'Background (history)' for these respondents**:  
   - Respondent 21: 'Background (history)' = 3 (not below average).  
   - Respondent 12: 'Background (history)' = 3 (not below average).  

**Result**: No respondents meet all three criteria.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'Background (history)' is higher than the average 'Background (history)' for all sessions on the same date.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find all respondents whose 'Background (history)' score is higher than the average 'Background (history)' for all sessions on the same date. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The responses are in a list where each respondent has a 'respondent' ID and their answers, which include the 'Date' and 'Background (history)' score. 

The plan is to:
1. Calculate the average 'Background (history)' score for each date.
2. For each respondent, compare their 'Background (history)' score to the average of their respective date.
3. Collect all respondents who meet the condition.

Let me start by extracting all the dates and their corresponding 'Background (history)' scores. Looking at the responses:

- Respondent 21: Date 2025-05-16, score 3
- Respondent 20: 2025-05-02, score 2
- Respondent 8: 2025-05-02, score 3
- Respondent 6: 2025-04-04, score 3
- Respondent 10: 2025-03-14, score 2
- Respondent 18: 2025-05-04, score 2
- Respondent 1: 2025-05-02, score 2
- Respondent 14: 2025-03-14, score 2

Now, group by date and calculate averages:

- 2025-05-16: Only respondent 21, average is 3
- 2025-05-02: Respondents 20 (2), 8 (3), 1 (2). Sum is 2+3+2=7, average 7/3 ≈ 2.33
- 2025-04-04: Respondent 6, average 3
- 2025-03-14: Respondents 10 (2), 14 (2). Average (2+2)/2 = 2
- 2025-05-04: Respondent 18, average 2

Next, compare each respondent's score to their date's average:

- Respondent 21: 3 vs 3 → not higher (equal)
- Respondent 20: 2 vs 2.33 → 2 < 2.33 → no
- Respondent 8: 3 vs 2.33 → 3 > 2.33 → yes
- Respondent 6: 3 vs 3 → no
- Respondent 10: 2 vs 2 → no
- Respondent 18: 2 vs 2 → no
- Respondent 1: 2 vs 2.33 → no
- Respondent 14: 2 vs 2 → no

Only respondent 8 (score 3 on 2025-05-02) has a score higher than the average of their date (2.33). So the answer should be respondent 8.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents who scored perfectly on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 'Situation' and whose 'Identification' is below the average for all sessions.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to list all respondents who scored perfectly on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 'Situation' and whose 'Identification' is below the average for all sessions. 

First, I need to understand the criteria. 

1. **Perfect scores on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 'Situation':** 
   - Looking at the questions schema, 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' has a rubric where 3 is the highest score (""Confident and required little or no questioning""). So a perfect score here is 3.
   - Similarly, 'Situation' has a maximum score of 3 (""Identifies and prioritizes the main problem(s) unprompted""). So both these fields need to be 3.

2. **'Identification' below the average for all sessions:**
   - The 'Identification' field's rubric goes up to 3. I need to calculate the average score of all respondents for 'Identification' and then find those respondents whose 'Identification' score is below that average.

Let me start by extracting the necessary data from the responses.

First, let's list all respondents and their scores for the relevant fields. 

Looking at each respondent in the responses array:

- **Respondent 8:**
  - Date: 2025-05-02
  - Recommendation (global rating scale): 3
  - Situation: 3
  - Identification: 3

- **Respondent 4:**
  - Date: 2025-05-16
  - Recommendation (global rating scale): 2
  - Situation: 3
  - Identification: 3

- **Respondent 15:**
  - Date: 2025-05-04
  - Recommendation (global rating scale): 2
  - Situation: 3
  - Identification: 3

- **Respondent 22:**
  - Date: 2025-05-16
  - Recommendation (global rating scale): 3
  - Situation: 3
  - Identification: 3

- **Respondent 5:**
  - Date: 2025-05-04
  - Recommendation (global rating scale): 3
  - Situation: 3
  - Identification: 3

- **Respondent 16:**
  - Date: 2025-05-02
  - Recommendation (global rating scale): 3
  - Situation: 3
  - Identification: 3

- **Respondent 10:**
  - Date: 2025-03-14
  - Recommendation (global rating scale): 2
  - Situation: 2
  - Identification: 2

- **Respondent 9:**
  - Date: 2025-05-04
  - Recommendation (global rating scale): 2
  - Situation: 3
  - Identification: 3

Now, first filter those who have both 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 'Situation' scores of 3. Let's check each:

- **Respondent 8:** Both 3. So included.
- **Respondent 4:** Recommendation is 2. Excluded.
- **Respondent 15:** Recommendation is 2. Excluded.
- **Respondent 22:** Both 3. Included.
- **Respondent 5:** Both 3. Included.
- **Respondent 16:** Both 3. Included.
- **Respondent 10:** Situation is 2. Excluded.
- **Respondent 9:** Recommendation is 2. Excluded.

So the candidates after first filter are respondents 8, 22, 5, 16.

Next, calculate the average 'Identification' score across all sessions. Let's sum all Identification scores and divide by the number of respondents.

Looking at all respondents' Identification scores:

- 8: 3
- 4: 3
- 15: 3
- 22: 3
- 5: 3
- 16: 3
- 10: 2
- 9: 3

Total sum = 3+3+3+3+3+3+2+3 = 23
Number of respondents = 8
Average = 23 / 8 = 2.875

So the average Identification score is 2.875. We need respondents whose Identification is below this average. Since the scores are integers (0,1,2,3), any score below 2.875 would be 2 or lower. 

Looking at the candidates from the first filter (8,22,5,16), all have Identification 3, which is above the average. Wait, but that can't be right. Wait, the average is 2.875, so 3 is above average. Therefore, none of the candidates from the first filter have Identification below average. But that would mean the answer is no one. But let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the average. Let me recount:

Total sum: 3 (8) +3 (4) +3 (15) +3 (22) +3 (5) +3 (16) +2 (10) +3 (9) = 3*7 +2 = 21 +2 =23. Yes, 23. 23/8=2.875. Correct.

So the average is 2.875. So any Identification score less than 2.875 would be 2 or lower. But all the candidates (8,22,5,16) have Identification 3, which is above average. Therefore, none of them meet the second condition. 

But wait, the task says ""whose 'Identification' is below the average for all sessions"". So if the average is 2.875, then any respondent with Identification ≤2 would be below. But in the candidates, all have 3. So there are no respondents who meet both criteria. 

But let me check if there's any other respondent who has both 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 'Situation' as 3, but Identification below 2.875. 

Looking back, the only respondent with Identification below 3 is respondent 10, who has Identification 2. But their 'Situation' is 2 and 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is 2, so they don't meet the first criteria. 

So, in this dataset, there are no respondents who meet all three conditions. Therefore, the answer should be an empty list. But wait, let me check again. 

Wait, maybe I missed a respondent. Let me go through each response again:

Respondent 8: All 3s except some other fields. Identification 3.

Respondent 4: Situation 3, but Recommendation (GRS) 2. Excluded.

Respondent 15: Situation 3, but GRS 2. Excluded.

Respondent 22: Both 3s. Identification 3.

Respondent 5: Both 3s. Identification 3.

Respondent 16: Both 3s. Identification 3.

Respondent 10: Doesn't meet the first criteria.

Respondent 9: GRS 2. Excluded.

So all the candidates have Identification 3, which is above the average of 2.875. Therefore, there are no respondents that meet all the conditions. 

But the example given in the problem had a similar structure and the answer was 15. But in that case, the date was 2025-05-04 and Situation 3. But in this task, the conditions are different. 

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check the average again. 

Total Identification scores: 3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3. That's seven 3s and one 2. Sum is 3*7=21 +2=23. 23/8=2.875. Correct. So the average is 2.875. So any score below that is 2 or lower. But none of the candidates have Identification below 3. So the answer is no respondents. 

But the problem says ""list all respondents"", so if none meet, the answer is empty. But maybe I made a mistake in the first filter. Let me check again. 

First filter: respondents with 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' 3 and 'Situation' 3. 

Looking at each:

- Respondent 8: GRS 3, Situation 3 → included.
- Respondent 22: GRS 3, Situation 3 → included.
- Respondent 5: GRS 3, Situation 3 → included.
- Respondent 16: GRS 3, Situation 3 → included.

These four. All have Identification 3. So their Identification is above average. Therefore, none meet the second condition. 

Thus, the answer should be that there are no respondents meeting all criteria. But the output format says if it's a list, provide a comma-separated list. So maybe the answer is an empty string. But according to the output rules, if the task is to list names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list. If there are none, perhaps the answer is ""None"" or just empty. But the example answer was ""15"" as a single number. 

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the average calculation. Let me check again. 

Total sum: 3+3+3+3+3+3+2+3 = 23. 23 divided by 8 is indeed 2.875. So average is 2.875. So any Identification score less than that is 2. So respondents with Identification 2. But in the first filter, all have Identification 3. So no one qualifies. 

Therefore, the answer is that there are no respondents meeting the criteria. But the output format says to provide a list. So the answer would be an empty list. But maybe the user expects a different approach. 

Wait, perhaps the average is calculated only for the sessions where the respondents have the perfect scores. Wait, the task says ""whose 'Identification' is below the average for all sessions"". So the average is across all sessions, not just those who passed the first two criteria. So the average is 2.875 as calculated. 

Therefore, the answer is that there are no respondents. But let me check if any of the respondents have Identification 2. The only one is respondent 10, but they don't meet the first two criteria. 

So the final answer is that there are no respondents. But according to the output rules, if it's a list, provide a comma-separated list. If there are none, perhaps the answer is an empty string. But maybe the system expects to write ""None"". However, the example answer was a single number. 

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the first filter. Let me check again. 

Wait, the task says ""scored perfectly on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 'Situation'"". So both must be 3. 

Looking at the responses:

- Respondent 8: GRS 3, Situation 3 → yes.
- Respondent 22: GRS 3, Situation 3 → yes.
- Respondent 5: GRS 3, Situation 3 → yes.
- Respondent 16: GRS 3, Situation 3 → yes.

All four have Identification 3, which is above average. So none meet the second condition. 

Therefore, the answer is that there are no respondents. But the output format requires a list. So the answer is an empty list. But how to represent that? The example had ""15"" as the answer. Maybe in this case, the answer is an empty string. But according to the output rules, if it's a list, provide a comma-separated list. If there are none, perhaps just leave it blank. But the user might expect ""None"". However, the example didn't have that. 

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the average calculation. Let me check once more. 

Total Identification scores: 3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3. Sum 23. 23/8=2.875. Correct. 

So the answer is that there are no respondents. Therefore, the output should be empty. But according to the output rules, if the task is to list names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list. If there are none, perhaps the answer is an empty string. But maybe the system expects to write ""None"" or similar. However, the example didn't have that. 

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the data. Let me check the respondents again. 

Wait, respondent 9: answers.Date is 2025-05-04, SessionName II (Anaphylaxsis), Identification 3, Situation 3, GRS 2. So GRS is 2, so not included. 

So no, no one else. 

Therefore, the answer is that there are no respondents meeting the criteria. So the output is empty. But according to the output rules, for a list, provide a comma-separated list. So the answer is an empty string. But maybe the system expects to write ""None"". However, the example answer was ""15"" when there was a match. 

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the task understanding. Let me re-read the task.

The task is: List all respondents who scored perfectly on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 'Situation' and whose 'Identification' is below the average for all sessions.

So, the three conditions:

1. Recommendation (GRS) = 3
2. Situation = 3
3. Identification < average(Identification across all sessions)

As calculated, average is 2.875. So Identification must be <2.875, which is 2 or lower. 

But all respondents who meet 1 and 2 have Identification 3, which is above average. Therefore, no one qualifies. 

Thus, the answer is that there are no such respondents. So the output is an empty list. But how to represent that? The output rules say for a list, provide a comma-separated list. If there are none, perhaps leave it blank. But in the example, the answer was ""15"". So maybe in this case, the answer is an empty string. 

But the user might expect ""None"" or similar, but according to the output rules, it's not specified. However, the example had a single number. 

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the average calculation. Let me check once again. 

Total Identification scores:

Respondent 8: 3

4:3

15:3

22:3

5:3

16:3

10:2

9:3

Total: 3+3+3+3+3+3+2+3 = 23. 23/8=2.875. Correct. 

So yes, the average is 2.875. 

Therefore, the answer is that there are no respondents meeting all three conditions. So the output is an empty list. But according to the output rules, for a list, provide a comma-separated list. So the answer is nothing. But perhaps the system expects to write ""None"". However, the example didn't have that. 

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the first filter. Let me check again. 

Wait, the task says ""scored perfectly on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 'Situation'"". So both must be 3. 

Looking at the responses:

- Respondent 8: GRS 3, Situation 3 → included.

- Respondent 22: GRS 3, Situation 3 → included.

- Respondent 5: GRS 3, Situation 3 → included.

- Respondent 16: GRS 3, Situation 3 → included.

All have Identification 3. 

So their Identification scores are 3, which is above the average of 2.875. Therefore, none meet the third condition. 

Thus, the answer is that there are no respondents. So the output is an empty list. But how to represent that? The output rules say to provide a simple comma-separated list. If there are none, perhaps the answer is an empty string. But maybe the system expects to write ""None"". However, the example answer was a number. 

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the data. Let me check the respondents again. 

Wait, respondent 10 has Identification 2, but their GRS is 2 and Situation 2. So they don't meet the first two conditions. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that there are no respondents meeting all three criteria. So the answer is an empty list. 

But according to the output rules, if the task is to list names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list. So the answer is an empty string. But perhaps the system expects to write ""None"". However, the example didn't have that. 

Alternatively, maybe the average is calculated only among the respondents who meet the first two conditions. Wait, the task says ""below the average for all sessions"". So the average is across all sessions, not just those who meet the first two conditions. 

Therefore, the answer is that there are no respondents. So the output is empty. 

But the user might expect to see ""None"" or similar. However, according to the output rules, for a list, it's a comma-separated list. So if there are no elements, perhaps the answer is an empty string. 

But in the example, the answer was ""15"", which is a single respondent. So in this case, since there are none, the answer is empty. 

Therefore, the final answer is that there are no respondents, so the output is empty.
</think>

The respondents who scored perfectly on both 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' (3) and 'Situation' (3) are 8, 22, 5, and 16. However, the average 'Identification' score across all sessions is 2.875. All these respondents have an 'Identification' score of 3, which is above the average. Therefore, no respondents meet all the specified criteria.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

Which respondents participated in a session where the average 'Background (examination)' for that session name is greater than 2.0?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find which respondents participated in a session where the average 'Background (examination)' score for that session name is greater than 2.0. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The dataset has responses from various respondents, each with answers to different questions, including 'SessionName' and 'Background (examination)'. The goal is to group responses by the 'SessionName', calculate the average 'Background (examination)' score for each session, and then identify which respondents were part of sessions where this average exceeds 2.0.

Let me start by listing all the responses and their 'SessionName' and 'Background (examination)' scores. 

Looking at the responses:

1. Respondent 16: SessionName ""I - MI"", Background (examination) 3
2. Respondent 23: ""II-Anaphylaxsis"", 2
3. Respondent 8: ""III (Sepsis)"", 2
4. Respondent 15: ""III - Sepsis"", 3
5. Respondent 18: ""IV - VT"", 2
6. Respondent 5: ""II - Anaphylaxsis"", 3
7. Respondent 13: ""I-VF"", 1
8. Respondent 7: ""III-Sepsis"", 3
9. Respondent 20: ""IV (VT)"", -1 (Hmm, this might be an outlier or error, but I'll include it as is)
10. Respondent 10: ""(MI)-VT"", 2
11. Respondent 9: ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"", 2

Next, I need to group these by SessionName. However, I notice that the session names might have variations in formatting. For example, ""III (Sepsis)"", ""III - Sepsis"", and ""III-Sepsis"" could be the same session but written differently. Similarly, ""II-Anaphylaxsis"", ""II - Anaphylaxsis"", and ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"" might refer to the same session. I need to check if these are considered the same sessions or different. The problem statement doesn't mention normalizing session names, so I should treat them as different if the names are different. Wait, but maybe the variations are just in punctuation and spacing. Let me list all unique session names as per the data:

Looking at the SessionNames:

- I - MI
- II-Anaphylaxsis
- III (Sepsis)
- III - Sepsis
- IV - VT
- II - Anaphylaxsis
- I-VF
- III-Sepsis
- IV (VT)
- (MI)-VT
- II (Anaphylaxsis)

These all seem like different session names because of the different formatting (hyphens, spaces, parentheses). For example, ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" vs. ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" vs. ""II (Anaphylaxsis)""—each has different punctuation or spacing. Unless instructed otherwise, I should consider them distinct. However, maybe the user intended them to be grouped by the core name part. For example, ""III (Sepsis)"", ""III - Sepsis"", and ""III-Sepsis"" all have ""III"" and ""Sepsis"", so perhaps they are the same session. Similarly for the Anaphylaxsis sessions. But the problem statement doesn't specify this, so I have to take the SessionName exactly as given. 

But wait, the task is to group by session name. So if the session names are written differently, they are considered different sessions. For example, ""III (Sepsis)"" and ""III - Sepsis"" would be two different sessions. However, looking at the data, let's check:

Looking at the responses:

- Respondent 8: ""III (Sepsis)""
- Respondent 15: ""III - Sepsis""
- Respondent 7: ""III-Sepsis""

These three have session names that are variations of ""III Sepsis"". If the user intended these to be the same session, then we should group them. But since the problem doesn't mention normalizing session names, I have to treat them as separate. However, this might be a mistake. For example, in real data, these could be the same session but entered with different formatting. But without explicit instructions, I can't assume that. So, I'll proceed by treating each unique string as a separate session.

Wait, but let's check the example given. In the example, the answer was 15. Looking at the example, the question was to list respondents from sessions on '2025-05-04' who scored 3 on 'Situation'. The answer was 15, which corresponds to respondent 15, 18, 5, 9. Wait, in the example data, the answer was 15, but looking at the data, respondents 15, 18, 5, and 9 all have Date 2025-05-04 and Situation 3. But the example answer is just 15. Wait, maybe the example is incorrect, but perhaps the example is a simplified version. Anyway, perhaps in the example, the answer was 15, but in reality, there are multiple respondents. But that's the example, not the current task.

Back to the current task. Let's proceed by treating each SessionName as a distinct group, even if the names are similar. So, for each unique SessionName, calculate the average of 'Background (examination)' scores for all respondents in that session. Then, find which sessions have an average > 2.0. Then, list all respondents in those sessions.

So first, list all sessions and their 'Background (examination)' scores:

1. I - MI: [3] (only respondent 16)
   Average: 3.0

2. II-Anaphylaxsis: [2] (respondent 23)
   Average: 2.0

3. III (Sepsis): [2] (respondent 8)
   Average: 2.0

4. III - Sepsis: [3] (respondent 15)
   Average: 3.0

5. IV - VT: [2] (respondent 18)
   Average: 2.0

6. II - Anaphylaxsis: [3] (respondent 5)
   Average: 3.0

7. I-VF: [1] (respondent 13)
   Average: 1.0

8. III-Sepsis: [3] (respondent 7)
   Average: 3.0

9. IV (VT): [-1] (respondent 20)
   Average: -1.0

10. (MI)-VT: [2] (respondent 10)
    Average: 2.0

11. II (Anaphylaxsis): [2] (respondent 9)
    Average: 2.0

Now, calculate the average for each session:

Sessions with average > 2.0:

- I - MI: 3.0 → yes
- III - Sepsis: 3.0 → yes
- II - Anaphylaxsis: 3.0 → yes
- III-Sepsis: 3.0 → yes

Other sessions have averages of 2.0 or below. 

Now, list all respondents in these sessions:

- I - MI: respondent 16
- III - Sepsis: respondent 15
- II - Anaphylaxsis: respondent 5
- III-Sepsis: respondent 7

Wait, but wait, the session names are considered distinct. So ""III - Sepsis"" and ""III-Sepsis"" are different sessions. But in the data, ""III - Sepsis"" is respondent 15, and ""III-Sepsis"" is respondent 7. So each of these sessions has only one respondent, and their average is 3.0 each. Similarly, ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" (respondent 5) and ""I - MI"" (respondent 16) each have one respondent with a score of 3.0. 

Therefore, the sessions with average >2.0 are:

- I - MI (3.0)
- III - Sepsis (3.0)
- II - Anaphylaxsis (3.0)
- III-Sepsis (3.0)

The respondents in these sessions are 16, 15, 5, and 7.

Wait, but let me check again:

- Session ""I - MI"" has respondent 16.
- Session ""III - Sepsis"" has respondent 15.
- Session ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" has respondent 5.
- Session ""III-Sepsis"" has respondent 7.

So the respondents are 16, 15, 5, 7.

But wait, in the data, respondent 7's session is ""III-Sepsis"" (Date 2025-03-14), and respondent 15's session is ""III - Sepsis"" (Date 2025-05-04). So these are two different sessions with similar names but different dates. Therefore, they are separate sessions, each with one respondent. Each has a 'Background (examination)' score of 3, so their averages are 3.0 each. 

Similarly, ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" (respondent 5) and ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" (respondent 23) are different sessions. Respondent 5's session has a score of 3, average 3.0. Respondent 23's session has a score of 2, average 2.0. So only respondent 5's session qualifies.

So the qualifying respondents are 16, 15, 5, 7.

But let me check all the sessions again:

Looking at the list:

1. I - MI: 3.0 → yes
2. II-Anaphylaxsis: 2.0 → no
3. III (Sepsis): 2.0 → no
4. III - Sepsis: 3.0 → yes
5. IV - VT: 2.0 → no
6. II - Anaphylaxsis: 3.0 → yes
7. I-VF: 1.0 → no
8. III-Sepsis: 3.0 → yes
9. IV (VT): -1.0 → no
10. (MI)-VT: 2.0 → no
11. II (Anaphylaxsis): 2.0 → no

So sessions 1,4,6,8 have averages >2.0. The respondents in these sessions are:

- Session 1: 16
- Session 4: 15
- Session 6:5
- Session8:7

Therefore, the answer should be respondents 16,15,5,7.

But wait, let me check the data again to confirm:

Respondent 16: Session ""I - MI"", Background (examination) 3 → average 3.0.

Respondent 15: Session ""III - Sepsis"", Background (examination) 3 → average 3.0.

Respondent 5: Session ""II - Anaphylaxsis"", Background (examination) 3 → average 3.0.

Respondent 7: Session ""III-Sepsis"", Background (examination) 3 → average 3.0.

Yes, all these sessions have only one respondent each, so their average is their own score. Therefore, these four respondents meet the criteria.

But wait, are there any other sessions with more than one respondent? Let's check:

Looking through the data, each session name is unique except perhaps for the Anaphylaxsis ones. For example, ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" (respondent 23), ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" (respondent5), and ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"" (respondent9). These are three different session names. Each has only one respondent. So their averages are 2,3,2 respectively. Only respondent5's session (II - Anaphylaxsis) has an average of 3.0.

Similarly, the Sepsis sessions: ""III (Sepsis)"" (respondent8, score 2), ""III - Sepsis"" (respondent15, score3), ""III-Sepsis"" (respondent7, score3). Each is a separate session. So respondent8's session average is 2.0 (doesn't qualify), respondent15's is 3.0 (qualifies), respondent7's is 3.0 (qualifies).

So the final list is respondents 16,15,5,7.

But wait, let me check the data again to ensure I didn't miss any sessions with multiple respondents. For example, is there any session name that appears more than once with the same name? Let's list all session names:

1. I - MI (16)
2. II-Anaphylaxsis (23)
3. III (Sepsis) (8)
4. III - Sepsis (15)
5. IV - VT (18)
6. II - Anaphylaxsis (5)
7. I-VF (13)
8. III-Sepsis (7)
9. IV (VT) (20)
10. (MI)-VT (10)
11. II (Anaphylaxsis) (9)

All are unique. So each session has only one respondent. Therefore, the average for each session is the score of that single respondent. Therefore, any session where the 'Background (examination)' score is greater than 2.0 (i.e., 3) will have an average of 3.0, which is >2.0. So the question simplifies to: list all respondents who have a 'Background (examination)' score >2.0, because each session is only one respondent. Wait, but the question is about the average of the session. If a session has only one respondent, then the average is their score. So if their score is >2.0, then the session's average is >2.0. Therefore, the answer is all respondents with 'Background (examination)' score of 3, since the rubric for 'Background (examination)' is 0-3. So scores can be 0,1,2,3. So scores >2.0 are 3. Therefore, the answer is all respondents with 'Background (examination)' =3.

But wait, the task is to find sessions where the average 'Background (examination)' for that session name is >2.0. If a session has multiple respondents, the average is calculated across all of them. But in this dataset, each session name is unique, so each session has only one respondent. Therefore, the average is their individual score. Therefore, the answer is all respondents where their 'Background (examination)' score is 3. Because 3 >2.0.

Looking at the data, which respondents have 'Background (examination)' =3?

Looking through each response:

- 16: 3
- 23:2
-8:2
-15:3
-18:2
-5:3
-13:1
-7:3
-20:-1
-10:2
-9:2

So respondents 16,15,5,7 have 'Background (examination)' =3. Therefore, their sessions' average is 3.0, which is >2.0. Therefore, the answer is 16,15,5,7.

But wait, the example in the problem had a similar structure. The example asked for respondents on a specific date with a specific score, and the answer was 15. But in reality, there were multiple respondents. However, the example's answer was 15, but looking at the data, respondents 15,18,5,9 were on 2025-05-04 and had Situation=3. But the example's answer was 15. Maybe the example was simplified. But in our current task, the answer should be 16,15,5,7.

But let me double-check. The task is to find respondents in sessions where the session's average 'Background (examination)' is >2.0. Since each session has only one respondent, the average is their individual score. Therefore, any respondent with 'Background (examination)' score of 3 (since 3>2.0) would qualify. So the answer is respondents 16,15,5,7.

But wait, respondent 20 has 'Background (examination)' of -1. That's an anomaly, but according to the data, it's a valid entry. However, since the average for their session is -1.0, which is not >2.0, they are excluded.

So the final answer is respondents 16,15,5,7. Therefore, the list is ""16, 15, 5, 7"".

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'Background (history)' is higher than the average 'Background (history)' for all sessions on the same date.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find all respondents whose 'Background (history)' score is higher than the average 'Background (history)' for all sessions on the same date. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The 'responses' array contains each respondent's data, including the 'Date' and their scores for various questions, including 'Background (history)'. The 'questions' section provides the schema, but for this task, the key is the 'Background (history)' rubric.

So, the plan is:

1. **Calculate the average 'Background (history)' score for each date.**
   - For each date present in the responses, compute the average of all 'Background (history)' scores from respondents on that date.

2. **Compare each respondent's 'Background (history)' score against the average of their respective date.**
   - For each respondent, check if their score is higher than the average of their date's sessions.

3. **Collect all respondents who meet this criterion.**

Let's start by extracting all the dates and their corresponding 'Background (history)' scores.

Looking at the responses:

- Respondent 3: Date 2025-04-04, Background (history) 3
- Respondent 9: 2025-05-04, 2
- Respondent 14: 2025-03-14, 2
- Respondent 11: 2025-04-04, 3
- Respondent 17: 2025-05-04, 3
- Respondent 22: 2025-05-16, 3
- Respondent 1: 2025-05-02, 2
- Respondent 10: 2025-03-14, 2
- Respondent 12: 2025-05-02, 3

Now, group by date:

- **2025-04-04**: Respondents 3 and 11. Scores: 3 and 3. Average = (3+3)/2 = 3.
- **2025-05-04**: Respondents 9 and 17. Scores: 2 and 3. Average = (2+3)/2 = 2.5.
- **2025-03-14**: Respondents 14 and 10. Scores: 2 and 2. Average = 2.
- **2025-05-16**: Respondent 22. Score: 3. Average = 3.
- **2025-05-02**: Respondents 1 and 12. Scores: 2 and 3. Average = (2+3)/2 = 2.5.

Now, compare each respondent's score to their date's average:

- **Respondent 3 (2025-04-04, 3)**: 3 vs average 3 → equal, not higher. Exclude.
- **Respondent 9 (2025-05-04, 2)**: 2 vs 2.5 → lower. Exclude.
- **Respondent 14 (2025-03-14, 2)**: 2 vs 2 → equal. Exclude.
- **Respondent 11 (2025-04-04, 3)**: 3 vs 3 → equal. Exclude.
- **Respondent 17 (2025-05-04, 3)**: 3 vs 2.5 → higher. Include.
- **Respondent 22 (2025-05-16, 3)**: 3 vs 3 → equal. Exclude.
- **Respondent 1 (2025-05-02, 2)**: 2 vs 2.5 → lower. Exclude.
- **Respondent 10 (2025-03-14, 2)**: 2 vs 2 → equal. Exclude.
- **Respondent 12 (2025-05-02, 3)**: 3 vs 2.5 → higher. Include.

So, the respondents with scores higher than their date's average are 17 and 12. 

Wait, let me double-check:

For 2025-05-02, average is 2.5. Respondent 12 has a score of 3, which is higher. Correct. Respondent 17's date (2025-05-04) average is 2.5, and their score is 3, so included. 

Are there any others? Let's check again:

- Respondent 22 is the only one on 2025-05-16, so their score equals the average. No.

So the final list should be respondents 17 and 12. But wait, let me check the data again to confirm their respondent numbers.

Looking back:

Respondent 17: yes, score 3 on 2025-05-04.

Respondent 12: date 2025-05-02, score 3. The average for that date is 2.5, so yes.

Are there any other dates? For example, 2025-05-02 has two respondents: 1 (score 2) and 12 (3). Average is 2.5. So 12 is above. Correct.

So the answer should be respondents 17 and 12. Their IDs are ""17"" and ""12"". So the list is ""12, 17"" when sorted numerically. Wait, 12 comes before 17 numerically. So the correct order is 12, 17.
