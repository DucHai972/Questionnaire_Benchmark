</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents from sessions on '2025-05-02' who scored 3 on 'Background (examination)'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The question is asking to list all respondents from sessions on '2025-05-02' who scored 3 on 'Background (examination)'. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The data has a 'questions' section that defines each predicate, and a 'responses' section with each respondent's data. 

Looking at the 'questions', the 'Background_examination' predicate has the rubric. The score 3 corresponds to ""Comprehensive focused examination/observations"". So, I need to find respondents who have a value of ""3"" for pred:Background_examination.

Next, the date filter: the session date must be '2025-05-02'. So I need to check each respondent's pred:Date value against this date.

Now, let's go through each respondent in the 'responses' section:

- **Respondent3**: Date is 2025-04-04. Not the target date. Background_examination is 3, but date doesn't match. Exclude.
- **Respondent8**: Date is 2025-05-02. Background_examination is 2. Doesn't meet the score. Exclude.
- **Respondent10**: Date is 2025-03-14. Exclude.
- **Respondent22**: Date is 2025-05-16. Exclude.
- **Respondent7**: Date is 2025-03-14. Exclude.
- **Respondent5**: Date is 2025-05-04. Exclude.
- **Respondent1**: Date is 2025-05-02. Background_examination is 2. Exclude.
- **Respondent2**: Date is 2025-04-04. Exclude.
- **Respondent4**: Date is 2025-05-16. Exclude.
- **Respondent20**: Date is 2025-05-02. Background_examination is ""-1"". Exclude.

Wait, none of the respondents on 2025-05-02 have a Background_examination score of 3. Let me double-check each one again to be sure.

Looking at Respondent8 again: pred:Background_examination is ""2"". Respondent20 has ""-1"". Others on 2025-05-02 are Respondent1 and Respondent8. Neither have a 3 in Background_examination. 

So, there are no respondents from sessions on 2025-05-02 with a score of 3 in Background_examination. The answer should be an empty list, but since the example answer was 15 (probably a count), maybe the count here is 0. However, the task says to list the respondents, so if none meet the criteria, the answer is none. But according to the output rules, if it's a list, provide a comma-separated list. Since there are none, the answer is an empty list. But maybe I missed someone?

Wait, let me check again. Wait, the task says 'Background (examination)', which in the data is pred:Background_examination. Let me check all respondents with Date 2025-05-02:

- Respondent8: pred:Date ""2025-05-02"", pred:Background_examination ""2""

No one has a 3. So the answer is that there are no such respondents. Therefore, the list is empty. But according to the output rules, if it's a list, provide a comma-separated list. So the answer should be an empty string or just state none. However, the example answer was ""15"", which is a count. Wait, the task here is to list the respondents, not count them. Wait, the task says ""List all respondents..."", so the answer should be their IDs. But in the data, the respondents on 2025-05-02 are Respondent8, Respondent1, and Respondent20. None of them have Background_examination 3. So the answer is no respondents. But how to represent that? The output rules say for a list, provide a comma-separated list. If none, maybe just leave it blank or say ""None"". But the example answer was a number, but that was a different question. Here, the correct answer is that there are no respondents meeting the criteria. So the answer is an empty list. But the output format says for a list, provide a simple comma-separated list. So the answer is nothing, but maybe the system expects ""None"" or just an empty string. However, according to the output rules, if the task asks for a list, and there are none, perhaps the answer is an empty string. But to confirm, let me check again.

Yes, after verifying all respondents on 2025-05-02, none have a Background_examination score of 3. Therefore, the answer is that there are no such respondents. So the list is empty.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Find all respondents from the 'III (Sepsis)' session who scored 2 on 'Assessment' and 3 on 'Situation'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The goal is to find all respondents from the 'III (Sepsis)' session who scored 2 on 'Assessment' and 3 on 'Situation'. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The data has respondents with various predicates like pred:Date, pred:SessionName, pred:Situation, pred:Assessment, etc. The questions section defines what each predicate means, but for this task, the key is to focus on the responses.

The task specifies three criteria:
1. SessionName must be 'III (Sepsis)'.
2. Assessment score must be 2.
3. Situation score must be 3.

I'll start by going through each respondent in the responses and check these three conditions.

Looking at the respondents one by one:

- **Respondent18**: SessionName is ""IV - VT"". Doesn't match. Skip.
- **Respondent11**: SessionName is ""IV (AF)"". Not relevant. Skip.
- **Respondent12**: SessionName is ""II (Anaphylaxis)"". Nope.
- **Respondent15**: SessionName is ""III - Sepsis"". Hmm, the session name here is written with a hyphen instead of parentheses. The task is looking for 'III (Sepsis)', so maybe this is a variation. But I need to check if the system considers these the same. The data might have inconsistencies, but according to the data given, the exact SessionName for this respondent is ""III - Sepsis"", which is different from ""III (Sepsis)"". So maybe this doesn't count. But wait, maybe it's a typo. Let me check other entries. For example, Respondent8 has SessionName ""III (Sepsis)"", and Respondent4 also has ""III (Sepsis)"". So the exact match is important here. So Respondent15's session name is ""III - Sepsis"", which is different. So exclude.
- **Respondent9**: SessionName is ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"". Not relevant.
- **Respondent10**: SessionName is ""(MI)-VT"". No.
- **Respondent19**: SessionName is ""I - MI"". No.
- **Respondent8**: SessionName is ""III (Sepsis)"". This matches. Now check the scores. Situation is 3, Assessment is 2. So this meets both criteria. So Respondent8 is a candidate.
- **Respondent2**: SessionName is ""MI"". Doesn't match.
- **Respondent21**: SessionName is ""I (Myocardial infarction)"". No.
- **Respondent4**: SessionName is ""III (Sepsis)"". Check scores: Situation is 3, Assessment is 2. So this also meets the criteria. So Respondent4 is another candidate.

Wait, let me double-check the Assessment and Situation scores for these two:

- **Respondent8**:
  - pred:Situation ""3""
  - pred:Assessment ""2""
  - SessionName ""III (Sepsis)""
  So yes.

- **Respondent4**:
  - pred:Situation ""3""
  - pred:Assessment ""2""
  - SessionName ""III (Sepsis)""
  Also yes.

Are there any others? Let me check again.

Looking at Respondent15 again: SessionName is ""III - Sepsis"". The task specifies 'III (Sepsis)', so unless the hyphen is considered equivalent, which the data doesn't indicate, it's a different session name. So Respondent15 is out.

Any other respondents with SessionName ""III (Sepsis)""? Respondent8 and Respondent4. Both have the correct SessionName, Situation 3, and Assessment 2. So the answer should be these two respondents: 8 and 4. But wait, the answer format requires a comma-separated list of their IDs. The respondent IDs are :Respondent8 and :Respondent4, so the numbers are 8 and 4. So the list is ""8,4"".

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondents have a total score for 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' greater than 5?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find which respondents have a total score for 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' greater than 5. 

First, I need to make sure I understand the data structure. The data provided includes several respondents, each with various predicates (pred:) that correspond to different questions. The two relevant predicates here are 'pred:Recommendation_global_rating_scale' and 'pred:Recommendation_clear_recommendation'. 

Each of these predicates has a numerical value assigned to each respondent. The question asks for the sum of these two values to be greater than 5. So, I need to go through each respondent, add their scores for these two questions, and check if the sum exceeds 5.

Let me list out all the respondents and their scores for these two categories:

- **Respondent21**: 
  - Recommendation_clear_recommendation: 3
  - Recommendation_global_rating_scale: 3
  - Sum: 3 + 3 = 6

- **Respondent22**:
  - Clear: 2
  - Global: 3
  - Sum: 2 + 3 = 5

- **Respondent2**:
  - Clear: 2
  - Global: 1
  - Sum: 3

- **Respondent5**:
  - Clear: 2
  - Global: 3
  - Sum: 5

- **Respondent20**:
  - Clear: 2
  - Global: 3
  - Sum: 5

- **Respondent10**:
  - Clear: 2
  - Global: 2
  - Sum: 4

- **Respondent3**:
  - Clear: 3
  - Global: 3
  - Sum: 6

- **Respondent8**:
  - Clear: 2
  - Global: 3
  - Sum: 5

- **Respondent23**:
  - Clear: 3
  - Global: 3
  - Sum: 6

- **Respondent9**:
  - Clear: 3
  - Global: 2
  - Sum: 5

- **Respondent13**:
  - Clear: 2
  - Global: 2
  - Sum: 4

- **Respondent7**:
  - Clear: 2
  - Global: 2
  - Sum: 4

Now, I need to check which of these sums are greater than 5. 

Looking at the sums:
- Respondent21: 6 (greater than 5)
- Respondent3: 6 (greater than 5)
- Respondent23: 6 (greater than 5)

The others have sums of 5 or less. 

So the respondents meeting the criteria are Respondent21, Respondent3, and Respondent23. Their identifiers are :Respondent21, :Respondent3, and :Respondent23. The answer should list their IDs without the colon, so 21, 3, 23. But wait, looking back at the data, the actual identifiers are written as :Respondent21, :Respondent3, etc. So the numbers are 21, 3, 23. However, in the example given in the problem, the answer was ""15"", which is just a number. The task here asks for a list of respondents, so the answer should be their numbers separated by commas. 

Wait, let me double-check each respondent's scores to ensure I didn't make a mistake. 

For Respondent21: 3 + 3 = 6 ✅  
Respondent3: 3 + 3 = 6 ✅  
Respondent23: 3 + 3 = 6 ✅  

Yes, those three have sums of 6, which is greater than 5. All others are 5 or below. 

So the final answer should be the list of their numbers: 21, 3, 23. But wait, in the data, the respondents are listed as :Respondent21, :Respondent3, :Respondent23. So their numbers are 21, 3, and 23. However, in the example provided, the answer was ""15"", which is a single number. But the task here is to list all respondents that meet the criteria, so the answer should be a comma-separated list of their identifiers. 

Therefore, the correct answer is 21, 3, 23.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents who scored 3 on 'Identification' and whose 'Comments' contain the word 'Overall'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The goal is to list all respondents who scored 3 on 'Identification' and have the word 'Overall' in their 'Comments'. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The 'Questions' section defines each field. The 'Identification' question uses a rubric where 3 means ""Introduces themselves and information is complete"". So I need to look for respondents with pred:Identification ""3"".

Next, the 'Comments' field is an open-ended question. The task requires that the comment contains the word 'Overall'. I need to check each respondent's Comments for that exact word, case-sensitive as per the data.

Now, looking at the 'Responses' section, I'll go through each respondent:

- **Respondent20**: Identification is 3. Comments: ""Good"" – no 'Overall'.
- **Respondent23**: Identification 3. Comments mention ""Time: ..."" and other details, but no 'Overall'.
- **Respondent8**: Identification 3. Comments: ""Clear communication... Good"" – no 'Overall'.
- **Respondent17**: Identification 3. Comments: ""Concise - clear, Satisfactory"" – no 'Overall'.
- **Respondent13**: Identification 3. Comments include ""Ventricular fibrillation..."" – no 'Overall'.
- **Respondent15**: Identification 3. Comments: ""Detailed Response - clear communication"" – no 'Overall'.
- **Respondent18**: Identification 3. Comments mention ""Not very concise..."" – no 'Overall'.
- **Respondent10**: Identification 2, so skip.
- **Respondent14**: Identification 3. Comments: ""Late response..."" – no 'Overall'.
- **Respondent16**: Identification 3. Comments: ""Consent denied..."" – no 'Overall'.
- **Respondent7**: Identification 3. Comments: ""Time: (1:00-1:17)"" – no 'Overall'.
- **Respondent5**: Identification 3. Comments: ""Good clear and precise clinical handover, Good"" – no 'Overall'.

After checking all, none of the respondents have 'Overall' in their Comments. Therefore, the answer is that there are no such respondents.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents who scored 1 on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and whose 'Comments' contain the word 'Clear'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The goal is to list all respondents who scored 1 on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and whose 'Comments' contain the word 'Clear'. 

First, I need to make sure I understand the data structure. The 'Recommendation_global_rating_scale' predicate corresponds to the question ""Global Rating Scale (GRS) - How confident am I that I received an accurate picture of the patient?"" with a rubric from 0 to 3. The score of 1 here means ""Confident but required extended questioning"".

Next, the 'Comments' field is an open-ended text response, and we need to check if it contains the word 'Clear' (case-sensitive as per the output rules, but maybe case-insensitive in the data? The example in the output rules says to preserve capitalization, but the data might have variations. However, the task says to look for the word 'Clear', so I should check for exact matches, but maybe case-insensitive? Wait, the output rules mention preserving capitalization as in the schema, but the task says ""contain the word 'Clear'"". Hmm, the user probably wants any case variation, but the data uses ""Clear"" and ""clear"" in comments. Let me check the data.

Looking at the responses:

- Respondent9's comment: ""Overall a bit unclear communication reflected"" – has 'unclear' which is different.
- Respondent15: ""Detailed Response - clear communication"" – 'clear' lowercase.
- Respondent17: ""Concise - clear"" – lowercase.
- Respondent3: ""Clear communication between Reg and colleague during handover"" – 'Clear' uppercase.
- Respondent19: ""Clarity is a bit low over whole case scenario"" – 'Clarity' but not 'clear'.
- Respondent4: ""Clinical handover and communication skills, satisfactory"" – no 'clear'.
- Respondent16: ""Satisfactory"" – no.
- Respondent20: ""Good"" – no.
- Respondent2: empty comment.
- Respondent23: ""Talking to registrav could not summarize the condition of patient very clearly"" – 'clearly' but not 'clear'.
- Respondent7: ""Time: (1:00-1:17)"" – no.
- Respondent21: ""Diagnostic clarity is present..."" – 'clarity' again.

So, the comments that have 'clear' (case-insensitive) are:

- Respondent3: ""Clear communication..."" (starts with uppercase)
- Respondent15: ""clear communication"" (lowercase)
- Respondent17: ""clear"" (lowercase)
- Respondent9: ""unclear"" (but that's a different word)
- Any others? Let me check again.

Wait, Respondent3's comment has ""Clear communication"", which includes 'Clear'. Respondent15's comment has ""clear communication"". Respondent17's comment has ""clear"". So those three have 'clear' in their comments, regardless of case. But the task says ""contain the word 'Clear'"". The output rules mention preserving capitalization, but the task instruction might be case-sensitive. However, in the data, the word is sometimes lowercase. The user might be looking for any occurrence of the substring 'clear' regardless of case. But the example given in the output rules for the MCQ shows that the answer is case-sensitive (e.g., output ""Abnormal"" if the schema has ""A. Abnormal""). So perhaps the task is case-insensitive, but the output should preserve the case as in the data. Wait, the task says ""Comments contain the word 'Clear'"". The quotes around 'Clear' might imply exact case, but in practice, comments might have variations. However, looking at the data:

- Respondent3's comment has ""Clear communication"" (capital C)
- Respondent15: ""clear communication"" (lowercase c)
- Respondent17: ""clear"" (lowercase)

So if the task is looking for the exact word 'Clear' with a capital C, then only Respondent3 would match. But that seems unlikely. The user probably wants any case. So perhaps the task is to check if the comment contains the substring 'clear' in any case. But the output rules say to preserve the exact capitalization. However, the task is to list the respondents, not the comments. So regardless of the case in the comment, as long as the word 'clear' appears in any case, the respondent should be included. 

But let's proceed. The main points are:

1. Find all respondents with pred:Recommendation_global_rating_scale ""1"".
2. Among those, check if their pred:Comments contain the word 'Clear' (case-insensitive?).

First, check which respondents have Recommendation_global_rating_scale of 1.

Looking through the responses:

- Respondent2: pred:Recommendation_global_rating_scale ""1"".
- Others: most have 2, 3, etc. Let's check each:

- Respondent20: 3
- Respondent2: 1
- Respondent23: 3
- Respondent4: 2
- Respondent7: 2
- Respondent19: 3
- Respondent9: 2
- Respondent3: 3
- Respondent16: 3
- Respondent21: 3
- Respondent15: 2
- Respondent17: 2

So only Respondent2 has a Recommendation_global_rating_scale of 1.

Now, check if Respondent2's Comments contain 'Clear'. Respondent2's comment is empty (pred:Comments """"). So no. Therefore, there are no respondents who meet both criteria. Wait, but that can't be right. Let me double-check.

Wait, the task is to find respondents who scored 1 on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and whose comments contain 'Clear'. So first, filter all respondents with pred:Recommendation_global_rating_scale ""1"". Only Respondent2. Then check their comments. Respondent2's comment is empty. So no match. Therefore, the answer should be zero? But that seems odd. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recheck all respondents' Recommendation_global_rating_scale:

Looking at each:

- :Respondent20: pred:Recommendation_global_rating_scale ""3""
- :Respondent2: ""1""
- :Respondent23: ""3""
- :Respondent4: ""2""
- :Respondent7: ""2""
- :Respondent19: ""3""
- :Respondent9: ""2""
- :Respondent3: ""3""
- :Respondent16: ""3""
- :Respondent21: ""3""
- :Respondent15: ""2""
- :Respondent17: ""2""

Yes, only Respondent2 has a score of 1. Now, check their comments. Respondent2's comment is empty. So no 'Clear' in comments. Therefore, no respondents meet both criteria. But the example in the previous answer had 15, but that was for a different question. Wait, the example was for a different task. So in this case, the answer would be that there are no such respondents. But maybe I missed someone. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I misread a respondent's Recommendation_global_rating_scale. Let me go through each again:

- Respondent20: 3
- Respondent2: 1
- Respondent23: 3
- Respondent4: 2
- Respondent7: 2
- Respondent19: 3
- Respondent9: 2
- Respondent3: 3
- Respondent16: 3
- Respondent21: 3
- Respondent15: 2
- Respondent17: 2

Yes, only Respondent2 has 1. So no one else. Therefore, the answer is that there are no respondents meeting both criteria. But maybe I made a mistake in the comments check. Let me check all respondents with 'Clear' in their comments, regardless of their rating scale score, to see if any have a rating scale of 1.

Looking at comments:

- Respondent3: ""Clear communication..."" – pred:Recommendation_global_rating_scale ""3""
- Respondent15: ""clear communication"" – pred:Recommendation_global_rating_scale ""2""
- Respondent17: ""clear"" – pred:Recommendation_global_rating_scale ""2""
- Respondent9: ""unclear"" – but that's a different word, and their rating is 2
- Respondent4: no 'clear'
- Respondent19: no
- Respondent16: no
- Respondent20: no
- Respondent23: no
- Respondent7: no
- Respondent21: no

So none of the respondents with 'clear' in their comments have a Recommendation_global_rating_scale of 1. Therefore, the answer is that there are no such respondents. But the example in the previous answer had 15, but that was for a different question. So in this case, the answer is zero. But the output rules say if the question asks for a list, provide a comma-separated list. If there are none, perhaps the answer is an empty list. But the example answer was ""15"", which is a number. Wait, the task says ""List all respondents..."", so the answer should be a list of their IDs. If none, then the answer is empty. But how to represent that? The output rules say for a list, provide a simple comma-separated list. If none, maybe output ""None"" or leave it empty. But the example answer was a number, but that was a count. Wait, the example question was ""List all respondents from sessions on '2025-05-04' who scored 3 on 'Situation'."" The answer was ""15"", which is the respondent number. Wait, looking back, in the example, the answer was ""15"", but in the data, the respondents on 2025-05-04 with Situation 3 are Respondent9, Respondent15, Respondent17. But the example answer was ""15"". Wait, that seems incorrect. Wait, in the example data, the respondents with Date ""2025-05-04"" are:

- Respondent9: 2025-05-04, Situation 3
- Respondent15: 2025-05-04, Situation 3
- Respondent17: 2025-05-04, Situation 3

So three respondents. But the example answer was ""15"". That's confusing. Wait, maybe the example answer was a typo. But regardless, in the current task, the answer is that there are no respondents meeting both criteria. Therefore, the answer is an empty list. But according to the output rules, if the question asks for a list, provide a simple comma-separated list. So if there are none, perhaps the answer is ""None"" or just an empty string. But the example answer was a number, which was incorrect. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the analysis. Let me check again.

Wait, let's re-express the task:

Find respondents where:

1. pred:Recommendation_global_rating_scale is ""1""
2. pred:Comments contains the word 'Clear' (case-sensitive?)

Looking at all respondents with pred:Recommendation_global_rating_scale ""1"":

Only Respondent2. Now, check their Comments. Respondent2's Comments are empty. So no 'Clear' there. Therefore, no respondents meet both criteria. So the answer is that there are none. Therefore, the output should be an empty list. But according to the output rules, if the question asks for a list, provide a comma-separated list. If there are none, perhaps the answer is ""None"" or just leave it blank. But the example in the previous task had a number, which might have been a mistake. Alternatively, maybe I missed a respondent. Let me check again.

Wait, let's check all respondents' Recommendation_global_rating_scale again:

- Respondent2: 1
- All others: 2,3, etc.

So only Respondent2. Comments: empty. So no. Therefore, the answer is that there are no respondents meeting both criteria. So the answer is an empty list. But how to represent that? The output rules say for a list, provide a simple comma-separated list. If there are none, perhaps the answer is ""None"" or just leave it as an empty string. But the example answer was ""15"", which was a single number. Maybe in this case, the answer is ""None"". But the user might expect a list of respondent numbers. Since there are none, the answer is an empty list. But according to the output rules, if the question asks for a list, provide a comma-separated list. So perhaps the answer is an empty string. But maybe the user expects ""None"" if there are no matches. However, the example answer in the previous task was ""15"", which is the respondent number. So in this case, since there are no respondents, the answer is empty. But how to represent that? Maybe just state that there are none, but according to the output rules, the answer should be the human-readable value. If it's a list, and there are none, perhaps the answer is ""None"". But the example didn't have that. Alternatively, maybe the answer is an empty string. But I need to follow the output rules strictly. The output rules say: ""If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"")"". So if there are none, the list is empty, so the answer is an empty string. But that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe the answer is ""No respondents found"". But the example answer was a number. Hmm. The example answer was ""15"", which was the respondent ID. So in this case, if there are no respondents, the answer is an empty string. But perhaps the correct answer is that there are no such respondents, so the answer is ""None"". But the output rules don't specify. However, given the example, which listed a single number, perhaps the answer is a list of respondent numbers. Since there are none, the answer is empty. But how to represent that. Maybe the answer is ""None"". But I'll proceed with that.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents who scored 3 on 'Identification' and whose 'Comments' contain the word 'Time'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The question is asking to list all respondents who scored 3 on 'Identification' and whose 'Comments' contain the word 'Time'. 

First, I need to understand what 'Identification' refers to. Looking at the questions section, the :QIdentification predicate has a rubric where a score of 3 means ""Introduces themselves and information is complete"". So I need to check each respondent's pred:Identification value.

Next, the 'Comments' field needs to include the word 'Time'. The Comments are open-ended, so I have to look for any instance where the comment text has ""Time"" in it, regardless of case, but the output should preserve the exact text. However, the data provided uses exact strings, so I need to check each respondent's pred:Comments for the presence of ""Time"".

Now, let's go through each respondent in the responses:

- **Respondent6**: pred:Identification is ""3"", but Comments are empty. No ""Time"" here.
- **Respondent1**: Identification is ""-1"", which doesn't meet the 3 score. Skip.
- **Respondent14**: Identification is ""3"". Comments mention ""Time: (2:36-2:53)..."". So this one has ""Time"" in comments. But wait, the task says ""contain the word 'Time'"". So Respondent14 qualifies.
- **Respondent15**: Identification is ""3"". Comments are ""Detailed Response - clear communication"". No ""Time"" here.
- **Respondent16**: Identification is ""3"". Comments mention ""Consent denied..."" and ""Satisfactory"". No ""Time"".
- **Respondent10**: Identification is ""2"". Doesn't meet the score. Skip.
- **Respondent2**: Identification is ""3"". Comments are empty. No.
- **Respondent8**: Identification is ""3"". Comments mention ""Clear communication..."" and ""Good"". No ""Time"".

Wait, but in the example given, the answer was 15. But according to the current data, Respondent14 and maybe others? Let me check again.

Wait, in the provided data, the example answer was 15, but that was for a different question (date 2025-05-04 and Situation score 3). Now the task is different. Let's focus on the current task.

Looking again:

- **Respondent14**: Identification is 3, Comments have ""Time: (2:36-2:53)..."". So this one should be included.
- **Respondent10**: Identification is 2, so no.
- Any others? Let me check all again.

Wait, Respondent10's Identification is 2, so no. Respondent14 is the only one with Identification 3 and Comments containing ""Time"". Are there others?

Wait, looking at the data again:

:Respondent10 a :Person ;
    pred:Date ""2025-03-14"" ;
    pred:SessionName ""(MI)-VT"" ;
    pred:Identification ""2"" ;
    pred:Situation ""2"" ;
    pred:Background_history ""2"" ;
    pred:Background_examination ""2"" ;
    pred:Assessment ""2"" ;
    pred:Recommendation_clear_recommendation ""2"" ;
    pred:Recommendation_global_rating_scale ""2"" ;
    pred:Comments ""Time: (15:53-16:14)""  .

Ah, here's Respondent10. Their Identification is 2, so they don't meet the score requirement. So even though their Comments have ""Time"", they are excluded because Identification is not 3.

So the only respondent that meets both criteria (Identification 3 and Comments with ""Time"") is Respondent14. But wait, in the data, Respondent14's pred:Comments are:

""Time: (2:36-2:53)
Late response for considering consultation""

So ""Time"" is present. And their Identification is 3. So Respondent14 should be the answer. But let me check if there are others.

Looking through all respondents again:

- Respondent6: No.
- Respondent1: No.
- Respondent14: Yes.
- Respondent15: No.
- Respondent16: No.
- Respondent10: No (score 2).
- Respondent2: No.
- Respondent8: No.

So the answer should be Respondent14. But the example in the problem had an answer of 15, but that was for a different question. So in this case, the correct answer is Respondent14. But wait, let me check the data again to confirm.

Yes, Respondent14 has Identification 3 and Comments with ""Time"". So the answer is 14. But wait, the example answer was 15, but that's for a different query. So in this task, the answer is 14.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondents have a total score for 'Background (history)' and 'Background (examination)' greater than 4?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find which respondents have a total score for 'Background (history)' and 'Background (examination)' greater than 4. 

First, I need to make sure I understand the data structure. The questions section defines each field. The 'Background_history' and 'Background_examination' are both scored on a rubric from 0 to 3. The total score would be the sum of these two for each respondent.

Looking at the responses, each respondent has values for pred:Background_history and pred:Background_examination. I need to add these two values for each person and check if the sum is greater than 4.

Let's go through each respondent:

- **Respondent23**: Background_history is 2, Background_examination is 2. Sum is 4. Not greater than 4.
- **Respondent10**: Both are 2. Sum 4. No.
- **Respondent15**: History 2, Exam 3. Sum 5. Yes.
- **Respondent3**: Both 3. Sum 6. Yes.
- **Respondent8**: History 3, Exam 2. Sum 5. Yes.
- **Respondent9**: Both 2. Sum 4. No.
- **Respondent7**: History 2, Exam 3. Sum 5. Yes.
- **Respondent14**: Both 2. Sum 4. No.
- **Respondent2**: History 2, Exam 3. Sum 5. Yes.
- **Respondent18**: Both 2. Sum 4. No.

Wait, but the data for Respondent3 shows pred:Background_history ""3"" and pred:Background_examination ""3"". So 3+3=6, which is greater than 4. Similarly, Respondent8 has 3+2=5, which is also over 4. Respondent15 has 2+3=5. Respondent7 has 2+3=5. Respondent2 has 2+3=5. 

So the respondents with sums over 4 are: Respondent15, Respondent3, Respondent8, Respondent7, Respondent2. Let me check again to make sure I didn't miss any.

Wait, looking back at the data:

- **Respondent3**: pred:Background_history ""3"", pred:Background_examination ""3"" → 6.
- **Respondent8**: 3 and 2 → 5.
- **Respondent15**: 2 and 3 → 5.
- **Respondent7**: 2 and 3 →5.
- **Respondent2**: 2 and 3 →5.

Yes, those are the ones. So the answer should be the list of these respondents: 15,3,8,7,2. But wait, the example answer in the initial data was 15, but that was for a different question. For this task, the correct respondents are 15,3,8,7,2. Let me check again each entry to confirm.

Wait, let me recheck each respondent's data:

- **Respondent3**: Yes, both 3s. Sum 6.
- **Respondent8**: 3 and 2. Sum 5.
- **Respondent15**: 2 and 3. Sum 5.
- **Respondent7**: 2 and 3. Sum 5.
- **Respondent2**: 2 and 3. Sum 5.

So the total is five respondents: 3,8,15,7,2. But the answer needs to be in a comma-separated list of their numbers. The order might not matter, but the example in the initial data had ""15"" as the answer, but that was for a different question. For this task, the correct respondents are 3,8,15,7,2. Let me check if I missed any others.

Wait, Respondent2's data: pred:Background_history ""2"", pred:Background_examination ""3"". Sum 5. Yes. So all these should be included. So the final list is 3,8,15,7,2. But let me check again each one to make sure I didn't make a mistake in reading the data.

Yes, all correct. So the answer is 3,8,15,7,2.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents who scored 3 on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and whose 'Comments' contain the word 'unclear'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The goal is to find all respondents who scored 3 on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and have the word 'unclear' in their Comments. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The 'Recommendation_clear_recommendation' predicate corresponds to the question about making a clear recommendation. The rubric for this question has a score of 3 meaning ""Clear comprehensive recommendation without questioning"". So I need to look for respondents where pred:Recommendation_clear_recommendation is ""3"".

Next, the Comments field needs to contain the word 'unclear'. The Comments are open-ended, so I have to check each respondent's Comments text for that exact word, case-sensitive as per the data provided.

Looking at the responses:

Starting with Respondent21: Their Recommendation_clear_recommendation is 3. Their comments mention ""Diagnostic clarity..."" and ""Good..."", no 'unclear' here. So they don't meet both criteria.

Respondent5: Recommendation_clear_recommendation is 2. So skip.

Respondent9: Recommendation_clear_recommendation is 3. Their Comments say ""Overall a bit unclear communication reflected"". The word 'unclear' is present. So this respondent qualifies.

Respondent22: Recommendation_clear_recommendation is 2. Skip.

Respondent3: Recommendation_clear_recommendation is 3. Their comments mention ""not oriented in TPP"" and ""Clear communication..."", no 'unclear'. So no.

Respondent2: Recommendation_clear_recommendation is 2. Skip.

Respondent6: Recommendation_clear_recommendation is 2. Skip.

Respondent10: Recommendation_clear_recommendation is 2. Skip.

Respondent16: Recommendation_clear_recommendation is 2. Skip.

So the only respondent that meets both conditions is Respondent9. Therefore, the answer should be Respondent9.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents who scored 2 on 'Assessment' and whose 'Comments' contain the word 'Clear'.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The goal is to list all respondents who scored 2 on 'Assessment' and whose 'Comments' contain the word 'Clear'. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The questions section defines each predicate. The 'Assessment' question is mapped to pred:Assessment, and the rubric for Assessment is: 0 = No logical assessment, 1 = Assessment only after extended questioning, 2 = Assessment after minimal questioning, 3 = Comprehensive logical assessment without questioning. So, we're looking for respondents with pred:Assessment ""2"".

Next, the 'Comments' field is an open-ended question (pred:Comments), and we need to check if the comment includes the word 'Clear' (case-sensitive as per the output rules). 

Now, I'll go through each respondent in the responses section and check these two conditions.

Starting with :Respondent10:
- pred:Assessment ""2"" → meets the first condition.
- Comments: ""Time: (15:53-16:14)"" → no 'Clear' here. So, exclude.

:Respondent15:
- Assessment is ""2"" → yes.
- Comments: ""Detailed Response - clear communication"" → 'clear' is present, but the output rules say to preserve capitalization. The comment has lowercase 'clear', but the task says to look for 'Clear' (with a capital C). Wait, the task says ""contain the word 'Clear'"". So case-sensitive? The output rules mention preserving capitalization as in the schema, but the task instruction might require exact match. However, in the data, the comment for Respondent15 has 'clear' lowercase. But the task says to look for 'Clear', so maybe case-insensitive? Wait, the output rules don't specify case sensitivity for the search, but the example given in the output rules for MCQ shows case preservation. Hmm. The task says ""contain the word 'Clear'"", which could be case-sensitive. Let me check the actual data.

Looking at the responses:

:Respondent15's comment is ""Detailed Response - clear communication"" → lowercase 'clear'.

:Respondent9's comment: ""Overall a bit unclear communication reflected"" → 'unclear' is different.

:Respondent22: ""Clear communication skills Good"" → starts with capital 'C'.

:Respondent8: ""Clear communication during handover Good"" → capital 'C'.

So, the task is to find comments containing 'Clear' (with capital C). But maybe the user intended case-insensitive. However, according to the output rules, when mapping MCQ, they preserve the schema's case, but for open-ended fields, output the exact text. The task says ""contain the word 'Clear'"", which is case-sensitive unless specified otherwise. So, perhaps only comments with 'Clear' (capitalized) count. Let's check each respondent.

Now, let's list all respondents with Assessment 2 and check their comments.

Respondent10: Assessment 2, comment no 'Clear' → exclude.

Respondent15: Assessment 2, comment has 'clear' lowercase → if case-sensitive, exclude. If case-insensitive, include. But the task says 'Clear', so maybe case-sensitive. Need to check.

But the output rules don't specify case sensitivity for the search, only for the output. The user's task is to find comments containing the word 'Clear', which is case-sensitive. So, only comments with 'Clear' (capital C) would count. Let's proceed under that assumption.

Next, :Respondent4: Assessment 2, comments: ""Clinical handover..."", no 'Clear' → exclude.

:Respondent22: Assessment 2? Wait, pred:Assessment ""2"" → yes. Comments: ""Clear communication skills..."" → has 'Clear' → meets both conditions. So include Respondent22.

:Respondent23: Assessment 3 → exclude.

:Respondent13: Assessment 2. Comments: ""Lack of communication..."" → no 'Clear' → exclude.

:Respondent9: Assessment 2. Comments: ""Overall a bit unclear..."" → 'unclear' is different. So no.

:Respondent16: Assessment 3 → exclude.

:Respondent8: Assessment 2. Comments: ""Clear communication during handover..."" → 'Clear' → meets both. Include Respondent8.

:Respondent2: Assessment 3 → exclude.

:Respondent19: Assessment 2. Comments: ""Clarity is a bit low..."" → 'Clarity' is different. So no.

:Respondent1: Assessment 3 → exclude.

Wait, let me double-check each:

- Respondent8: pred:Assessment ""2"" → yes. Comments: ""Clear communication during handover Good"" → 'Clear' → include.

- Respondent22: pred:Assessment ""2"" → yes. Comments: ""Clear communication skills..."" → include.

Any others?

Check Respondent15 again: if case-insensitive, 'clear' would count, but according to the task's wording, it's 'Clear' with a capital C. So if the comment has lowercase, it's excluded. So Respondent15 is excluded.

Similarly, Respondent9's comment has 'unclear' which is not 'Clear'.

So the respondents meeting both conditions are Respondent8 and Respondent22.

Wait, but let me check all again to be sure.

Looking at all respondents with Assessment 2:

- Respondent10: 2, comment no.

- Respondent15: 2, comment 'clear' lowercase.

- Respondent4: 2, comment no.

- Respondent22: 2, comment 'Clear'.

- Respondent13: 2, comment no.

- Respondent9: 2, comment 'unclear'.

- Respondent8: 2, comment 'Clear'.

So the correct answers are Respondent22 and Respondent8. But wait, looking back at the data:

Wait, :Respondent22's pred:Assessment is ""2""? Let me check:

:Respondent22 a :Person ;
    pred:Date ""2025-05-16"" ;
    pred:SessionName ""IV (VT)"" ;
    pred:Identification ""3"" ;
    pred:Situation ""3"" ;
    pred:Background_history ""3"" ;
    pred:Background_examination ""3"" ;
    pred:Assessment ""2"" ;
    pred:Recommendation_clear_recommendation ""2"" ;
    pred:Recommendation_global_rating_scale ""3"" ;
    pred:Comments ""Clear communication skills
Good""  .

Yes, Assessment is 2. Comments have 'Clear'.

:Respondent8 a :Person ;
    pred:Date ""2025-05-02"" ;
    pred:SessionName ""III (Sepsis)"" ;
    pred:Identification ""3"" ;
    pred:Situation ""3"" ;
    pred:Background_history ""3"" ;
    pred:Background_examination ""2"" ;
    pred:Assessment ""2"" ;
    pred:Recommendation_clear_recommendation ""2"" ;
    pred:Recommendation_global_rating_scale ""3"" ;
    pred:Comments ""Clear communication during handover
Good""  .

Yes, Assessment 2, Comments 'Clear'.

So both Respondent8 and Respondent22 meet the criteria. Are there any others?

Wait, :Respondent15's Assessment is 2, and comment has 'clear' lowercase. If the task is case-sensitive, then no. But maybe the task allows case-insensitive. The user's instruction says ""contain the word 'Clear'"". The exact wording in the task is important. If the task is case-sensitive, then only 'Clear' with capital C counts. If case-insensitive, then 'clear' would also count. The example given in the output rules for MCQ shows that the output should preserve the schema's case, but for open-ended fields, output the exact text. However, the task is to check if the comment contains the word 'Clear', which is case-sensitive unless specified. Since the user wrote 'Clear' in the task, perhaps they mean exact match. So Respondent15's comment has 'clear' lowercase, so it's excluded. Therefore, the correct respondents are 8 and 22.

Wait, but looking back at the data, :Respondent15's comment is ""Detailed Response - clear communication"". The word 'clear' is lowercase. So if the task requires 'Clear' with a capital C, then Respondent15 is excluded. If it's case-insensitive, then included. The task instruction doesn't specify case sensitivity, but the output rules mention preserving capitalization. However, the search term is 'Clear', so perhaps it's case-sensitive. Therefore, only respondents with 'Clear' in comments are included. So Respondent8 and 22.

But wait, let's check all the comments again:

Respondent8: ""Clear communication during handover"" → starts with 'Clear'.

Respondent22: ""Clear communication skills"" → 'Clear'.

Respondent15: 'clear' lowercase.

So the answer should be Respondent8 and Respondent22. But looking at the data, their IDs are :Respondent8 and :Respondent22. The answer should be a list of their IDs as numbers, comma-separated. So 8,22.

Wait, but in the data, the respondents are written as :Respondent8, which would be ID 8, and :Respondent22, ID 22. So the answer is ""8, 22"".

But let me check again to make sure I didn't miss any.

Another check:

- Respondent9: Assessment 2, comment ""Overall a bit unclear communication reflected"" → 'unclear' is not 'Clear'.

- Any other respondents with Assessment 2? Let's list all:

From the data:

Respondent10: 2

Respondent15: 2

Respondent4: 2

Respondent22: 2

Respondent13: 2

Respondent9: 2

Respondent8: 2

So those are the ones with Assessment 2. Now check their comments:

Respondent10: no 'Clear'.

Respondent15: 'clear' lowercase.

Respondent4: no.

Respondent22: 'Clear'.

Respondent13: no.

Respondent9: 'unclear'.

Respondent8: 'Clear'.

So only 8 and 22. Therefore, the answer is 8,22.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' is higher than the average 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' for all sessions on the same date.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The goal is to find all respondents whose 'Recommendation_clear_recommendation' score is higher than the average for all sessions on the same date. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The responses have a 'pred:Date' and a 'pred:Recommendation_clear_recommendation' value. Each respondent is identified by their URI, like :Respondent9, :Respondent17, etc. 

The plan is to:
1. Group all respondents by their date.
2. For each date, calculate the average Recommendation_clear_recommendation score.
3. Compare each respondent's score to their date's average.
4. Collect those respondents where their score is higher than the average.

Let me start by listing all respondents with their dates and Recommendation_clear_recommendation scores.

Looking at the data:

- :Respondent11: Date 2025-04-04, Score 3
- :Respondent20: 2025-05-02, 2
- :Respondent9: 2025-05-04, 3
- :Respondent1: 2025-05-02, 2
- :Respondent3: 2025-04-04, 3
- :Respondent8: 2025-05-02, 2
- :Respondent22: 2025-05-16, 2
- :Respondent21: 2025-05-16, 3
- :Respondent10: 2025-03-14, 2
- :Respondent17: 2025-05-04, 3
- :Respondent13: 2025-03-14, 2

Now, group by date:

2025-03-14: Respondents 10 and 13. Scores: 2 and 2. Average is (2+2)/2 = 2. So, any score above 2 here? Both are 2, so none.

2025-04-04: Respondents 11 and 3. Scores 3 and 3. Average is 3. So, no one above average.

2025-05-02: Respondents 20, 1, 8. Scores 2, 2, 2. Average is 2. All have 2, so none above.

2025-05-04: Respondents 9 and 17. Scores 3 and 3. Average is 3. No one above.

2025-05-16: Respondents 22 and 21. Scores 2 and 3. Average is (2+3)/2 = 2.5. So, Respondent21 has 3, which is higher than 2.5. So Respondent21 should be included.

Wait, but let me check each date again.

Wait, for 2025-05-16, the average is 2.5. So any respondent with a score higher than 2.5 would be included. Since scores are integers (0,1,2,3), the only one is Respondent21 with 3, which is higher than 2.5. So Respondent21 is a candidate.

Are there any other dates where the average is lower than a respondent's score?

Looking again:

2025-05-16: Average 2.5. Respondent21 has 3, which is higher. So include Respondent21.

Other dates:

2025-03-14: average 2, all scores 2. No.

2025-04-04: average 3, scores 3. No.

2025-05-02: average 2, scores 2. No.

2025-05-04: average 3, scores 3. No.

So the only respondent who meets the condition is Respondent21.

Wait, but let me check if there are any other dates. For example, Respondent22 is on 2025-05-16 with score 2, which is below the average of 2.5. So only Respondent21 in that date.

Therefore, the answer should be Respondent21.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'Identification' is higher than the average 'Identification' for all sessions on the same date.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find all respondents whose 'Identification' score is higher than the average 'Identification' score for all sessions on the same date. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The data includes multiple respondents, each with various attributes, including 'Date' and 'Identification' scores. The 'Identification' field is a rubric-based score from 0 to 3. 

The key steps here are:
1. Calculate the average 'Identification' score for each date.
2. For each respondent, compare their 'Identification' score to the average of their respective date.
3. List all respondents where their score is higher than the average for their date.

Let me start by extracting all the respondents along with their dates and Identification scores. 

Looking at the responses:

- Respondent16: Date 2025-05-02, Identification 3
- Respondent17: 2025-05-04, 3
- Respondent21: 2025-05-16, 3
- Respondent15: 2025-05-04, 3
- Respondent9: 2025-05-04, 3
- Respondent6: 2025-04-04, 3
- Respondent14: 2025-03-14, 3
- Respondent23: 2025-03-14, 3
- Respondent2: 2025-04-04, 3

Wait a minute, all respondents have an Identification score of 3 except none. Let me double-check. 

Looking through each:
- Respondent16: pred:Identification ""3""
- Respondent17: ""3""
- Respondent21: ""3""
- Respondent15: ""3""
- Respondent9: ""3""
- Respondent6: ""3""
- Respondent14: ""3""
- Respondent23: ""3""
- Respondent2: ""3""

So every single respondent has a score of 3 for Identification. That means the average for each date would also be 3, since all entries on each date have 3. 

For example, take date 2025-05-04. Respondents 17, 15, 9 all have 3. Average is (3+3+3)/3 = 3. So any respondent on that date would need a score higher than 3, but they all have exactly 3. Similarly, other dates: 2025-03-14 has two respondents (14 and 23) both with 3. Average is 3. 2025-04-04 has respondents 6 and 2, both 3. Average 3. 2025-05-02 has respondent16, average 3. 2025-05-16 has respondent21, average 3. 

Since all respondents have the same score as the average of their date, none have a score higher than the average. Therefore, the answer should be that there are no respondents meeting the criteria. 

But wait, the example given in the problem had an answer of 15. Let me check if I'm misunderstanding the question. The example asked for respondents on 2025-05-04 with Situation score 3, and the answer was 15 (along with 17, 9, 15). But in the current task, the question is different. 

But according to the current data, all Identification scores are 3. So the average for each date is 3. Therefore, no one has a higher score than the average. The answer should be an empty list. But maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again. 

Wait, perhaps I misread the data. Let me go through each respondent again:

- Respondent16: 3
- Respondent17: 3
- Respondent21: 3
- Respondent15: 3
- Respondent9: 3
- Respondent6: 3
- Respondent14: 3
- Respondent23: 3
- Respondent2: 3

Yes, all are 3. So the average for each date is 3. Therefore, no one is higher. The answer is none. But the output format says to provide a list. If there are none, perhaps the answer is an empty string or ""None"". But according to the output rules, if it's a list, maybe just leave it empty. However, the example answer was ""15"", which was a number. But in this case, since there are no such respondents, the answer should be that there are none. 

But wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the average. Let me check each date's average:

For 2025-03-14: Respondents14 and 23. Both have 3. Average is 3.

2025-04-04: Respondents6 and 2. Both 3. Average 3.

2025-05-02: Respondent16. Average 3.

2025-05-04: Respondents17,15,9. All 3. Average 3.

2025-05-16: Respondent21. Average 3.

So in all cases, the average is 3. Since all respondents have 3, none have a score higher than the average. Therefore, the answer is that there are no respondents meeting the criteria. 

But the output instructions say to provide a simple comma-separated list. If there are none, maybe the answer is an empty string. But perhaps the system expects ""None"" or just a blank. However, according to the output rules, if the task is to list names or IDs, provide a list. So in this case, since there are no such respondents, the answer is an empty list. But how to represent that? The example had ""15"" as the answer, which was a number. But here, since there are none, maybe the answer is ""None"" or just leave it empty. But the output rules say to provide the answer directly. 

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the data. Let me check again. Wait, the data for each respondent's Identification is ""3"". So all have 3. Therefore, no one is above average. So the answer is that there are no respondents. Therefore, the answer is an empty list. But according to the output format, if it's a list, provide a comma-separated list. So the answer would be an empty string. But perhaps the system expects ""None"" or ""No respondents"". However, the example answer was a number. But in the given data, there are no respondents with Identification higher than the average. So the answer is none. Therefore, the correct answer is that there are no respondents, so the output is empty. But how to represent that? The output rules say to provide the answer directly. If the task is to list IDs, and there are none, perhaps the answer is an empty string. But maybe the system expects ""None"" or ""No respondents found"". However, according to the output rules, for a list, it's a comma-separated list. So if there are none, the answer is an empty string. But perhaps the correct answer is that there are no such respondents. However, the user might expect a list of IDs. Since all have the same score as the average, none are higher. Therefore, the answer is that there are no respondents. So the final answer is an empty list, which would be represented as nothing. But according to the output rules, if it's a count, provide the number. But the task is to list respondents, so it's a list. Therefore, the answer is an empty list. But how to represent that? Maybe just leave it blank. But the example answer was ""15"", which was a number. But in this case, since there are no respondents, the answer is none. So the answer is: there are no respondents, so the output is empty. But the system might expect a specific format. Let me check the output rules again. 

The output rules state: ""If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"")"". Since the task is to list respondents, the answer should be a comma-separated list of their IDs. But in this case, there are none. So the answer is an empty string. However, the system might not accept that. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the data again. 

Wait, perhaps I misread the data. Let me check each respondent's Identification score again. 

Looking at each:

- :Respondent16 pred:Identification ""3"" 
- :Respondent17 pred:Identification ""3"" 
- :Respondent21 pred:Identification ""3"" 
- :Respondent15 pred:Identification ""3"" 
- :Respondent9 pred:Identification ""3"" 
- :Respondent6 pred:Identification ""3"" 
- :Respondent14 pred:Identification ""3"" 
- :Respondent23 pred:Identification ""3"" 
- :Respondent2 pred:Identification ""3"" 

Yes, all are 3. So the average for each date is 3, and no one is above. Therefore, the answer is that there are no respondents. So the output should be an empty list, which in the required format would be nothing. But how to represent that? The example answer was ""15"", which was a number. But in this case, since there are none, perhaps the answer is ""None"" or just leave it blank. However, according to the output instructions, if it's a list, provide a comma-separated list. If there are no items, perhaps the answer is an empty string. But the user might expect ""None"" or similar. However, the example answer was a number, but that was a different question. 

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again. For example, if a date has only one respondent, the average is their score. So if a respondent has 3, the average is 3. So they are not higher. Therefore, no one is higher. 

Therefore, the correct answer is that there are no respondents meeting the criteria. So the output is an empty list. But according to the output rules, the answer should be a comma-separated list. So the answer is an empty string. But perhaps the system expects ""None"". However, the example answer was a number. But in this case, the answer is that there are no respondents. So the answer is none. 

But how to represent that in the output. The output rules say: ""Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code."" So if there are no respondents, perhaps the answer is ""None"". But the example answer was a number. However, in this case, the answer is that there are no respondents. Therefore, the answer is ""None"". 

But I need to follow the output rules strictly. The task says to list all respondents, so if none, the answer is an empty list. But how to represent that. The example answer was ""15"", which was a single number, but that was a different question. 

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the data. Let me check again. Wait, perhaps there's a respondent with a higher score. Let me check all respondents again. 

No, all have 3. So the answer is none. Therefore, the answer is that there are no respondents. So the output is an empty string. But according to the output rules, if it's a list, provide a comma-separated list. So the answer is empty. But maybe the system expects ""None"". However, the example answer was a number. 

Alternatively, perhaps the system expects ""No respondents found"" or similar. But according to the output rules, the answer should be the human-readable value. If the task is to list IDs, and there are none, then the answer is ""None"". But the example answer was a number. 

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the data. Let me check once more. 

No, all Identification scores are 3. Therefore, the answer is that there are no respondents. So the output is empty. But how to represent that. The output rules don't specify, but the example answer was a number. However, in this case, the answer is that there are no respondents. Therefore, the answer is an empty list. So the final answer is nothing. But perhaps the system expects ""None"". 

Alternatively, maybe the answer is ""No respondents"" but according to the output rules, it should be a comma-separated list. So if there are none, the answer is an empty string. But the user might expect ""None"". 

But given the strict output rules, I think the correct answer is an empty list, which would be represented as an empty string. However, in the example, the answer was ""15"", which was a single ID. So in this case, since there are no respondents, the answer is empty. 

But the user might expect ""None"" or ""No respondents found"". But according to the output rules, the answer should be the human-readable value. If the task is to list IDs, and there are none, then the answer is ""None"". But the example answer was a number. 

Alternatively, maybe the answer is an empty string. But I need to follow the output rules. 

The output rules state: ""If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"")"". So if there are none, the answer is an empty string. 

Therefore, the final answer is an empty string. But how to represent that. The user might expect just a blank. But in the context of the assistant's answer, perhaps just state that there are none. However, the instructions say to provide the answer directly. 

But according to the output rules, the answer should be the human-readable value. If there are no respondents, the answer is ""None"". But the example answer was a number. 

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is ""No respondents found"". But the output rules don't specify. 

Given the ambiguity, but following the example where the answer was a number (e.g., ""15""), and in this case, since there are no respondents, the answer is an empty list. Therefore, the answer is an empty string. But perhaps the system expects ""None"". 

But to adhere strictly to the output rules, if the task is to list IDs and there are none, the answer is an empty string. However, in practice, it's better to state ""None"" to indicate no results. But the example answer was a number, not a word. 

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the data. Let me check once more. 

No, all Identification scores are 3. Therefore, the answer is that there are no respondents. So the answer is ""None"". 

But according to the output rules, if it's a list, provide a comma-separated list. If there are none, the answer is an empty string. But perhaps the system expects ""None"". 

In conclusion, after thorough analysis, there are no respondents whose 'Identification' score is higher than the average for their date. Therefore, the answer is none.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondents participated in a session where the average 'Assessment' for that session name is greater than 2.0?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find which respondents participated in a session where the average 'Assessment' score for that session name is greater than 2.0. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The 'Assessment' question is defined with a rubric where scores range from 0 to 3. Each respondent has a pred:Assessment value, which is their score for that question. The session name is given by pred:SessionName for each respondent.

The key here is to group respondents by their SessionName, calculate the average Assessment score for each group, and then find which respondents are in sessions where that average is above 2.0.

Let me start by listing all the respondents along with their SessionName and Assessment scores:

- Respondent12: Session ""II (Anaphylaxis)"", Assessment 2
- Respondent14: Session ""IV-Hypoglycemia"", Assessment 3
- Respondent11: Session ""IV (AF)"", Assessment 3
- Respondent21: Session ""I (Myocardial infarction)"", Assessment 2
- Respondent4: Session ""III (Sepsis)"", Assessment 2
- Respondent6: Session ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"", Assessment 2
- Respondent20: Session ""IV (VT)"", Assessment 3
- Respondent22: Session ""IV (VT)"", Assessment 2
- Respondent23: Session ""II-Anaphylaxsis"", Assessment 3
- Respondent8: Session ""III (Sepsis)"", Assessment 2
- Respondent5: Session ""II - Anaphylaxsis"", Assessment 3

Now, group them by SessionName:

1. II (Anaphylaxis): Respondent12 (2)
   - Average: 2.0 (only one respondent)
2. IV-Hypoglycemia: Respondent14 (3)
   - Average: 3.0
3. IV (AF): Respondent11 (3)
   - Average: 3.0
4. I (Myocardial infarction): Respondent21 (2)
   - Average: 2.0
5. III (Sepsis): Respondent4 (2), Respondent8 (2)
   - Average: (2 + 2)/2 = 2.0
6. II (Anaphylactic Shock): Respondent6 (2)
   - Average: 2.0
7. IV (VT): Respondent20 (3), Respondent22 (2)
   - Average: (3 + 2)/2 = 2.5
8. II-Anaphylaxsis: Respondent23 (3)
   - Average: 3.0
9. II - Anaphylaxsis: Respondent5 (3)
   - Average: 3.0

Wait, but some session names might be variations of the same session. For example, ""II (Anaphylaxis)"", ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"", ""II-Anaphylaxsis"", and ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" could be different ways of writing the same session. However, the data treats them as separate if the names don't exactly match. So I need to check if these are considered the same or different sessions.

Looking at the SessionNames:

- ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" (Respondent12)
- ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"" (Respondent6)
- ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" (Respondent23)
- ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" (Respondent5)

These are different session names as per the data provided. Even though they might refer to similar medical conditions, the session names are written differently, so they are treated as separate sessions. Similarly, ""IV-Hypoglycemia"" and ""IV (AF)"" are different sessions.

Now, calculate the average for each unique SessionName:

- IV-Hypoglycemia: 3.0 (average > 2.0)
- IV (AF): 3.0 (average > 2.0)
- IV (VT): 2.5 (average > 2.0)
- II-Anaphylaxsis: 3.0 (average > 2.0)
- II - Anaphylaxsis: 3.0 (average > 2.0)

The other sessions (II (Anaphylaxis), I (Myocardial infarction), III (Sepsis), II (Anaphylactic Shock)) have averages of 2.0 or less, so they don't qualify.

Now, list all respondents in the sessions where the average is above 2.0:

- IV-Hypoglycemia: Respondent14
- IV (AF): Respondent11
- IV (VT): Respondent20, Respondent22
- II-Anaphylaxsis: Respondent23
- II - Anaphylaxsis: Respondent5

So the respondents are 14, 11, 20, 22, 23, 5.

Wait, let me double-check:

IV (VT) has two respondents: 20 and 22. Their scores are 3 and 2. Average is (3+2)/2 = 2.5, which is above 2.0. Correct.

II-Anaphylaxsis: Respondent23 with 3. Average 3.0.

II - Anaphylaxsis: Respondent5 with 3. Average 3.0.

IV-Hypoglycemia: Respondent14 with 3. Average 3.0.

IV (AF): Respondent11 with 3. Average 3.0.

So the respondents are 14, 11, 20, 22, 23, 5. That's six respondents.

Wait, but in the example given, the answer was 15. But that was for a different question. Here, the answer should be the list of these respondents. Let me check again.

Wait, the example's answer was 15, but that's for a different query. The current task is different. So the answer here is the list of respondents in sessions where the average Assessment is >2.0. So the respondents are 14, 11, 20, 22, 23, 5. So the answer should be ""14, 11, 20, 22, 23, 5"" or ordered numerically? Let me check the order in the data. The respondents are listed as 12,14,11,21,4,6,20,22,23,8,5. So the order in the data isn't numerical, but the output should be a comma-separated list. The correct order would be to list them in numerical order: 5, 11,14,20,22,23. But the output format says to provide a simple comma-separated list, so perhaps the order doesn't matter as long as all are included. Let me confirm the sessions again.

Yes, the sessions with average >2.0 are:

- IV-Hypoglycemia (Respondent14)
- IV (AF) (Respondent11)
- IV (VT) (Respondent20, Respondent22)
- II-Anaphylaxsis (Respondent23)
- II - Anaphylaxsis (Respondent5)

So total of 6 respondents: 5,11,14,20,22,23.

Wait, but Respondent5 is in ""II - Anaphylaxsis"", which is a different session name from ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" (Respondent23). So they are separate sessions. Each has an average of 3.0. So both are included.

Therefore, the answer is 5,11,14,20,22,23.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'Background (examination)' is higher than the average 'Background (examination)' for all sessions on the same date.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find all respondents whose 'Background (examination)' score is higher than the average 'Background (examination)' for all sessions on the same date. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The 'Background_examination' predicate in the responses corresponds to the question labeled :QBackground_examination. The rubric for this question is a scale from 0 to 3. Each respondent has a 'Date' and a 'Background_examination' score.

The approach should be:

1. **Group respondents by date**: Because we need to calculate the average for each date separately.
2. **Calculate the average 'Background_examination' score for each date**: For all respondents on a given date, compute the average of their 'Background_examination' scores.
3. **Compare each respondent's score to their date's average**: For each respondent, check if their score is higher than the average of their group (date).

Let's start by listing all respondents with their dates and Background_examination scores:

- **Respondent18**: Date 2025-05-04, Score 2
- **Respondent2**: Date 2025-04-04, Score 3
- **Respondent15**: Date 2025-05-04, Score 3
- **Respondent3**: Date 2025-04-04, Score 3
- **Respondent11**: Date 2025-04-04, Score 3
- **Respondent9**: Date 2025-05-04, Score 2
- **Respondent19**: Date 2025-05-16, Score 3
- **Respondent4**: Date 2025-05-16, Score 2
- **Respondent13**: Date 2025-03-14, Score 1
- **Respondent7**: Date 2025-03-14, Score 3
- **Respondent23**: Date 2025-03-14, Score 2

Now, group them by date:

**2025-03-14**:
- Respondent13: 1
- Respondent7: 3
- Respondent23: 2
Total scores: 1 + 3 + 2 = 6. Average = 6 / 3 = 2.0

**2025-04-04**:
- Respondent2: 3
- Respondent3: 3
- Respondent11: 3
Total scores: 3 + 3 + 3 = 9. Average = 9 / 3 = 3.0

**2025-05-04**:
- Respondent18: 2
- Respondent15: 3
- Respondent9: 2
Total scores: 2 + 3 + 2 = 7. Average = 7 / 3 ≈ 2.33

**2025-05-16**:
- Respondent19: 3
- Respondent4: 2
Total scores: 3 + 2 = 5. Average = 5 / 2 = 2.5

Now, compare each respondent's score to their date's average:

- **Respondent18 (2025-05-04, 2)**: 2 vs 2.33 → 2 < 2.33 → No
- **Respondent2 (2025-04-04, 3)**: 3 vs 3 → 3 is not higher than 3 → No
- **Respondent15 (2025-05-04, 3)**: 3 > 2.33 → Yes
- **Respondent3 (2025-04-04, 3)**: 3 vs 3 → No
- **Respondent11 (2025-04-04, 3)**: 3 vs 3 → No
- **Respondent9 (2025-05-04, 2)**: 2 < 2.33 → No
- **Respondent19 (2025-05-16, 3)**: 3 > 2.5 → Yes
- **Respondent4 (2025-05-16, 2)**: 2 < 2.5 → No
- **Respondent13 (2025-03-14, 1)**: 1 < 2 → No
- **Respondent7 (2025-03-14, 3)**: 3 > 2 → Yes
- **Respondent23 (2025-03-14, 2)**: 2 = 2 → No

So the respondents with scores higher than their date's average are: Respondent15, Respondent19, and Respondent7. Their IDs are 15, 19, 7. But wait, let me check again:

Wait, Respondent7 is on 2025-03-14. The average for that date is 2.0. Respondent7's score is 3, which is higher. Correct. Respondent19 is on 2025-05-16, average 2.5, score 3. Correct. Respondent15 is on 2025-05-04, average ~2.33, score 3. Correct.

So the answer should be the list of these respondents: 7, 15, 19. But let me check the data again to ensure I didn't miss any.

Looking back:

- Respondent7: 3 on 2025-03-14 (average 2) → included.
- Respondent15: 3 on 2025-05-04 (average ~2.33) → included.
- Respondent19: 3 on 2025-05-16 (average 2.5) → included.

No others. So the final list is 7,15,19. But wait, the example answer in the initial data was 15. But that was for a different question. The current task is different. So the correct answer here is 7,15,19.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents who scored perfectly on 'Identification' and 'Background (history)' and whose 'Background (examination)' is below the average for all sessions.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to list all respondents who scored perfectly on 'Identification' and 'Background (history)' and whose 'Background (examination)' is below the average for all sessions. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The questions section defines each predicate. The 'Identification' corresponds to pred:Identification, which has a rubric where 3 means the respondent introduced themselves with complete information. Similarly, 'Background (history)' is pred:Background_history, where a score of 3 is a comprehensive focused history. 'Background (examination)' is pred:Background_examination, with 3 being comprehensive focused examination/observations.

So, the first part of the task requires respondents with a score of 3 on both Identification and Background_history. Let's go through each respondent in the data:

- Respondent22: Identification ""3"", Background_history ""3"" → meets the first criteria.
- Respondent18: Identification ""3"", Background_history ""2"" → doesn't meet Background_history.
- Respondent15: Identification ""3"", Background_history ""2"" → same as above.
- Respondent14: Identification ""3"", Background_history ""2"" → nope.
- Respondent2: Identification ""3"", Background_history ""2"" → no.
- Respondent7: Identification ""3"", Background_history ""2"" → no.
- Respondent17: Identification ""3"", Background_history ""3"" → meets first criteria.
- Respondent12: Identification ""3"", Background_history ""3"" → meets first criteria.

So the candidates after the first filter are Respondent22, Respondent17, and Respondent12.

Next, we need to check their Background_examination scores and ensure they are below the average of all sessions. 

First, calculate the average Background_examination score. Let's list all the Background_examination values:

- Respondent22: 3
- Respondent18: 2
- Respondent15: 3
- Respondent14: 2
- Respondent2: 3
- Respondent7: 3
- Respondent17: 3
- Respondent12: 3

Adding these up: 3 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 22. There are 8 respondents. Average is 22 / 8 = 2.75.

Now, the candidates from the first step are Respondent22, Respondent17, and Respondent12. Their Background_examination scores are all 3. But the average is 2.75. So 3 is above the average. Therefore, none of them have a Background_examination score below the average. 

Wait, that can't be right. Let me double-check the calculation. The sum is 3+2=5 (Respondent22 and 18), +3 (15) =8, +2 (14)=10, +3 (2)=13, +3 (7)=16, +3 (17)=19, +3 (12)=22. Yes, 22 total. 22 divided by 8 is 2.75. So the average is 2.75. Therefore, a score below average would be 2 or lower. 

But all three candidates (22,17,12) have a Background_examination of 3, which is above 2.75. Therefore, none of them meet the second condition. 

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake. Let me check each candidate again. 

Respondent22: Background_examination is 3. 3 is higher than 2.75 → doesn't meet the second condition.

Respondent17: Background_examination 3 → same.

Respondent12: Background_examination 3 → same.

So, there are no respondents who meet both criteria. But the example answer in the previous question was 15, but that's for a different query. Wait, the current task is different. 

Wait, but maybe I miscalculated the average. Let me recount the Background_examination scores:

Looking at all respondents:

- Respondent22: 3
- Respondent18: 2
- Respondent15:3
- Respondent14:2
- Respondent2:3
- Respondent7:3
- Respondent17:3
- Respondent12:3

Total: 3+2=5, +3=8, +2=10, +3=13, +3=16, +3=19, +3=22. Yes, 22. 22/8=2.75. So average is 2.75. So any score below that would be 2 or lower. 

But the candidates from the first step (those with Identification and Background_history both 3) are 22,17,12. All have Background_examination 3, which is above average. Therefore, none qualify. 

But that can't be. Maybe I missed a respondent. Let me check all respondents again for the first criteria:

Looking for Identification=3 and Background_history=3.

- Respondent22: yes.
- Respondent18: Background_history=2 → no.
- Respondent15: Background_history=2 → no.
- Respondent14: Background_history=2 → no.
- Respondent2: Background_history=2 → no.
- Respondent7: Background_history=2 → no.
- Respondent17: yes.
- Respondent12: yes.

So only those three. All have Background_examination=3. So their scores are above average. Therefore, the answer should be that there are no respondents meeting all criteria. But the output rules say to provide a list, so maybe the answer is an empty list. But the example answer in the previous task was ""15"", but that was for a different question. 

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the average calculation. Let me check again. The sum is 3 (22) +2 (18) +3 (15) +2 (14) +3 (2) +3 (7) +3 (17) +3 (12) = 3+2=5, +3=8, +2=10, +3=13, +3=16, +3=19, +3=22. 22 divided by 8 is indeed 2.75. So the average is 2.75. Therefore, any score below 2.75 is 2 or lower. 

But all three candidates have 3, which is above. Therefore, the answer is that there are no respondents meeting all the criteria. But the output format says to provide a list. If there are none, perhaps the answer is an empty list. But the output rules say ""provide a simple comma-separated list"". If there are none, maybe the answer is ""None"" or just empty. But according to the rules, if the task is to list names or IDs, provide a comma-separated list. So if no one meets the criteria, the answer would be an empty string. But maybe I missed something. 

Wait, let me check the data again. Are there any other respondents with Identification=3 and Background_history=3? Let's check each:

- Respondent22: yes.
- Respondent17: yes.
- Respondent12: yes.

No others. All three have Background_examination=3. So their scores are above the average of 2.75. Therefore, none qualify. So the answer is that there are no respondents meeting all the criteria. But the output format requires a list. So the answer would be an empty list. But the user might expect something else. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the average calculation. Let me check again. 

Wait, maybe I included all respondents, but the task says ""all sessions"". So all sessions include all the respondents. So the average is correct. 

Alternatively, perhaps the average is calculated as the mean of all Background_examination scores, which is 2.75, so scores below that are 2 or lower. Therefore, the three candidates (22,17,12) have 3, which is above. So no one qualifies. 

Therefore, the answer is that there are no such respondents. But according to the output rules, if the question asks for a list, provide a comma-separated list. If there are none, perhaps the answer is an empty string. But maybe I made a mistake. Let me check once more. 

Alternatively, perhaps I miscalculated the average. Let me sum again:

3 (22) +2 (18) +3 (15) +2 (14) +3 (2) +3 (7) +3 (17) +3 (12) 

Adding step by step:

22:3 → total 3

18:2 → total 5

15:3 → 8

14:2 →10

2:3 →13

7:3 →16

17:3 →19

12:3 →22

Total 22. 8 respondents. 22/8=2.75. Correct. 

So the answer is that there are no respondents who meet all the criteria. Therefore, the output is an empty list. But the output rules say to provide a list. So the answer is nothing, but according to the rules, maybe just leave it blank. However, the example answer in the previous task was ""15"", which was a number. But in this case, the answer is zero. But the output format says for a count, provide the number, for a list, provide the list. The task says ""list all respondents"", so the answer should be a list of their IDs. Since none meet the criteria, the answer is an empty list. But how to represent that? Maybe the answer is ""None"" or just leave it blank. But according to the output rules, if it's a list, provide a comma-separated list. If there are none, perhaps the answer is an empty string. But the user might expect ""None"" or ""No respondents"". However, the example in the previous task had a numerical answer. 

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the task. Let me re-read the task:

""List all respondents who scored perfectly on 'Identification' and 'Background (history)' and whose 'Background (examination)' is below the average for all sessions.""

So, the steps are:

1. Find respondents with Identification=3 and Background_history=3.

2. For those respondents, check if their Background_examination is below the average of all Background_examination scores.

So, the average is 2.75. Therefore, Background_examination must be less than 2.75. Since the scores are integers (0,1,2,3), the possible scores below 2.75 are 0,1,2. 

The three candidates (22,17,12) have Background_examination=3, which is above 2.75. Therefore, none qualify. 

Thus, the answer is that there are no such respondents. But according to the output format, if the task is to list names or IDs, provide a comma-separated list. If there are none, perhaps the answer is an empty string. However, the user might expect ""None"" or similar. But the example answer in the previous task was a number. 

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the average calculation. Let me check once more. 

Total sum: 22. 8 respondents. 22/8=2.75. Correct. 

Therefore, the answer is that there are no respondents meeting all the criteria. So the output is an empty list. But how to represent that? The output rules say to provide a simple comma-separated list. If there are none, perhaps the answer is an empty string. But maybe the user expects ""None"". However, according to the output rules, if the question asks for a list, provide the list. If there are none, perhaps the answer is nothing. But in the example, the answer was ""15"", which was a count, but here it's a list. 

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the first step. Let me check again the respondents with Identification=3 and Background_history=3. 

Looking at each respondent:

- Respondent22: Identification ""3"", Background_history ""3"" → yes.

- Respondent18: Background_history ""2"" → no.

- Respondent15: Background_history ""2"" → no.

- Respondent14: Background_history ""2"" → no.

- Respondent2: Background_history ""2"" → no.

- Respondent7: Background_history ""2"" → no.

- Respondent17: Background_history ""3"" → yes.

- Respondent12: Background_history ""3"" → yes.

So three respondents: 22,17,12. All have Background_examination=3. Which is above average. Therefore, none meet the criteria. 

So the answer is that there are no respondents. Therefore, the output is an empty list. But according to the output rules, for a list, provide a comma-separated list. If there are none, perhaps the answer is an empty string. But maybe the system expects ""None"". However, the example answer was a number. 

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the data. Let me check the data again. 

Looking at Respondent12: pred:Background_history ""3"" → yes. pred:Background_examination ""3"" → yes. 

So all three have Background_examination=3. 

Therefore, the answer is that there are no respondents meeting all the criteria. So the output is an empty list. But how to represent that? The output instructions say to provide a simple comma-separated list. If there are none, perhaps the answer is an empty string. But maybe the user expects ""None"". However, the example answer was a number. 

Alternatively, maybe the average is calculated incorrectly. Let me check again. 

Total sum of Background_examination: 3+2+3+2+3+3+3+3=22. 22/8=2.75. Correct. 

Therefore, the answer is that there are no respondents. So the output is an empty list. But according to the output rules, the answer should be a comma-separated list. So the answer is nothing. But perhaps the correct answer is that there are no respondents, so the output is empty. However, the user might expect a different approach. 

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the task. The task says ""Background (examination)"" is below the average for all sessions. So the average is calculated across all sessions, not just the ones that meet the first two criteria. Which is what I did. 

Yes, that's correct. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that there are no respondents meeting all the criteria. So the answer is an empty list. But how to present that. The output rules say for a list, provide a comma-separated list. If there are none, perhaps the answer is an empty string. But maybe the system expects ""None"". However, the example answer was a number. 

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the data. Let me check the data again. 

Wait, looking at Respondent12: pred:Background_history ""3"" and pred:Background_examination ""3"". 

Yes. 

So, the answer is that there are no respondents. Therefore, the output is an empty list. But according to the output rules, the answer should be a comma-separated list. So the answer is nothing. But maybe the user expects ""None"". However, the example answer was ""15"" which was a count. 

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is ""None"". But according to the output rules, for a list, provide a comma-separated list. If there are none, perhaps the answer is an empty string. But the user might expect ""None"". However, the example answer in the previous task was a number. 

In any case, based on the analysis, there are no respondents meeting all the criteria. Therefore, the answer is an empty list. So the final answer is nothing. But since the output requires a response, perhaps the answer is ""None"".

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents who scored perfectly on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and whose 'Background (history)' is below the average for all sessions.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The goal is to list all respondents who meet three criteria: they scored perfectly on both 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)', and their 'Background (history)' score is below the average of all sessions.

First, I need to understand what each of these terms refers to in the data. Let's look at the questions schema to clarify the predicates. 

The 'Recommendation_clear_recommendation' has a rubric where 3 is the highest score, meaning ""Clear comprehensive recommendation without questioning"". Similarly, 'Recommendation_global_rating_scale' at 3 means ""Confident and required little or no questioning"". So a perfect score on both would be a 3 for each.

Next, the 'Background_history' is scored from 0 to 3, with 3 being the best. The task requires this score to be below the average of all sessions. So I need to calculate the average of all 'Background_history' scores first.

Let's start by going through each respondent and extracting their scores for these three fields. 

Looking at the responses:

- Respondent16: 
  - Recommendation_clear_recommendation: 2
  - Recommendation_global_rating_scale: 3
  - Background_history: 3

- Respondent21:
  - Clear: 3, GRS:3, Background_history:3

- Respondent15:
  - Clear:2, GRS:2, Background_history:2

- Respondent2:
  - Clear:2, GRS:1, Background_history:2

- Respondent7:
  - Clear:2, GRS:2, Background_history:2

- Respondent9:
  - Clear:3, GRS:2, Background_history:2

- Respondent5:
  - Clear:2, GRS:3, Background_history:3

- Respondent10:
  - Clear:2, GRS:2, Background_history:2

- Respondent8:
  - Clear:2, GRS:3, Background_history:3

- Respondent12:
  - Clear:3, GRS:3, Background_history:3

- Respondent22:
  - Clear:2, GRS:3, Background_history:3

- Respondent20:
  - Clear:2, GRS:3, Background_history:2

Now, the first part: respondents with perfect scores (3) on both Recommendation_clear_recommendation and Recommendation_global_rating_scale. Let's check each:

- Respondent21: Clear is 3, GRS is 3. So yes.
- Respondent12: Both 3. Yes.
- Others: Either one or both are less than 3. For example, Respondent5 has GRS 3 but Clear 2. Respondent20 has GRS 3 but Clear 2. Respondent16 has GRS 3 but Clear 2. So only Respondent21 and 12 meet the first two criteria.

Next, calculate the average Background_history score across all sessions. Let's list all Background_history scores:

Scores:
3 (16), 3 (21), 2 (15), 2 (2), 2 (7), 2 (9), 3 (5), 2 (10), 3 (8), 3 (12), 3 (22), 2 (20).

Adding these up: 3+3=6, +2=8, +2=10, +2=12, +2=14, +3=17, +2=19, +3=22, +3=25, +3=28, +2=30. Total sum is 30. Number of respondents is 12. Average is 30/12 = 2.5.

So the average Background_history score is 2.5. We need respondents whose Background_history is below this average, i.e., scores below 2.5. Since the scores are integers (0,1,2,3), scores of 2 or lower are below 2.5. Wait, 2 is less than 2.5, so scores of 0,1,2 would be below average. But looking at the data, the possible scores here are 2 and 3. So any respondent with Background_history 2 or lower would qualify. But in our data, the lowest is 2 (since all have 2 or 3 except maybe someone? Let me check again.

Looking at the list:

Respondent16: 3
Respondent21:3
Respondent15:2
Respondent2:2
Respondent7:2
Respondent9:2
Respondent5:3
Respondent10:2
Respondent8:3
Respondent12:3
Respondent22:3
Respondent20:2

So all Background_history scores are either 2 or 3. The average is 2.5. So scores below average are 2. So any respondent with Background_history 2.

Now, the two respondents who met the first two criteria (perfect scores on both recommendations) are Respondent21 and 12. Let's check their Background_history:

- Respondent21: Background_history is 3, which is above average. So they don't meet the third criterion.
- Respondent12: Background_history is 3, also above average. So they are excluded.

Wait, that's a problem. So none of the respondents who have both recommendations at 3 have Background_history below 2.5. So maybe there are no respondents meeting all three criteria?

But wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again.

Wait, the task says ""scored perfectly on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)'"". So both need to be 3. Let's recheck all respondents:

Looking again:

- Respondent21: Clear:3, GRS:3. Background_history:3 (above average)
- Respondent12: Clear:3, GRS:3. Background_history:3 (above average)
- Any others? Let's check:

Respondent5: Clear:2, GRS:3. No.
Respondent16: Clear:2, GRS:3. No.
Respondent8: Clear:2, GRS:3. No.
Respondent22: Clear:2, GRS:3. No.
Respondent20: Clear:2, GRS:3. No.

So only 21 and 12 have both recommendations at 3, but their Background_history is 3, which is above average. Therefore, there are no respondents who meet all three criteria. But the example answer in the previous task was 15, but that's for a different question. Wait, the current task is different. So perhaps the answer is that there are no such respondents. But let me check again.

Wait, maybe I missed someone. Let me go through each respondent again:

- Respondent16: Clear:2, GRS:3 → no
- Respondent21: Clear:3, GRS:3 → yes, but Background_history:3 (not below average)
- Respondent15: Clear:2, GRS:2 → no
- Respondent2: Clear:2, GRS:1 → no
- Respondent7: Clear:2, GRS:2 → no
- Respondent9: Clear:3, GRS:2 → GRS not 3 → no
- Respondent5: Clear:2, GRS:3 → Clear not 3 → no
- Respondent10: Clear:2, GRS:2 → no
- Respondent8: Clear:2, GRS:3 → Clear not 3 → no
- Respondent12: Clear:3, GRS:3 → Background_history:3 → no
- Respondent22: Clear:2, GRS:3 → no
- Respondent20: Clear:2, GRS:3 → no

So indeed, no respondents meet all three criteria. But the task says to list them. So the answer would be none. But maybe I made a mistake in calculating the average. Let's recalculate the average.

Total sum of Background_history: 

Respondent16:3
21:3
15:2
2:2
7:2
9:2
5:3
10:2
8:3
12:3
22:3
20:2

Adding these: 3+3=6, +2=8, +2=10, +2=12, +2=14, +3=17, +2=19, +3=22, +3=25, +3=28, +2=30. Total 30. 12 respondents. 30/12=2.5. Correct.

So the average is 2.5. Therefore, Background_history must be below 2.5, which is 2 or lower. But all respondents with both recommendations at 3 have Background_history 3. So no one qualifies. Therefore, the answer is that there are no such respondents. But the output format says to provide a list, so maybe the answer is an empty list. But the example answer was 15, but that was for a different question. So in this case, the answer is none. But let me check again if I missed any respondents.

Wait, Respondent9 has Clear:3, GRS:2. So GRS is 2, which is not perfect. So no. Respondent12 and 21 are the only ones with both at 3, but their Background_history is 3. So no one meets all three criteria. Therefore, the answer is that there are no respondents meeting all the conditions. But the output format requires a list. If there are none, perhaps the answer is an empty list. But the user might expect a list of IDs. So the answer is none, so the output is empty. But let me check again.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the predicates. Let me confirm the predicates again.

The 'Recommendation_clear_recommendation' is mapped to ""Makes a clear recommendation. [Rubric: 0 = No recommendation, 1 = Clear recommendation only after extended questioning, 2 = Clear recommendation after minimal questioning, 3 = Clear comprehensive recommendation without questioning]"".

'Recommendation_global_rating_scale' is ""Global Rating Scale (GRS) - How confident am I that I received an accurate picture of the patient? [Rubric: 0 = Not at all confident, 1 = Confident but required extended questioning, 2 = Confident but required some further questioning, 3 = Confident and required little or no questioning]"".

So perfect scores are 3 for both. Correct.

Background_history: ""Gives appropriate history. [Rubric: 0 = History is unstructured or non-relevant, 1 = Relevant history but frequent clarification needed, 2 = Relevant history with few further questions needed, 3 = Comprehensive focused history]"".

Average is 2.5, so scores below that are 0,1,2. But in the data, the lowest is 2. So any respondent with Background_history 2 would be below average. But the two respondents with both recommendations at 3 have Background_history 3. So no one qualifies. Therefore, the answer is that there are no respondents meeting all three criteria. So the output should be an empty list. But the output format says to list names or IDs as a comma-separated list. So the answer is none, hence no IDs. But perhaps I missed someone. Let me check once more.

Wait, Respondent20 has Background_history 2. But their recommendations: Clear is 2, GRS is 3. So they don't have both at 3. Respondent9 has Clear 3, GRS 2. So no. Respondent12 and 21 are the only ones with both at 3, but their Background_history is 3. So no. Therefore, the answer is that there are no respondents meeting all three criteria. So the output is an empty list. But the system might expect at least a ""None"" or similar. However, according to the output rules, if it's a list, provide a comma-separated list. If none, perhaps just leave it blank. But the example answer in the previous task was ""15"", which is a single ID. So in this case, the answer is no one, so the output is empty. But maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again.

Alternatively, perhaps I miscalculated the average. Let me recount the sum. The sum is 3 (16) +3 (21) +2 (15) +2 (2) +2 (7) +2 (9) +3 (5) +2 (10) +3 (8) +3 (12) +3 (22) +2 (20) = 3+3=6, +2=8, +2=10, +2=12, +2=14, +3=17, +2=19, +3=22, +3=25, +3=28, +2=30. Yes, 30. 30/12=2.5. Correct.

So the conclusion is that there are no respondents who meet all three criteria. Therefore, the answer is an empty list. But the output format says to provide a simple comma-separated list. So the answer is nothing, but perhaps the system expects ""None"" or similar. However, according to the rules, if the task is to list names or IDs, and there are none, then the answer is an empty string. But maybe I should check if there's any respondent I missed. Let me check once more.

Wait, Respondent12: pred:Recommendation_clear_recommendation ""3"" ; pred:Recommendation_global_rating_scale ""3"" ; pred:Background_history ""3"". So both recommendations are 3, but Background_history is 3, which is above average. So no. Respondent21: same. No others. So the answer is that there are no such respondents. Therefore, the output is empty. But the user might expect a ""None"" or ""No respondents found"". However, according to the output rules, for a list, provide a comma-separated list. If there are none, perhaps just leave it blank. But maybe the answer is an empty string. However, in the example, the answer was ""15"", which is a number. But this task is different. So the answer is that there are no respondents, so the output is empty. But perhaps the user expects a 0 or something. But according to the output rules, if it's a count, provide the number. But the task says to list respondents, which is a list. So the answer is an empty list. Therefore, the final answer is nothing. But maybe I should write ""No respondents found"" or similar, but according to the output rules, for a list, it's a comma-separated list. So the answer is an empty string. But the system might not accept that. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the criteria. Let me check again.

Wait, the task says ""scored perfectly on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)'"". So both need to be 3. Then, Background_history must be below the average. The average is 2.5, so Background_history must be 2 or lower. But all respondents with both recommendations at 3 have Background_history 3. Therefore, no one qualifies. So the answer is no respondents. Hence, the output is empty. But how to represent that? According to the output rules, if the task is to list names or IDs, provide a comma-separated list. If none, perhaps just leave it blank. But maybe the answer is ""None"". However, the example answer was a number. But in this case, since it's a list, the answer is an empty list. So the final answer is nothing, but according to the output rules, perhaps just leave it as an empty string. But maybe the system expects a specific format. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check once more.

No, I think the analysis is correct. Therefore, the answer is that there are no respondents meeting all three criteria. So the output is empty. But since the user might expect a list, perhaps the answer is an empty string. However, in the example, the answer was ""15"", which is a single ID. So maybe in this case, the answer is an empty list, which would be represented as nothing. But the user might need to see that. So the final answer is that there are no such respondents, so the output is empty.
</think>

The respondents must have both 'Recommendation_clear_recommendation' and 'Recommendation_global_rating_scale' scores of 3 (perfect) and a 'Background_history' score below the average (2.5). 

Calculating the average 'Background_history' score across all sessions:  
Total sum = 3+3+2+2+2+2+3+2+3+3+3+2 = 30  
Average = 30 / 12 = 2.5  

Respondents with perfect recommendation scores (3 on both):  
- **:Respondent21** (Background_history = 3 → above average)  
- **:Respondent12** (Background_history = 3 → above average)  

No respondents meet all three criteria.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'Background (history)' is higher than the average 'Background (history)' for all sessions on the same date.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find all respondents whose 'Background (history)' score is higher than the average 'Background (history)' for all sessions on the same date. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The 'Background_history' predicate in the responses corresponds to the question :QBackground_history, which is about the respondent's ability to give appropriate history. The scores are numerical, ranging from 0 to 3. 

So, the plan is:
1. For each respondent, note their 'Background_history' score and the date of their session.
2. For each date, calculate the average 'Background_history' score of all respondents on that date.
3. Compare each respondent's score to the average of their respective date.
4. List all respondents where their score is higher than the average for their date.

Let's start by extracting all the respondents with their dates and Background_history scores.

Looking at the responses:

- Respondent21: Date 2025-05-16, Background_history 3
- Respondent20: 2025-05-02, 2
- Respondent8: 2025-05-02, 3
- Respondent6: 2025-04-04, 3
- Respondent10: 2025-03-14, 2
- Respondent18: 2025-05-04, 2
- Respondent1: 2025-05-02, 2
- Respondent14: 2025-03-14, 2

Now, group them by date and calculate averages.

Starting with 2025-03-14:
Respondents: 10 and 14. Both have scores 2. Average is (2 + 2)/2 = 2. So, no one here has a score higher than 2.

2025-04-04:
Only Respondent6 with score 3. Average is 3. So, 3 is not higher than 3. So, no one here.

2025-05-02:
Respondents: 20 (2), 8 (3), 1 (2). Scores are 2,3,2. Sum is 7, average 7/3 ≈ 2.333. So, average is ~2.33. Respondents with scores higher than 2.33 are Respondent8 (3). So Respondent8 is included.

2025-05-04:
Only Respondent18 with score 2. Average is 2. So, no one.

2025-05-16:
Only Respondent21 with score 3. Average is 3. So, no one.

So the only respondent whose Background_history score is higher than the average for their date is Respondent8.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents who scored perfectly on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 'Situation' and whose 'Identification' is below the average for all sessions.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The goal is to list all respondents who meet three criteria: they scored perfectly on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 'Situation', and their 'Identification' score is below the average for all sessions.

First, I need to understand what each of these terms means based on the provided schema. 

Starting with the 'Recommendation (global rating scale)'. Looking at the questions section, the predicate is QRecommendation_global_rating_scale. The rubric says it's a scale from 0 to 3, where 3 means ""Confident and required little or no questioning"". A perfect score here would be 3.

Next, 'Situation' corresponds to QSituation. The rubric here also goes up to 3, with 3 meaning ""Identifies and prioritizes the main problem(s) unprompted"". So a perfect score here is 3 as well.

Then, 'Identification' is under QIdentification. The rubric here is 0-3, with 3 being the highest. The task says the respondent's Identification score must be below the average for all sessions. So I need to calculate the average Identification score across all respondents and then find those who scored below that average.

Let's start by collecting all the Identification scores. Looking at each respondent:

- Respondent8: Identification ""3""
- Respondent4: ""3""
- Respondent15: ""3""
- Respondent22: ""3""
- Respondent5: ""3""
- Respondent16: ""3""
- Respondent10: ""2""
- Respondent9: ""3""

Adding these up: 3+3+3+3+3+3+2+3 = 23. There are 8 respondents. The average is 23/8 = 2.875. So the average Identification score is approximately 2.875. Therefore, respondents with Identification scores below 2.875 are those who scored 2 or lower. Looking at the list, only Respondent10 has a score of 2. All others have 3.

Now, check which respondents have both 'Recommendation_global_rating_scale' and 'Situation' scores of 3, and Identification below 2.875.

Looking at each respondent:

- Respondent8: 
  - Recommendation_global_rating_scale: 3
  - Situation: 3
  - Identification: 3 → 3 is not below 2.875. So exclude.

- Respondent4:
  - Recommendation_global_rating_scale: 2
  - Situation: 3
  → Doesn't meet the perfect score on global rating (needs 3). Exclude.

- Respondent15:
  - Recommendation_global_rating_scale: 2
  - Situation: 3
  → Global rating is 2, not 3. Exclude.

- Respondent22:
  - Recommendation_global_rating_scale: 3
  - Situation: 3
  - Identification: 3 → Again, 3 is not below average. Exclude.

- Respondent5:
  - Recommendation_global_rating_scale: 3
  - Situation: 3
  - Identification: 3 → Exclude.

- Respondent16:
  - Recommendation_global_rating_scale: 3
  - Situation: 3
  - Identification: 3 → Exclude.

- Respondent10:
  - Recommendation_global_rating_scale: 2
  - Situation: 2
  → Doesn't meet the perfect scores. Exclude.

- Respondent9:
  - Recommendation_global_rating_scale: 2
  - Situation: 3
  → Global rating is 2, not 3. Exclude.

Wait, none of the respondents have both global rating and situation at 3, and identification below 2.875. But let me double-check. 

Wait, the average Identification is 2.875, so scores below that are 2 or lower. Only Respondent10 has Identification 2, but their Situation is 2 and global rating is 2. So they don't meet the other criteria. All others with Situation 3 and global rating 3 have Identification 3, which is above the average. 

So according to this analysis, there are no respondents who meet all three criteria. But that can't be right. Let me check again.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the average. Let's recalculate the sum of Identification scores. The respondents are 8 in total. The scores are: 3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3. That's seven 3s and one 2. 7*3=21 +2=23. 23/8=2.875. Correct. So the average is indeed 2.875. So Identification must be below that, which is 2 or lower. Only Respondent10 has 2, but their other scores don't meet the criteria. 

Therefore, there are no respondents that satisfy all three conditions. But the example given in the problem had an answer, but maybe the example is different. Wait, the example was a different question. The current task is different. So according to the data provided, there are no respondents who meet all three criteria. But let me check again.

Wait, let's check each respondent again for the three conditions:

1. Recommendation_global_rating_scale = 3
2. Situation = 3
3. Identification < 2.875 (i.e., <=2)

Looking at each:

- Respondent8: global 3, situation 3, ID 3 → ID not below average. Exclude.
- Respondent4: global 2, situation 3 → global not 3. Exclude.
- Respondent15: global 2, situation 3 → global not 3. Exclude.
- Respondent22: global 3, situation 3, ID 3 → Exclude.
- Respondent5: global 3, situation 3, ID 3 → Exclude.
- Respondent16: global 3, situation 3, ID 3 → Exclude.
- Respondent10: global 2, situation 2 → Exclude.
- Respondent9: global 2, situation 3 → global not 3. Exclude.

So none of the respondents meet all three criteria. Therefore, the answer should be that there are no such respondents, but the output format says to provide a list. However, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the 'Recommendation_global_rating_scale'? Let me check the schema again.

The 'Recommendation_global_rating_scale' is defined as: ""Global Rating Scale (GRS) - How confident am I that I received an accurate picture of the patient? [Rubric: 0 = Not at all confident, 1 = Confident but required extended questioning, 2 = Confident but required some further questioning, 3 = Confident and required little or no questioning]"". So a perfect score is 3.

Looking at the respondents, those with global rating 3 are: Respondent8, Respondent22, Respondent5, Respondent16. All of them have Identification 3, which is above the average. So none of them have Identification below 2.875. Therefore, the answer is that there are no respondents meeting all three criteria. But the output instructions say to list them, so maybe the answer is an empty list. However, the example answer was ""15"", but that was for a different question. 

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the average calculation. Let me check again. The sum is 23, divided by 8 respondents: 23/8=2.875. So the average is 2.875. Therefore, any Identification score less than 2.875 would be 2 or lower. Only Respondent10 has 2, but their other scores don't meet the criteria. So no one qualifies. 

But maybe the task is to find those who scored perfectly on both 'Recommendation_global_rating_scale' and 'Situation', and their Identification is below the average. Since the average is 2.875, and Identification is an integer (0-3), the only possible scores below average are 0,1,2. But in the data, the lowest Identification is 2 (Respondent10). So if someone had Identification 2, but also had global rating 3 and Situation 3, they would be included. But in the data, the only person with Identification 2 is Respondent10, but their global rating and Situation are both 2, so they don't qualify. 

Therefore, the answer is that there are no respondents meeting all three criteria. But the output format says to provide a list. If the answer is none, perhaps the output is an empty list. But according to the output rules, if it's a list, provide a comma-separated list. If there are none, maybe the answer is ""None"" or just an empty string. However, the example answer was a number, but that was a different question. 

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the criteria. Let me recheck the task: ""scored perfectly on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 'Situation' and whose 'Identification' is below the average for all sessions.""

So 'Recommendation_global_rating_scale' must be 3, 'Situation' must be 3, and 'Identification' must be below the average (2.875). So Identification must be 2 or lower. 

Looking again, no respondents meet all three. Therefore, the answer is that there are none. But the output format says to list them. So the answer is an empty list. But how to represent that? The example had ""15"" as the answer, which was a list of one. But in this case, perhaps the answer is ""None"" or just no respondents. However, the output rules state for a list to provide a comma-separated list. If there are none, maybe the answer is an empty string. But the user might expect ""None"" or similar. However, according to the output rules, if it's a count, provide the number. If it's a list, provide the list. Since the task says ""list all respondents"", the answer should be a list of their IDs. If none, then the answer is empty. But the example answer was ""15"", which is a single ID. So perhaps in this case, the answer is an empty string. But maybe I missed something. 

Wait, let me check the respondents again. Wait, Respondent9 has 'Recommendation_clear_recommendation' 3, but 'Recommendation_global_rating_scale' is 2. So no. 

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the data. Let me check each respondent's 'Recommendation_global_rating_scale' and 'Situation':

- Respondent8: global 3, situation 3 → meets first two, but ID 3 (above average)
- Respondent4: global 2, situation 3 → no
- Respondent15: global 2, situation 3 → no
- Respondent22: global 3, situation 3 → ID 3
- Respondent5: global 3, situation 3 → ID 3
- Respondent16: global 3, situation 3 → ID 3
- Respondent10: global 2, situation 2 → no
- Respondent9: global 2, situation 3 → no

So the only ones with global 3 and situation 3 are Respondent8, 22, 5, 16. All have ID 3, which is above average. Therefore, no one meets all three criteria. So the answer is that there are no such respondents. But according to the output rules, if the task is to list names or IDs, provide a comma-separated list. If none, perhaps the answer is an empty string. But the user might expect ""None"" or similar. However, the example answer was a number, but that was a different question. 

Alternatively, maybe I miscalculated the average. Let me check again. The sum of Identification scores is 23 (from 8 respondents). 23 divided by 8 is 2.875. So the average is 2.875. Therefore, any Identification score less than that is 2 or below. Only Respondent10 has 2, but their other scores don't meet the criteria. 

Therefore, the answer is that there are no respondents meeting all three criteria. So the output should be an empty list. But according to the output rules, for a list, provide a simple comma-separated list. If there are none, perhaps the answer is an empty string. However, the user might expect ""None"" or ""No respondents found"". But the example answer was ""15"" for a different question. 

But the output rules state: ""If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., '17, 21, 23')"". Since there are no such respondents, the answer is an empty list, which would be represented as an empty string. However, in some contexts, it's better to state ""None"". But according to the strict output rules, perhaps just leave it empty. But the example answer was a single number. 

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the criteria. Let me re-express the task: ""scored perfectly on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 'Situation' and whose 'Identification' is below the average for all sessions.""

Wait, 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is the predicate 'pred:Recommendation_global_rating_scale'. So the perfect score is 3. 'Situation' is 'pred:Situation' with perfect score 3. 'Identification' is 'pred:Identification', and we need those below the average. 

But perhaps the average is calculated only for the sessions where the respondents are part of. Wait, the task says ""below the average for all sessions"". So the average is across all sessions, not just the ones that meet the other criteria. So the average is 2.875 as calculated. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that there are no respondents meeting all three criteria. So the answer is an empty list. But how to represent that? The output rules don't specify, but in the example, the answer was a single number. If there are none, perhaps the answer is ""None"". But according to the output rules, for a list, provide a comma-separated list. If there are none, perhaps leave it blank. However, the user might expect ""None"" to indicate no results. 

But the output rules say: ""Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code."" So if there are no respondents, perhaps the answer is ""None"". But I need to check the output rules again. 

The output rules state: ""If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., '17, 21, 23')"". So if there are none, the list is empty. But how to represent that? The example didn't cover this case. Maybe just leave it blank. But in practice, if the answer is zero, but the question is a list, perhaps the answer is an empty string. However, the user might expect ""None"" to avoid confusion. 

But according to the strict output rules, it's better to provide an empty list. However, since the example answer was a single number, perhaps the answer here is ""None"". But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the analysis. 

Wait, let me check the respondents again. Is there any respondent with Identification below 2.875 (i.e., 2 or lower) who also has both 'Recommendation_global_rating_scale' and 'Situation' at 3? 

Looking at all respondents:

- Respondent10: Identification 2, but Situation 2 and global rating 2. Doesn't meet.
- All others with Identification 3: their global and situation scores either don't meet 3 or they do, but their ID is 3. 

So no one meets all three. Therefore, the answer is that there are no such respondents. So the output should be an empty list. But according to the output format, for a list, provide a comma-separated list. If there are none, perhaps the answer is an empty string. But the user might expect ""None"". However, the example answer was ""15"", which is a number. 

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the average calculation. Let me check once more. The sum of Identification scores is 23 (3+3+3+3+3+3+2+3=23). 23 divided by 8 is 2.875. Correct. So the average is 2.875. Therefore, Identification must be less than 2.875, which is 2 or lower. 

No respondents meet all three criteria. Therefore, the answer is that there are no such respondents. But how to present this? The output rules don't specify, but perhaps the answer is ""None"".

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondents participated in a session where the average 'Background (examination)' for that session name is greater than 2.0?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find which respondents participated in a session where the average 'Background (examination)' score for that session name is greater than 2.0. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The responses have a SessionName and a Background_examination score. Each respondent is part of a session, identified by SessionName. The goal is to group respondents by their SessionName, calculate the average Background_examination score for each group, and then find which respondents are in groups where the average is above 2.0.

Looking at the data, let's list all the respondents with their SessionName and Background_examination scores:

- Respondent16: SessionName ""I - MI"", Background_examination 3
- Respondent23: ""II-Anaphylaxsis"", 2
- Respondent8: ""III (Sepsis)"", 2
- Respondent15: ""III - Sepsis"", 3
- Respondent18: ""IV - VT"", 2
- Respondent5: ""II - Anaphylaxsis"", 3
- Respondent13: ""I-VF"", 1
- Respondent7: ""III-Sepsis"", 3
- Respondent20: ""IV (VT)"", -1
- Respondent10: ""(MI)-VT"", 2
- Respondent9: ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"", 2

Now, group them by SessionName. Let's note that some session names might be the same but written differently. For example, ""III (Sepsis)"", ""III - Sepsis"", and ""III-Sepsis"" might be considered the same session. Similarly, ""II-Anaphylaxsis"", ""II - Anaphylaxsis"", and ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"" could be the same. However, the exact grouping depends on whether the variations in punctuation and spacing are considered different session names. The data might have typos or formatting differences, so I need to check if they are intended to be the same.

Assuming that variations in SessionName formatting (like hyphens, spaces, parentheses) are just different ways of writing the same session name, we can group them accordingly. For example:

1. ""I - MI"" and ""(MI)-VT"" might be different sessions. Wait, ""(MI)-VT"" is a different name. Let's list all unique SessionNames as they are written, since the problem doesn't mention normalizing them. So we have to treat each unique string as a separate session name, even if they seem similar. For example, ""II-Anaphylaxsis"", ""II - Anaphylaxsis"", and ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"" are different session names as per the data. Wait, looking at the data:

- Respondent5: ""II - Anaphylaxsis""
- Respondent23: ""II-Anaphylaxsis""
- Respondent9: ""II (Anaphylaxsis)""

These might be considered the same session but written with different formatting. However, without explicit instructions to normalize, we have to treat them as separate. Wait, but the problem says ""session name"" so perhaps the actual name is the same, but the formatting in the data varies. For example, ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" vs. ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" vs. ""II (Anaphylaxsis)""—maybe they are the same session but different entries. But the data shows different dates for some. For example, Respondent5 is on 2025-05-04, Respondent23 is on 2025-03-14, and Respondent9 is on 2025-05-04. So even if the session name is similar, the dates are different. Therefore, each SessionName as written is a unique session. So each unique SessionName string is a separate session.

Wait, but the problem says ""session name"" which might imply that sessions with the same name (even if written differently) are considered the same. For example, ""III (Sepsis)"", ""III - Sepsis"", and ""III-Sepsis"" could all refer to the same session name ""III Sepsis"". But the data entries have different dates. For example, Respondent8 (2025-05-02) has ""III (Sepsis)"", Respondent15 (2025-05-04) has ""III - Sepsis"", and Respondent7 (2025-03-14) has ""III-Sepsis"". Since the dates are different, these are different sessions even if the name is similar. Therefore, each unique combination of SessionName and Date is a session. Wait, but the problem doesn't mention dates in the session grouping. The task is to group by SessionName, not by date. Wait, the question is about the average 'Background (examination)' for that session name. So regardless of the date, all respondents with the same SessionName (as per their exact string) are grouped together. So even if the same session name is on different dates, they are considered the same session. Wait, but that might not make sense. For example, if a session name is ""III Sepsis"" held on different dates, each date is a separate session. But the problem states ""session name"" without mentioning date, so perhaps the grouping is purely by the SessionName string, regardless of date. But that's a bit ambiguous. However, the example given in the initial data shows that the answer was 15, which is Respondent15, who is in a session on 2025-05-04. The example's task was to list respondents from sessions on a specific date with a certain score. So in that case, the date was part of the filter. But in the current task, the date isn't mentioned. So the grouping is purely by SessionName as a string. Therefore, we need to group all respondents by their exact SessionName string and compute the average Background_examination for each group.

So let's list all SessionNames and their corresponding Background_examination scores:

1. ""I - MI"": Respondent16 (3)
   - Average: 3/1 = 3.0

2. ""II-Anaphylaxsis"": Respondent23 (2)
   - Average: 2/1 = 2.0

3. ""III (Sepsis)"": Respondent8 (2)
   - Average: 2/1 = 2.0

4. ""III - Sepsis"": Respondent15 (3)
   - Average: 3/1 = 3.0

5. ""IV - VT"": Respondent18 (2)
   - Average: 2/1 = 2.0

6. ""II - Anaphylaxsis"": Respondent5 (3)
   - Average: 3/1 = 3.0

7. ""I-VF"": Respondent13 (1)
   - Average: 1/1 = 1.0

8. ""III-Sepsis"": Respondent7 (3)
   - Average: 3/1 = 3.0

9. ""IV (VT)"": Respondent20 (-1)
   - Average: -1/1 = -1.0

10. ""(MI)-VT"": Respondent10 (2)
    - Average: 2/1 = 2.0

11. ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"": Respondent9 (2)
    - Average: 2/1 = 2.0

Now, we need to find which of these session names have an average greater than 2.0. Let's check each:

- ""I - MI"": 3.0 > 2.0 → yes
- ""II-Anaphylaxsis"": 2.0 → no
- ""III (Sepsis)"": 2.0 → no
- ""III - Sepsis"": 3.0 → yes
- ""IV - VT"": 2.0 → no
- ""II - Anaphylaxsis"": 3.0 → yes
- ""I-VF"": 1.0 → no
- ""III-Sepsis"": 3.0 → yes
- ""IV (VT)"": -1.0 → no
- ""(MI)-VT"": 2.0 → no
- ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"": 2.0 → no

So the session names with average >2.0 are:

- ""I - MI"" (3.0)
- ""III - Sepsis"" (3.0)
- ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" (3.0)
- ""III-Sepsis"" (3.0)

Now, list all respondents in these sessions:

- ""I - MI"": Respondent16
- ""III - Sepsis"": Respondent15
- ""II - Anaphylaxsis"": Respondent5
- ""III-Sepsis"": Respondent7

So the respondents are 16, 15, 5, 7. Wait, but let's check each session:

Wait, ""III - Sepsis"" has Respondent15. ""III-Sepsis"" has Respondent7. ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" has Respondent5. ""I - MI"" has Respondent16. 

So the respondents in sessions where the average Background_examination is >2.0 are:

Respondent16, Respondent15, Respondent5, Respondent7.

But wait, let me double-check the calculations:

For ""I - MI"": only Respondent16 with 3 → average 3.0 → yes.

""III - Sepsis"": only Respondent15 with 3 → average 3.0 → yes.

""II - Anaphylaxsis"": only Respondent5 with 3 → average 3.0 → yes.

""III-Sepsis"": only Respondent7 with 3 → average 3.0 → yes.

So these four respondents. But let's check the data again to make sure.

Looking at the data:

- Respondent16: SessionName ""I - MI"", Background_examination 3 → average 3.0.

- Respondent15: ""III - Sepsis"", 3 → average 3.0.

- Respondent5: ""II - Anaphylaxsis"", 3 → average 3.0.

- Respondent7: ""III-Sepsis"", 3 → average 3.0.

Yes. So these four respondents are in sessions where the average is above 2.0.

But wait, the problem says ""the average 'Background (examination)' for that session name"". So each session name's average is calculated across all respondents in that session name. Since each of these sessions (as per their exact name) has only one respondent, the average is their individual score. So if a session name has multiple respondents, we would average their scores. But in the given data, each session name (as written) has only one respondent except perhaps some. Let me check again.

Looking at the list:

- ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" (Respondent23)
- ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" (Respondent5)
- ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"" (Respondent9)

These are three different session names as per the data. Each has one respondent. Similarly, ""III (Sepsis)"", ""III - Sepsis"", ""III-Sepsis"" are three different session names each with one respondent. So all sessions in the data have only one respondent each. Therefore, the average for each session is the same as the individual's score. Therefore, any respondent with Background_examination >2.0 would be in a session where the average is their own score. But the Background_examination is a number. Let's check which respondents have Background_examination >2.0.

Looking at the Background_examination scores:

- Respondent16: 3
- Respondent23: 2
- Respondent8: 2
- Respondent15: 3
- Respondent18: 2
- Respondent5: 3
- Respondent13: 1
- Respondent7: 3
- Respondent20: -1
- Respondent10: 2
- Respondent9: 2

So respondents with Background_examination >2.0 are:

Respondent16 (3), Respondent15 (3), Respondent5 (3), Respondent7 (3). 

Therefore, these four respondents are the ones whose session's average Background_examination is greater than 2.0. Because each of their sessions has only them, and their scores are 3, which is >2.0.

But wait, the problem says ""the average 'Background (examination)' for that session name is greater than 2.0"". So if a session name has multiple respondents, we average all their scores. But in this dataset, each session name (as written) has only one respondent. Therefore, the average is their individual score. So the answer is the list of respondents with Background_examination >2.0. But the problem is phrased as ""participated in a session where the average..."", so even if a session had multiple respondents, you include all in that session if the average is >2.0. In this case, since each session has one person, the answer is those with Background_examination >2.0. 

But let's confirm. For example, if a session had two respondents with scores 3 and 3, the average is 3, so both are included. If one has 3 and another has 1, the average is 2, which is not >2.0. So in this dataset, since all sessions have one respondent, the answer is those with Background_examination >2.0. 

Looking back, the respondents with Background_examination >2.0 are 16,15,5,7. So the answer should be 16,15,5,7. But let's check the data again to make sure.

Yes:

- Respondent16: 3
- Respondent15:3
- Respondent5:3
- Respondent7:3

So the answer is 16,15,5,7. But wait, the example in the initial data had the answer as 15. But that was a different question. The current task is different. 

Wait, but let's check if any session names have multiple respondents. For example, ""III-Sepsis"" (Respondent7) and ""III - Sepsis"" (Respondent15) are different session names. So each has one respondent. So their averages are 3 each. So both are included. Similarly, ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" (Respondent5) and ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"" (Respondent9) are different sessions. So each has one respondent. So the answer is 16,15,5,7. 

But wait, the problem says ""session name"", so even if the same session is conducted on different dates, as long as the session name is the same, they are grouped. Wait, but in the data, the session names are written differently. For example, ""III (Sepsis)"", ""III - Sepsis"", and ""III-Sepsis"" are different strings. So they are considered different session names. Therefore, each has only one respondent. So their averages are 2,3,3 respectively. Wait, no:

Wait, ""III (Sepsis)"" is Respondent8 with Background_examination 2 → average 2.0.

""III - Sepsis"" is Respondent15 with 3 → average 3.0.

""III-Sepsis"" is Respondent7 with 3 → average 3.0.

So sessions ""III - Sepsis"" and ""III-Sepsis"" have averages 3.0 each. So respondents 15 and 7 are in sessions with average >2.0. Similarly, ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" (Respondent5) has average 3.0. ""I - MI"" (Respondent16) has average 3.0. So the four respondents are 16,15,5,7.

But let's check the data again to make sure I didn't miss any:

- Respondent16: ""I - MI"", 3 → included.
- Respondent5: ""II - Anaphylaxsis"", 3 → included.
- Respondent15: ""III - Sepsis"", 3 → included.
- Respondent7: ""III-Sepsis"", 3 → included.

Yes. So the answer should be 16,5,15,7. But the order in the list doesn't matter. The correct answer is these four respondents. However, looking back at the data, let's check if there are any other respondents with Background_examination >2.0. Respondent20 has -1, others have 2 or lower. So only those four. 

Therefore, the final answer is 16,5,15,7.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'Background (history)' is higher than the average 'Background (history)' for all sessions on the same date.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find all respondents whose 'Background (history)' score is higher than the average 'Background (history)' score for all sessions on the same date. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The 'Background_history' question has a rubric with scores from 0 to 3. Each respondent has a pred:Background_history value, which is their score. The dates are given in the pred:Date property.

So, the plan is:

1. For each respondent, note their date and Background_history score.
2. For each date, calculate the average Background_history score of all respondents on that date.
3. Compare each respondent's score to the average of their respective date.
4. Collect the respondents where their score is higher than the average.

Let me start by listing all respondents with their dates and Background_history scores:

- Respondent3: Date 2025-04-04, Background_history 3
- Respondent9: 2025-05-04, 2
- Respondent14: 2025-03-14, 2
- Respondent11: 2025-04-04, 3
- Respondent17: 2025-05-04, 3
- Respondent22: 2025-05-16, 3
- Respondent1: 2025-05-02, 2
- Respondent10: 2025-03-14, 2
- Respondent12: 2025-05-02, 3

Now, group them by date and calculate averages:

- 2025-03-14: Respondents14 and 10. Both have 2. Average is (2 + 2)/2 = 2.
- 2025-04-04: Respondents3 and 11. Scores 3 and 3. Average 3.
- 2025-05-02: Respondents1 and 12. Scores 2 and 3. Average (2+3)/2 = 2.5.
- 2025-05-04: Respondents9 and 17. Scores 2 and 3. Average 2.5.
- 2025-05-16: Respondent22. Score 3. Average 3.

Now, compare each respondent's score to their date's average:

- Respondent3: 3 vs 3 (average). Not higher. Exclude.
- Respondent9: 2 vs 2.5. Lower. Exclude.
- Respondent14: 2 vs 2. Equal. Exclude.
- Respondent11: 3 vs 3. Equal. Exclude.
- Respondent17: 3 vs 2.5. Higher. Include.
- Respondent22: 3 vs 3. Equal. Exclude.
- Respondent1: 2 vs 2.5. Lower. Exclude.
- Respondent10: 2 vs 2. Equal. Exclude.
- Respondent12: 3 vs 2.5. Higher. Include.

So, the respondents with Background_history higher than their date's average are Respondent17 and Respondent12. Their IDs are 17 and 12. Therefore, the answer should be ""17, 12"".
