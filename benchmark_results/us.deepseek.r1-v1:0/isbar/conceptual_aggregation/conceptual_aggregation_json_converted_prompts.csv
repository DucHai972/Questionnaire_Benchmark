</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who scored 3 on 'Background (examination)'.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents participated in a 'IV - VT' session?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question. The task is to find out how many respondents participated in a session named 'IV - VT'. 

First, I need to look at the 'responses' array in the provided data. Each respondent has an 'answers' object that includes the 'SessionName' field. My job is to go through each response and check if the 'SessionName' matches 'IV - VT'. 

Looking at the responses one by one:

1. Respondent 1: SessionName is ""V (Hypoglycemia)"" – not a match.
2. Respondent 5: ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" – nope.
3. Respondent 14: ""IV-Hypoglycemia"" – different.
4. Respondent 22: ""IV (VT)"" – Close, but the format is different. The session name here is written as ""IV (VT)"" with parentheses instead of a dash. The question is asking for 'IV - VT', so maybe this counts? Wait, the hyphen vs. parentheses might be a variation. Let me check others.
5. Respondent 3: ""III-Sepsis"" – no.
6. Respondent 16: ""I - MI"" – not relevant.
7. Respondent 9: ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"" – different.
8. Respondent 11: ""IV (AF)"" – no.
9. Respondent 10: ""(MI)-VT"" – different.
10. Respondent 12: ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" – nope.
11. Respondent 7: ""III-Sepsis"" – no.
12. Respondent 18: ""IV - VT"" – here it is! The SessionName is exactly ""IV - VT"". 

So, only respondent 18 has a SessionName that exactly matches ""IV - VT"". The other one, respondent 22, has ""IV (VT)"", which is similar but uses parentheses. Since the question specifies 'IV - VT' with a hyphen, I should only count the exact match. Therefore, the answer is 1.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who scored 3 on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)'.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents who scored 2 on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' also have 'Comments' that contain the word 'reflected'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find out how many respondents scored 2 on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and also have 'Comments' that include the word 'reflected'. 

First, I need to look through each response in the provided data. For each respondent, I'll check two things: their score on the 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' field and whether their 'Comments' contain the word 'reflected'. 

Starting with the first respondent (respondent 9): Their 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' score is 3, which doesn't meet the required score of 2. Their comment mentions ""unclear communication reflected"". The word 'reflected' is there, but since the score isn't 2, this one doesn't count.

Next, respondent 7: Their score is 2. The comment is ""Time: (1:00-1:17)"". No mention of 'reflected' here. So, no match.

Respondent 4: Score is 2. Comments talk about communication skills and being satisfactory. No 'reflected' here either.

Respondent 15: Score 2. Comment is ""Detailed Response - clear communication"". Still no 'reflected'.

Respondent 3: They scored 3, so even though their comment has ""Clear communication"", the score isn't 2. Skip.

Respondent 22: Score 2. Comments mention ""Clear communication skills"" and ""Good"". No 'reflected'.

Respondent 1: Score 2. Comment is ""Satisfactory"". Doesn't have 'reflected'.

Respondent 2: Score 2. Their comment is empty. So, no.

Respondent 13: Score 2. Comments mention ""Lack of communication"" and other notes, but no 'reflected'.

Respondent 6: Score 2. Comment is empty. Doesn't count.

Respondent 21: Score 3. Comment talks about diagnostic clarity, but score isn't 2.

Wait, going back to respondent 9: They have 'reflected' in the comment but their score is 3. So even though the comment has the word, the score doesn't match. So no one else in the list with score 2 has 'reflected' in their comments. 

Therefore, the count should be zero. But wait, let me double-check. Did I miss any respondents? Let me list all the respondents again:

- 9: 3, comment has 'reflected' → no
- 7: 2, no → no
- 4: 2, no → no
- 15: 2, no → no
- 3: 3, no → no
- 22: 2, no → no
- 1: 2, no → no
- 2: 2, no → no
- 13: 2, no → no
- 6: 2, no → no
- 21: 3, no → no

So none of the respondents with a score of 2 have 'reflected' in their comments. The only one with 'reflected' is respondent 9, but their score is 3. Therefore, the answer should be 0.

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Background (examination)' and 'Assessment' is greater than 5.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the number of respondents whose total score for 'Background (examination)' and 'Assessment' is greater than 5. 

First, I need to understand the data structure provided. The dataset has a 'responses' array where each respondent has an 'answers' object containing various fields. The relevant fields here are 'Background (examination)' and 'Assessment'. Both of these are scored on a rubric from 0 to 3.

The goal is to sum the scores of these two fields for each respondent and check if the sum exceeds 5. Then, count how many respondents meet that condition.

Let me go through each respondent one by one:

1. **Respondent 19**:
   - Background (examination): 3
   - Assessment: 2
   - Total: 3 + 2 = 5 → Not greater than 5.

2. **Respondent 7**:
   - Background (examination): 3
   - Assessment: 2
   - Total: 3 + 2 = 5 → Not greater than 5.

3. **Respondent 3**:
   - Background (examination): 3
   - Assessment: 3
   - Total: 3 + 3 = 6 → Greater than 5. Count this one.

4. **Respondent 18**:
   - Background (examination): 2
   - Assessment: 3
   - Total: 2 + 3 = 5 → Not greater than 5.

5. **Respondent 22**:
   - Background (examination): 3
   - Assessment: 2
   - Total: 3 + 2 = 5 → Not greater than 5.

6. **Respondent 23**:
   - Background (examination): 2
   - Assessment: 3
   - Total: 2 + 3 = 5 → Not greater than 5.

7. **Respondent 8**:
   - Background (examination): 2
   - Assessment: 2
   - Total: 2 + 2 = 4 → Not greater than 5.

From this analysis, only respondent 3 has a total score of 6, which is greater than 5. Therefore, the count is 1.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
How many respondents from the 'II (Anaphylaxsis)' session scored 3 on 'Situation' and 2 on 'Assessment'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find out how many respondents from the 'II (Anaphylaxsis)' session scored 3 on 'Situation' and 2 on 'Assessment'. 

First, I need to look through the responses and filter out those who participated in the session named exactly 'II (Anaphylaxsis)'. Wait, looking at the data, there are a few variations of the session names related to Anaphylaxis. For example, respondent 5 has ""II - Anaphylaxsis"", respondent 9 has ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"", and respondent 23 has ""II-Anaphylaxsis"". The question specifically mentions 'II (Anaphylaxsis)', so I need to check if the session name matches exactly, including the parentheses and spacing. 

So, let's check each response:

- Respondent 5: SessionName is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" (with a dash and space). Not exactly matching ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"".
- Respondent 9: SessionName is ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"" – this matches exactly.
- Respondent 23: SessionName is ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" (with a hyphen). Doesn't match the parentheses.
- Respondent 6: SessionName is ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"" – different condition, so not relevant.

So only respondent 9 is in the exact session 'II (Anaphylaxsis)'.

Next, check their scores. For respondent 9, the 'Situation' score is 3, and the 'Assessment' score is 2. That fits the criteria. 

Are there any other respondents in sessions that might be considered a match? Let me double-check. The other Anaphylaxis-related sessions have slightly different names, so according to the data, only respondent 9's session name is exactly ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"". 

Therefore, the count is 1.

Looking at the schema in the 'questions' section, both of these fields use a rubric with scores from 0 to 3. So each of these can contribute a maximum of 3 points. Adding them together, the maximum possible total would be 6. The question asks for a total greater than 5, which means the sum needs to be 6.

Now, I'll go through each respondent in the 'responses' array and calculate the sum of their scores for these two fields. 

Starting with the first respondent (respondent 5):
- 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' is 2
- 'Situation' is 3
Sum: 2 + 3 = 5. This is not greater than 5, so it doesn't count.

Next, respondent 1:
- 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' is 2
- 'Situation' is 2
Sum: 2 + 2 = 4. Also not greater than 5.

Respondent 12:
- 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' is 3
- 'Situation' is 3
Sum: 3 + 3 = 6. This meets the condition.

Respondent 8:
- 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' is 2
- 'Situation' is 3
Sum: 2 + 3 = 5. Doesn't meet.

Respondent 19:
- 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' is 3
- 'Situation' is 3
Sum: 3 + 3 = 6. This also meets the condition.

So, respondents 12 and 19 have a total score greater than 5. That's two respondents in total.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents from the 'II (Anaphylactic Shock)' session scored 3 on 'Background (examination)' and 2 on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find out how many respondents from the 'II (Anaphylactic Shock)' session scored 3 on 'Background (examination)' and 2 on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)'. 

First, I need to go through each response in the provided data and check if they meet all the criteria. Let's start by identifying which sessions are named 'II (Anaphylactic Shock)'. 

Looking at the responses:

1. Respondent 6 has SessionName ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"". 
2. Respondent 9's SessionName is ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"" – note the slight spelling difference. 
3. Respondent 5's SessionName is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" with a hyphen and different spacing. 
4. Respondent 12's SessionName is ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" – another variation in spelling. 

The question specifically mentions 'II (Anaphylactic Shock)', so only respondent 6's session matches exactly. The others have variations like Anaphylaxsis or Anaphylaxis, which might be typos but according to the data, they are different session names. 

Next, check respondent 6's scores. For 'Background (examination)', they scored 3. For 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)', they scored 2. That meets both criteria. 

Now, are there any other respondents in the 'II (Anaphylactic Shock)' session? From the data, no. The other respondents with similar session names are in different sessions as per their exact SessionName entries. 

Therefore, only respondent 6 qualifies. The count is 1.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents who scored 2 on 'Background (examination)' also have 'Comments' that contain the word 'communication'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking: How many respondents who scored 2 on 'Background (examination)' also have 'Comments' that contain the word 'communication'?

First, I need to parse the data provided. Let's look at the 'responses' array. Each respondent has an 'answers' object that includes their scores and comments. 

The task has two main criteria:
1. The respondent must have a score of 2 in 'Background (examination)'.
2. Their 'Comments' field must include the word 'communication' (case-insensitive, I assume).

So, I need to go through each respondent in the responses and check these two conditions.

Let's start by listing all respondents and their 'Background (examination)' scores and 'Comments'.

Looking at each response:

1. Respondent 15: Background (examination) = 3, Comments: ""Detailed Response - clear communication"" → Score 3 doesn't meet the first condition. So, skip.

2. Respondent 12: Background (examination) = 3 → Doesn't meet. Skip.

3. Respondent 17: Score 3 → Skip.

4. Respondent 19: Score 3 → Skip.

5. Respondent 4: Background (examination) = 2. Now check comments: ""Clinical handover and communication skills, satisfactory\nNo panic, no arrest team\nSatisfactory"". The word 'communication' is present. So this one counts.

6. Respondent 23: Background (examination) = 2. Comments: ""Time: (11:43-11:58)\nTalking to registrav could not summarize the condition of patient very clearly\nDID: Sepsis I Anaphylaxsis given by team"". The word 'communication' isn't here. So no.

7. Respondent 21: Background (examination) = 1 → Doesn't meet. Skip.

8. Respondent 8: Background (examination) = 2. Comments: ""Clear communication during handover\nGood"". 'Communication' is present. So this counts.

9. Respondent 10: Background (examination) = 2. Comments: ""Time: (15:53-16:14)"". No 'communication' here. Skip.

10. Respondent 1: Background (examination) = 2. Comments: ""Satisfactory"". No 'communication'. Skip.

11. Respondent 22: Background (examination) = 3 → Skip.

So, the respondents with Background (examination) score 2 are respondents 4, 8, 10, and 1. Wait, wait. Let me check again:

Wait, respondent 4: yes, score 2. Respondent 8: score 2. Respondent 10: score 2. Respondent 1: score 2. Wait, in the data, respondent 1's Background (examination) is 2. Let me confirm:

Looking at the data:

Respondent 4: ""Background (examination)"": 2.

Respondent 8: ""Background (examination)"": 2.

Respondent 10: ""Background (examination)"": 2.

Respondent 1: ""Background (examination)"": 2. Wait, no. Wait, looking at the data again:

Wait, the responses list:

Looking at the list:

- Respondent 4: ""Background (examination)"": 2.

- Respondent 23: ""Background (examination)"": 2.

- Respondent 8: ""Background (examination)"": 2.

- Respondent 10: ""Background (examination)"": 2.

- Respondent 1: ""Background (examination)"": 2. Wait, no. Let me check each one again.

Wait, the responses are:

1. Respondent 15: 3

2. Respondent 12: 3

3. Respondent 17: 3

4. Respondent 19: 3

5. Respondent 4: 2

6. Respondent 23: 2

7. Respondent 21: 1

8. Respondent 8: 2

9. Respondent 10: 2

10. Respondent 1: 2 (Wait, in the data for respondent 1, ""Background (examination)"": 2. Let me check:

Looking at respondent 1's data:

{
  ""respondent"": ""1"",
  ""answers"": {
    ""Date"": ""2025-05-02"",
    ""SessionName"": ""V (Hypoglycemia)"",
    ""Identification"": -1,
    ""Situation"": 2,
    ""Background (history)"": 2,
    ""Background (examination)"": 2,
    ""Assessment"": 3,
    ""Recommendation (clear recommendation)"": 2,
    ""Recommendation (global rating scale)"": 2,
    ""Comments"": ""Satisfactory""
  }
}

Yes, Background (examination) is 2. So respondents with score 2 are 4, 23, 8, 10, 1. Wait, no. Let me list all:

Looking through each response:

- Respondent 4: 2

- Respondent 23: 2

- Respondent 8: 2

- Respondent 10: 2

- Respondent 1: 2

Wait, that's five respondents. But earlier I thought 4, 8, 10, 1. Wait, no. Let me count again:

Looking at each response in order:

1. 15: 3

2. 12:3

3.17:3

4.19:3

5.4:2

6.23:2

7.21:1

8.8:2

9.10:2

10.1:2

11.22:3

So respondents with Background (examination) = 2 are 4, 23, 8, 10, 1. That's five respondents. Wait, but in the initial analysis, I thought 4, 8, 10, 1. But respondent 23 also has 2. So that's five. But in the first pass, I thought respondent 23's comments don't have 'communication', so they wouldn't count. Let's check each of these five.

Now, for each of these five, check if their 'Comments' include 'communication' (case-insensitive).

Respondent 4: Comments: ""Clinical handover and communication skills, satisfactory\nNo panic, no arrest team\nSatisfactory"" → 'communication' is present. So yes.

Respondent 23: Comments: ""Time: (11:43-11:58)\nTalking to registrav could not summarize the condition of patient very clearly\nDID: Sepsis I Anaphylaxsis given by team"" → No 'communication' here. So no.

Respondent 8: Comments: ""Clear communication during handover\nGood"" → 'communication' present. Yes.

Respondent 10: Comments: ""Time: (15:53-16:14)"" → No.

Respondent 1: Comments: ""Satisfactory"" → No.

So, out of the five respondents with Background (examination) = 2, only respondents 4 and 8 have 'communication' in their comments. Therefore, the answer should be 2.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents who scored 3 on 'Background (examination)' also have 'Comments' that contain the word 'reflected'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking: How many respondents who scored 3 on 'Background (examination)' also have 'Comments' that contain the word 'reflected'?

First, I need to parse the data provided. The data includes a list of responses from different respondents. Each respondent has an ""answers"" section with various fields, including 'Background (examination)' and 'Comments'. 

The task is to count the number of respondents who meet two criteria:
1. They scored 3 on 'Background (examination)'.
2. Their 'Comments' field contains the word 'reflected'.

So, my first step is to go through each respondent in the responses and check these two conditions.

Let me start by looking at each respondent one by one.

Looking at respondent 10:
- 'Background (examination)' score is 2. So, doesn't meet the first condition. Skip.

Respondent 15:
- 'Background (examination)' is 3. Now check the 'Comments' field. The comment is ""Detailed Response - clear communication"". The word 'reflected' isn't here. So, no.

Respondent 21:
- 'Background (examination)' is 1. Doesn't meet the score requirement. Skip.

Respondent 1:
- Score is 2. Skip.

Respondent 2:
- Score is 3. Comments are empty. No 'reflected' here. So, no.

Respondent 16:
- Score is 3. Comments: ""Consent denied for video recordings\nSatisfactory"". No 'reflected' in the comments. Doesn't meet the second condition.

Respondent 13:
- Score is 1. Skip.

Respondent 14:
- Score is 2. Skip.

Respondent 11:
- Score is 3. Comments: ""Clear communication and handover"". No 'reflected' here.

Respondent 19:
- Score is 3. Comments: ""Wrong CPR position\nClarity is a bit low over whole case scenario\nSatisfactory"". Still no 'reflected'.

Respondent 8:
- Score is 2. Skip.

Respondent 12:
- Score is 3. Comments: ""Good"". No 'reflected'.

Wait, did I miss any? Let me check again.

Looking through all the responses where 'Background (examination)' is 3:

- Respondent 15: 3, comments don't have 'reflected'.
- Respondent 2: 3, comments empty.
- Respondent 16: 3, comments no.
- Respondent 11: 3, comments no.
- Respondent 19: 3, comments no.
- Respondent 12: 3, comments no.

None of these have 'reflected' in their comments. So the count is zero. But wait, maybe I missed a respondent? Let me check again.

Wait, the data provided in the responses:

Looking at each entry again:

Respondent 15: ""Detailed Response - clear communication"" – no.

Respondent 2: """" (empty).

Respondent 16: ""Consent denied for video recordings\nSatisfactory"".

Respondent 11: ""Clear communication and handover"".

Respondent 19: ""Wrong CPR position\nClarity is a bit low over whole case scenario\nSatisfactory"".

Respondent 12: ""Good"".

No one has 'reflected' in their comments. Therefore, the answer should be 0.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and 'Background (history)' is greater than 5.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the number of respondents whose total score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and 'Background (history)' is greater than 5. 

First, I need to understand the data structure provided. The responses array contains each respondent's answers. Each answer includes various fields, and we're specifically interested in two: 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and 'Background (history)'. 

I need to go through each respondent in the responses list and check the values of these two fields. For each respondent, I'll sum the scores of these two fields. If the sum is greater than 5, I'll count that respondent.

Let me start by listing out all the respondents and their scores for these two categories.

Looking at the responses:

1. Respondent 3:
   - Background (history): 3
   - Recommendation (clear recommendation): 3
   Sum: 3 + 3 = 6 → This is greater than 5. Count = 1.

2. Respondent 23:
   - Background (history): 2
   - Recommendation (clear recommendation): 3
   Sum: 2 + 3 = 5 → Not greater than 5. Not counted.

3. Respondent 11:
   - Background (history): 3
   - Recommendation (clear recommendation): 3
   Sum: 6 → Count = 2.

4. Respondent 20:
   - Background (history): 2
   - Recommendation (clear recommendation): 2
   Sum: 4 → Not counted.

5. Respondent 5:
   - Background (history): 3
   - Recommendation (clear recommendation): 2
   Sum: 5 → Not counted.

6. Respondent 22:
   - Background (history): 3
   - Recommendation (clear recommendation): 2
   Sum: 5 → Not counted.

7. Respondent 19:
   - Background (history): 3
   - Recommendation (clear recommendation): 3
   Sum: 6 → Count = 3.

8. Respondent 9:
   - Background (history): 2
   - Recommendation (clear recommendation): 3
   Sum: 5 → Not counted.

9. Respondent 10:
   - Background (history): 2
   - Recommendation (clear recommendation): 2
   Sum: 4 → Not counted.

10. Respondent 21:
    - Background (history): 3
    - Recommendation (clear recommendation): 3
    Sum: 6 → Count = 4.

11. Respondent 15:
    - Background (history): 2
    - Recommendation (clear recommendation): 2
    Sum: 4 → Not counted.

So, the respondents who meet the criteria are 3, 11, 19, and 21. That's a total of 4 respondents.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents from the '(MI)-VT' session scored 2 on 'Assessment' and 2 on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find out how many respondents from the '(MI)-VT' session scored 2 on 'Assessment' and 2 on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)'. 

First, I need to look through the responses provided and filter out those that belong to the session named '(MI)-VT'. Let me go through each respondent one by one.

Looking at the responses array, each respondent has a ""SessionName"" under their answers. I need to check which of these have ""SessionName"" exactly matching '(MI)-VT'. 

Starting with respondent 23: SessionName is ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" – not a match. Respondent 11: ""IV (AF)"" – nope. Respondent 13: ""I-VF"" – no. Respondent 20: ""IV (VT)"" – not matching. Respondent 17: ""V (Hypoglycemia)"" – no. Respondent 10: SessionName is ""(MI)-VT"" – that's a match. Then the rest: 15 is ""III - Sepsis"", 14 is ""IV-Hypoglycemia"", respondent 2: ""MI"", 21: ""I (Myocardial infarction)"", 12: ""II (Anaphylaxis)"", and 19: ""I - MI"". So only respondent 10 has the SessionName ""(MI)-VT"".

Now, for respondent 10, check their scores for 'Assessment' and 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)'. Their answers show Assessment is 2 and Recommendation (clear recommendation) is also 2. Both conditions are met here. 

Are there any other respondents in the '(MI)-VT' session? From the data, no. Only respondent 10. So the count is 1.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents from the 'I-VF' session scored 2 on 'Assessment' and 3 on 'Situation'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking how many respondents from the 'I-VF' session scored 2 on 'Assessment' and 3 on 'Situation'. 

First, I need to look through the responses and find all entries where the SessionName is 'I-VF'. Let me go through each respondent one by one.

Looking at the responses list:

- Respondent 7: SessionName is ""III-Sepsis"" – not I-VF.
- Respondent 14: ""IV-Hypoglycemia"" – nope.
- Respondent 15: ""III - Sepsis"" – no.
- Respondent 8: ""III (Sepsis)"" – not matching.
- Respondent 22: ""IV (VT)"" – no.
- Respondent 11: ""IV (AF)"" – not it.
- Respondent 21: ""I (Myocardial infarction)"" – different session.
- Respondent 13: SessionName is ""I-VF"" – that's the one we need.
- Respondent 23: ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" – no.
- Respondent 12: ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" – nope.
- Respondent 2: ""MI"" – not I-VF.
- Respondent 6: ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"" – no.

So only respondent 13 is in the 'I-VF' session. Now, check their scores for 'Assessment' and 'Situation'. 

Looking at respondent 13's answers:
- Situation: 3
- Assessment: 2

So they meet both criteria. Therefore, the count is 1.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents who scored 2 on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' also have 'Comments' that contain the word 'unclear'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking: How many respondents who scored 2 on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' also have 'Comments' that contain the word 'unclear'? 

First, I need to parse the data provided. Let's look at the 'responses' array. Each respondent has an 'answers' object that includes various fields, including 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 'Comments'. 

The task is to count the number of respondents where two conditions are met:
1. Their score for 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is exactly 2.
2. Their 'Comments' field contains the word 'unclear' (case-insensitive, I assume).

So, I'll go through each respondent in the responses and check these two conditions.

Starting with the first respondent (respondent 11): Their 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is 3, so that's not a match. Move on.

Respondent 22: Their GRS is 3. Not a match.

Respondent 9: GRS is 2. Now check the Comments: ""Overall a bit unclear communication reflected"". The word 'unclear' is present here. So this is a match.

Respondent 12: GRS is 3. Not a match.

Respondent 5: GRS is 3. No.

Respondent 16: GRS is 3. No.

Respondent 3: GRS is 3. No.

Respondent 17: GRS is 2. Comments: ""Concise - clear\nSatisfactory"". No 'unclear' here. So not a match.

Respondent 14: GRS is 2. Comments: ""Time: (2:36-2:53)\nLate response for considering consultation"". No 'unclear' here. Doesn't match.

Respondent 2: GRS is 1. So no.

Respondent 15: GRS is 2. Comments: ""Detailed Response - clear communication"". No 'unclear' here. So no match.

So, the only respondent that meets both conditions is respondent 9. Therefore, the count is 1.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents from the 'IV - VT' session scored 2 on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 3 on 'Situation'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find out how many respondents from the 'IV - VT' session scored 2 on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 3 on 'Situation'. 

First, I need to look through the responses provided and filter them based on the session name. The session in question is 'IV - VT'. Let me check each response's SessionName.

Looking at the responses:

1. Respondent 4: SessionName is ""III (Sepsis)"" – not relevant.
2. Respondent 12: ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" – nope.
3. Respondent 5: ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" – no.
4. Respondent 18: ""IV - VT"" – this matches the session we're looking for.
5. Respondent 2: ""MI"" – not relevant.
6. Respondent 20: ""IV (VT)"" – the format is different, but the session is IV and VT. However, the exact name here is ""IV (VT)"", which might be considered the same as ""IV - VT"" but the question specifies 'IV - VT', so maybe only exact matches count. Need to check if variations are considered the same. The example given in the data shows that ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" and ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" are different sessions, but in the example, the answer was 2 for 'I - MI' session. Looking at the example, the session names that matched were ""MI"" and possibly others. Wait, in the example, the answer was 2, but looking at the data, only respondent 2 had ""MI"" as SessionName. Wait, maybe the example had a typo. But in this case, the question is about 'IV - VT', so I need to check all variations of IV and VT.

Wait, the responses include:

- Respondent 18: ""IV - VT""
- Respondent 20: ""IV (VT)""
- Respondent 11: ""IV (AF)""
- Respondent 23: ""II-Anaphylaxsis""

So, the exact session name as per the question is 'IV - VT', which is exactly what respondent 18 has. Respondent 20 has ""IV (VT)"", which is a different formatting. The question is whether these are considered the same. The example in the problem might help. In the example, the answer was 2 for 'I - MI' session. Looking at the example data, the session names included ""MI"" (respondent 2) and others. But the example answer was 2, which might mean that the session name ""MI"" is considered part of 'I - MI'? Wait, the example's answer was 2, but in the example data, only respondent 2 had ""MI"" as the SessionName. So perhaps the session name in the example was ""I - MI"", but the data had ""MI"" as the session name. That suggests that the session names might be abbreviated or have different formats, but the question's session name is a specific one. So in the example, the answer was 2, but the data shows only one respondent with ""MI"". Hmm, maybe the example is simplified. 

But in our current task, the question is about 'IV - VT' session. So we need to look for exact matches. The responses with SessionName ""IV - VT"" is only respondent 18. Respondent 20 has ""IV (VT)"", which is a different format. So perhaps they are considered different sessions. For example, in the data, there's ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" and ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" as different session names. So the exact name matters. Therefore, only respondent 18 is in the 'IV - VT' session.

Now, for respondent 18, check their answers. The question requires that they scored 2 on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 3 on 'Situation'.

Looking at respondent 18's answers:

- 'Recommendation (global rating scale)': 2
- 'Situation': 3

So that's a match. 

Are there any other respondents in 'IV - VT'? No, only respondent 18. 

But wait, let me check again. The session names:

- Respondent 18: ""IV - VT""
- Respondent 20: ""IV (VT)""
- Respondent 11: ""IV (AF)""
- Respondent 4: ""III (Sepsis)""
- Respondent 7: ""III-Sepsis""

So, if the question is about 'IV - VT', only respondent 18. If the question had been 'IV (VT)', then respondent 20. But the question specifically says 'IV - VT', so only 18.

Therefore, the count is 1.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 'Assessment' is greater than 5.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the number of respondents whose total score for 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 'Assessment' is greater than 5. 

First, I need to understand the structure of the data provided. The dataset includes a list of responses, each with a respondent ID and their answers to various questions. The relevant fields here are 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 'Assessment'. 

Looking at the questions section, both of these are rubric-based scores. The 'Assessment' has a rubric from 0 to 3, and the 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' also ranges from 0 to 3. So each of these can contribute a maximum of 3 points. Adding them together, the maximum possible total would be 6. The question asks for a total greater than 5, which would mean the sum needs to be 6.

Now, I need to go through each respondent's answers and calculate the sum of these two fields. Let's list them out one by one.

Starting with respondent 2:
- 'Recommendation (global rating scale)': 1
- 'Assessment': 3
Sum: 1 + 3 = 4 → Not greater than 5.

Respondent 10:
- GRS: 2
- Assessment: 2
Sum: 4 → No.

Respondent 20:
- GRS: 3
- Assessment: 3
Sum: 6 → Yes. This one counts.

Respondent 22:
- GRS: 3
- Assessment: 2
Sum: 5 → No.

Respondent 12:
- GRS: 3
- Assessment: 2
Sum: 5 → No.

Respondent 4:
- GRS: 2
- Assessment: 2
Sum: 4 → No.

Respondent 17:
- GRS: 2
- Assessment: 3
Sum: 5 → No.

Respondent 7:
- GRS: 2
- Assessment: 2
Sum: 4 → No.

Respondent 3:
- GRS: 3
- Assessment: 3
Sum: 6 → Yes.

Respondent 11:
- GRS: 3
- Assessment: 3
Sum: 6 → Yes.

Respondent 8:
- GRS: 3
- Assessment: 2
Sum: 5 → No.

So, the respondents with a total greater than 5 (i.e., sum of 6) are 20, 3, and 11. That's three respondents. Wait, let me double-check each:

Respondent 20: 3 + 3 = 6 ✔️
Respondent 3: 3 + 3 = 6 ✔️
Respondent 11: 3 + 3 = 6 ✔️

Yes, three respondents. But wait, let me check again. Did I miss any?

Looking back:

- Respondent 20: 3 +3 =6
- Respondent 3: 3+3=6
- Respondent 11:3+3=6

That's three. Are there any others? Let me check again:

Respondent 17: 2+3=5 → No
Respondent 12:3+2=5 → No
Respondent 22:3+2=5 → No
Others are all below. So total of 3 respondents. Wait, but the example given in the problem had an answer of 2. Wait, no, the example was a different question. The example was about a session named 'I - MI', but the current task is different. So in this case, the answer should be 3. But let me confirm once more.

Wait, looking at the data again:

Respondent 20: GRS 3, Assessment 3 → 6
Respondent 3: GRS 3, Assessment 3 →6
Respondent 11: GRS 3, Assessment 3 →6

Yes, three respondents. So the answer should be 3.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents from the 'II (Anaphylaxis)' session scored 3 on 'Background (examination)' and 3 on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find out how many respondents from the 'II (Anaphylaxis)' session scored 3 on both 'Background (examination)' and 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)'. 

First, I need to go through each response in the provided data and check if they meet all the criteria. Let's break down the requirements:

1. **Session Name**: The session must be exactly 'II (Anaphylaxis)'. I need to look for any variations in the session names, like different spellings or formatting. For example, the example had 'II-Anaphylaxsis' and 'II (Anaphylaxsis)', which might be typos but could be considered the same session. However, the question specifically mentions 'II (Anaphylaxis)', so I should check for exact matches or possible variations that the data might have.

2. **Background (examination) Score**: The respondent must have a score of 3 in this category.

3. **Recommendation (clear recommendation) Score**: The respondent must have a score of 3 here as well.

Now, let's go through each respondent in the responses array:

- **Respondent 4**: Session is 'III (Sepsis)'. Doesn't match. Skip.
- **Respondent 12**: Session is 'II (Anaphylaxis)'. Check scores. Background (examination) is 3, Recommendation (clear recommendation) is 3. This one meets both criteria.
- **Respondent 18**: Session is 'IV - VT'. Doesn't match. Skip.
- **Respondent 22**: Session is 'IV (VT)'. Doesn't match. Skip.
- **Respondent 23**: Session is 'II-Anaphylaxsis'. The name is slightly different (spelling and format), but the question specifies 'II (Anaphylaxis)'. Assuming that 'Anaphylaxsis' is a typo and should be considered the same. However, the Background (examination) here is 2, and Recommendation is 3. So even if the session is considered a match, the Background score is 2, which doesn't meet the criteria.
- **Respondent 9**: Session is 'II (Anaphylaxsis)'. Again, possible typo. Background (examination) is 2, Recommendation is 3. Doesn't meet the Background score requirement.
- **Respondent 8**: Session is 'III (Sepsis)'. Skip.
- **Respondent 14**: Session is 'IV-Hypoglycemia'. Skip.
- **Respondent 16**: Session is 'I - MI'. Skip.

Wait, but the question is about 'II (Anaphylaxis)'. Let me check again. The exact session names in the data are:

- ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" (Respondent 12)
- ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" (Respondent 23)
- ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"" (Respondent 9)

The question uses 'II (Anaphylaxis)', but the data has variations with 'Anaphylaxsis' (with an extra 's'). Are these considered the same? In medical terms, 'Anaphylaxis' is the correct term, so 'Anaphylaxsis' is likely a typo. However, the question specifically asks for 'II (Anaphylaxis)', so unless the data entries are confirmed to be typos, we should treat them as different sessions. Therefore, only Respondent 12's session matches exactly. 

So, Respondent 12 has Background (examination) 3 and Recommendation (clear recommendation) 3. That's one respondent. 

Are there any others? Let me check again. Respondent 23 and 9 have session names with 'Anaphylaxsis', which might be a misspelling. If we consider them as part of the same session despite the typo, then:

- Respondent 23: Background (examination) is 2, so no.
- Respondent 9: Background (examination) is 2, so no.

Therefore, only Respondent 12 meets all the criteria. The answer should be 1.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents who scored 3 on 'Background (examination)' also have 'Comments' that contain the word 'unclear'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking: How many respondents who scored 3 on 'Background (examination)' also have 'Comments' that contain the word 'unclear'?

First, I need to look through the responses and check two things for each respondent: 

1. Did they score a 3 on 'Background (examination)'?
2. Do their 'Comments' include the word 'unclear'?

Starting with the first part, I'll go through each response in the data. Let's list out each respondent's 'Background (examination)' score and their 'Comments':

- Respondent 20: Background (examination) is -1. So, not 3. Skip.
- Respondent 23: Background (examination) is 2. Not 3. Skip.
- Respondent 21: Background (examination) is 1. Not 3. Skip.
- Respondent 18: Background (examination) is 2. Not 3. Skip.
- Respondent 1: Background (examination) is 2. Not 3. Skip.
- Respondent 9: Background (examination) is 2. Not 3. Skip.
- Respondent 19: Background (examination) is 3. Now check Comments: ""Wrong CPR position\nClarity is a bit low over whole case scenario\nSatisfactory"". The word 'unclear' isn't here, but 'Clarity is a bit low' might be similar. Wait, the question specifically says 'unclear', so this might not count. Hmm, but maybe 'unclear' is part of the comment. Let me check again. The comment says ""Clarity is a bit low"". The exact word 'unclear' isn't present. So this one doesn't qualify.
- Respondent 6: Background (examination) is 3. Comments are empty. So no 'unclear' here.
- Respondent 5: Background (examination) is 3. Comments: ""Good clear and precise clinical handover\nGood"". No 'unclear' here.
- Respondent 12: Background (examination) is 3. Comments: ""Good"". No 'unclear'.
- Respondent 13: Background (examination) is 1. Not 3. Skip.
- Respondent 15: Background (examination) is 3. Comments: ""Detailed Response - clear communication"". No 'unclear'.

Wait, so the respondents with Background (examination) score 3 are 19, 6, 5, 12, 15. Let me confirm:

Looking back:

- 19: 3
- 6: 3
- 5: 3
- 12: 3
- 15: 3

Wait, no. Let me check each again:

Looking at each response:

- Respondent 19: ""Background (examination)"": 3
- Respondent 6: ""Background (examination)"": 3
- Respondent 5: ""Background (examination)"": 3
- Respondent 12: ""Background (examination)"": 3
- Respondent 15: ""Background (examination)"": 3

Wait, that's five respondents. But let me check each one again to be sure.

Wait, in the data provided:

Looking at the responses array:

1. Respondent 20: exam -1
2. 23: exam 2
3. 21: exam 1
4. 18: exam 2
5. 1: exam 2
6. 9: exam 2
7. 19: exam 3
8. 6: exam 3
9. 5: exam 3
10. 12: exam 3
11. 13: exam 1
12. 15: exam 3

So respondents 19, 6, 5, 12, 15 have exam score 3. That's five respondents. Now, check their comments for 'unclear'.

- 19: Comments: ""Wrong CPR position\nClarity is a bit low over whole case scenario\nSatisfactory"" → 'unclear' not present. 'Clarity is a bit low' is there, but not the exact word. So no.
- 6: Comments are empty. So no.
- 5: Comments: ""Good clear and precise clinical handover\nGood"" → no 'unclear'.
- 12: Comments: ""Good"" → no.
- 15: Comments: ""Detailed Response - clear communication"" → no.

Wait, none of these have 'unclear' in their comments. But wait, let's check other respondents. Maybe someone else has 'unclear' in comments but didn't score 3 in exam. But the question is about those who scored 3 AND have 'unclear' in comments. So in the five respondents with exam 3, none have 'unclear' in comments. So the answer would be 0?

Wait, but let me check again. Maybe I missed a respondent. Let me go through all responses again.

Looking at all comments:

- Respondent 9: Comments: ""Overall a bit unclear communication reflected"" → 'unclear' is here. But their exam score is 2. So they don't count because the exam score isn't 3.

- Respondent 18: Comments: ""Not very concise or clear communication\nSatisfactory"" → 'unclear' isn't here. 'Not clear' but not 'unclear'.

- Respondent 19: As before.

So the only comment with 'unclear' is respondent 9, but their exam score is 2. Therefore, among those with exam score 3, none have 'unclear' in comments. So the answer is 0.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who participated in a session where the average 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' for that session name is greater than 2.5.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents who participated in a session where the average 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' for that session name is greater than 2.5. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The data has a 'responses' array where each respondent has a 'SessionName' and their answers, including the 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' score. The goal is to group respondents by their SessionName, calculate the average of the 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' for each session, and then count how many respondents are in sessions where this average exceeds 2.5.

Let me start by listing all the SessionNames and their corresponding respondents. Then, for each unique SessionName, I'll calculate the average of the global rating scale scores. Once I have the averages, I'll identify which sessions meet the average > 2.5 condition. Finally, I'll count all respondents in those qualifying sessions.

Looking at the responses:

1. Respondent 12: SessionName ""II (Anaphylaxis)""
2. Respondent 1: ""V (Hypoglycemia)""
3. Respondent 6: ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)""
4. Respondent 5: ""II - Anaphylaxsis""
5. Respondent 19: ""I - MI""
6. Respondent 13: ""I-VF""
7. Respondent 3: ""III-Sepsis""
8. Respondent 20: ""IV (VT)""
9. Respondent 23: ""II-Anaphylaxsis""
10. Respondent 11: ""IV (AF)""

Now, group by SessionName:

- II (Anaphylaxis): Respondent 12
- V (Hypoglycemia): Respondent 1
- II (Anaphylactic Shock): Respondent 6
- II - Anaphylaxsis: Respondent 5
- I - MI: Respondent 19
- I-VF: Respondent 13
- III-Sepsis: Respondent 3
- IV (VT): Respondent 20
- II-Anaphylaxsis: Respondent 23
- IV (AF): Respondent 11

Wait, but some session names might be the same but written differently. For example, ""II (Anaphylaxis)"", ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"", ""II - Anaphylaxsis"", and ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" – are these considered the same session? The names are similar but not exactly the same. The problem states to group by the exact SessionName. So each variation is a separate session unless they are identical. For example, ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" and ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"" are different. Similarly, ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" and ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" might be the same session but written with a hyphen vs. space. However, the data shows them as different strings, so we have to treat them as separate sessions unless the data explicitly states they are the same. So, each unique SessionName string is a separate group.

Now, for each unique SessionName, calculate the average 'Recommendation (global rating scale)':

Let's list each SessionName and collect their GRS scores:

1. ""II (Anaphylaxis)"": Respondent 12's GRS is 3.
   Average: 3.0

2. ""V (Hypoglycemia)"": Respondent 1's GRS is 2.
   Average: 2.0

3. ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"": Respondent 6's GRS is 3.
   Average: 3.0

4. ""II - Anaphylaxsis"": Respondent 5's GRS is 3.
   Average: 3.0

5. ""I - MI"": Respondent 19's GRS is 3.
   Average: 3.0

6. ""I-VF"": Respondent 13's GRS is 2.
   Average: 2.0

7. ""III-Sepsis"": Respondent 3's GRS is 3.
   Average: 3.0

8. ""IV (VT)"": Respondent 20's GRS is 3.
   Average: 3.0

9. ""II-Anaphylaxsis"": Respondent 23's GRS is 3.
   Average: 3.0

10. ""IV (AF)"": Respondent 11's GRS is 3.
    Average: 3.0

Wait, but some sessions might have multiple respondents. Wait, looking back at the data, each respondent is part of a session. But in the given data, each SessionName in the responses is unique except for possible duplicates. Wait, let me check again:

Looking at the responses:

- Respondent 12: ""II (Anaphylaxis)""
- Respondent 6: ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)""
- Respondent 5: ""II - Anaphylaxsis""
- Respondent 23: ""II-Anaphylaxsis""

These are all different SessionNames. So each of these is a separate session with one respondent each. Similarly, ""IV (VT)"" and ""IV (AF)"" are different. 

So for each of these sessions, the average GRS is the same as the individual's score because each session here has only one respondent. Wait, but the problem says ""average 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' for that session name"". So if a session has multiple respondents, we average their scores. But in the given data, each SessionName is unique per respondent. Wait, no, let me check again:

Wait, looking at the data:

- Respondent 5: ""II - Anaphylaxsis""
- Respondent 23: ""II-Anaphylaxsis""

These are two different SessionNames? Because one has a space after the hyphen, and the other doesn't. So they are considered different. Therefore, each session here has only one respondent. Therefore, the average for each session is the same as the individual's score. 

Wait, but maybe there's a typo. For example, ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" (respondent 5) and ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" (respondent 23) – perhaps they are the same session but with a typo in the name. But according to the data, they are different. So unless the data explicitly states that these are the same session, we have to treat them as separate. Therefore, each session in the data has only one respondent. 

Wait, but let me check again. Are there any sessions with multiple respondents? Let's list all SessionNames:

1. II (Anaphylaxis) – 1 respondent (12)
2. V (Hypoglycemia) – 1 (1)
3. II (Anaphylactic Shock) – 1 (6)
4. II - Anaphylaxsis – 1 (5)
5. I - MI – 1 (19)
6. I-VF – 1 (13)
7. III-Sepsis – 1 (3)
8. IV (VT) – 1 (20)
9. II-Anaphylaxsis – 1 (23)
10. IV (AF) – 1 (11)

So all sessions have only one respondent each. Therefore, the average for each session is the same as the individual's GRS score. 

Now, the task is to find sessions where the average GRS is >2.5. Since all sessions have a single respondent, the average is their individual score. So we need to find all respondents where their GRS is >2.5. 

Looking at each respondent's GRS:

- Respondent 12: 3 → 3 >2.5 → yes
- Respondent 1: 2 → no
- Respondent 6: 3 → yes
- Respondent 5: 3 → yes
- Respondent 19: 3 → yes
- Respondent 13: 2 → no
- Respondent 3: 3 → yes
- Respondent 20: 3 → yes
- Respondent 23: 3 → yes
- Respondent 11: 3 → yes

So the sessions that qualify (average >2.5) are all except respondents 1 and 13. 

But wait, the problem says ""count the respondents who participated in a session where the average..."". So even if the session has only one respondent, if their GRS is >2.5, they are counted. 

So the qualifying respondents are 12,6,5,19,3,20,23,11. That's 8 respondents. 

Wait, but let me check each:

- 12: 3 → yes
- 6: 3 → yes
- 5: 3 → yes
- 19:3 → yes
- 3:3 → yes
- 20:3 → yes
- 23:3 → yes
- 11:3 → yes

That's 8 respondents. 

Wait, but let me count again:

1. 12: yes
2. 6: yes
3. 5: yes
4. 19: yes
5. 3: yes
6. 20: yes
7. 23: yes
8. 11: yes

Total 8. 

But wait, the answer in the example was 2. But that was for a different question. In this case, the answer would be 8. But wait, let me check the data again. 

Wait, looking back at the data:

Each respondent's GRS:

- 12: 3
- 1: 2
- 6:3
- 5:3
- 19:3
- 13:2
- 3:3
- 20:3
- 23:3
- 11:3

So all except respondents 1 and 13 have GRS of 3. So 8 respondents. 

But the task is to count the respondents in sessions where the session's average GRS is >2.5. Since each session here has only one respondent, the average is their own score. So all respondents with GRS >2.5 (i.e., 3) are included. 

Therefore, the answer should be 8. 

But wait, let me check if any session has multiple respondents. For example, maybe ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" and ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" are the same session but different names. If that's the case, then perhaps they should be grouped together. 

But according to the data, the SessionNames are:

- ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" (respondent 5)
- ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" (respondent 23)

These are two different SessionNames because of the hyphen and space. So they are considered separate sessions. Therefore, each has one respondent. 

Therefore, the correct count is 8. 

But wait, the example given in the problem had an answer of 2. But that was for a different question. So perhaps I made a mistake here. 

Wait, no. The example was about counting respondents in a specific session (I-MI), which had one respondent. The current task is different. 

So according to the data, the answer should be 8. But let me check again. 

Wait, the task says: ""Count the respondents who participated in a session where the average 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' for that session name is greater than 2.5.""

So for each session name, compute the average of all its respondents' GRS. If that average is >2.5, then count all respondents in that session. 

But in the given data, each session name has only one respondent. Therefore, each session's average is the same as the respondent's GRS. So all respondents with GRS >2.5 (i.e., 3) are counted. 

Looking at the data, 8 respondents have GRS 3 (respondents 12,6,5,19,3,20,23,11). Respondent 1 has 2, 13 has 2. 

So the answer is 8. 

But wait, let me check each session's average again:

- II (Anaphylaxis): 3 → average 3 → include respondent 12
- V (Hypoglycemia): 2 → exclude
- II (Anaphylactic Shock):3 → include 6
- II - Anaphylaxsis:3 → include 5
- I - MI:3 → include 19
- I-VF:2 → exclude
- III-Sepsis:3 → include 3
- IV (VT):3 → include 20
- II-Anaphylaxsis:3 → include 23
- IV (AF):3 → include 11

Total included respondents: 12,6,5,19,3,20,23,11 → 8 respondents. 

So the answer should be 8. But I need to make sure that there are no sessions with multiple respondents. Let me check again. 

Looking at the responses array:

Each response has a unique SessionName. For example, ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" is only once, ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"" once, etc. So no session has multiple respondents. Therefore, each session's average is the same as the individual's score. 

Therefore, the correct count is 8.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who participated in a session where the average 'Situation' for that session name is greater than 2.0.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents who participated in a session where the average 'Situation' score for that session name is greater than 2.0. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The data has a 'responses' array where each respondent has a 'SessionName' and their answers, including the 'Situation' score. The 'Situation' is a rubric-based score from 0 to 3. 

The goal is to group all responses by their 'SessionName', calculate the average 'Situation' score for each session, and then count how many respondents are in sessions where that average is above 2.0.

Let me start by listing all the sessions and their corresponding 'Situation' scores. 

Looking at each respondent:

1. Respondent 3: SessionName ""III-Sepsis"", Situation score 2.
2. Respondent 17: SessionName ""V (Hypoglycemia)"", Situation score 3.
3. Respondent 7: SessionName ""III-Sepsis"", Situation score 3.
4. Respondent 13: SessionName ""I-VF"", Situation score 3.
5. Respondent 14: SessionName ""IV-Hypoglycemia"", Situation score 3.
6. Respondent 15: SessionName ""III - Sepsis"", Situation score 3.
7. Respondent 11: SessionName ""IV (AF)"", Situation score 3.
8. Respondent 6: SessionName ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"", Situation score 2.

Wait, I notice that ""III-Sepsis"" and ""III - Sepsis"" might be the same session but with different formatting. Let me check. The hyphen and spacing might be a typo. For example, respondent 3 and 7 have ""III-Sepsis"", while respondent 15 has ""III - Sepsis"". I should consider these as the same session. Similarly, ""V (Hypoglycemia)"" and ""IV-Hypoglycemia"" might be different sessions. Let's list all unique session names:

- III-Sepsis (including ""III - Sepsis"")
- V (Hypoglycemia)
- I-VF
- IV-Hypoglycemia
- IV (AF)
- II (Anaphylactic Shock)

Wait, but ""III-Sepsis"" and ""III - Sepsis"" are likely the same. Let me group them. So:

1. III-Sepsis (respondents 3,7,15)
2. V (Hypoglycemia) (respondent 17)
3. I-VF (respondent 13)
4. IV-Hypoglycemia (respondent 14)
5. IV (AF) (respondent 11)
6. II (Anaphylactic Shock) (respondent 6)

Now, for each session, calculate the average 'Situation' score.

Starting with III-Sepsis:
- Respondent 3: Situation 2
- Respondent 7: Situation 3
- Respondent 15: Situation 3
Total scores: 2 + 3 + 3 = 8. Average = 8/3 ≈ 2.666...

V (Hypoglycemia): only respondent 17 with score 3. Average is 3.

I-VF: respondent 13, score 3. Average 3.

IV-Hypoglycemia: respondent 14, score 3. Average 3.

IV (AF): respondent 11, score 3. Average 3.

II (Anaphylactic Shock): respondent 6, score 2. Average 2.

Now, which sessions have an average greater than 2.0? All except II (Anaphylactic Shock) which has an average of exactly 2.0. Wait, the task says ""greater than 2.0"", so 2.0 is not included. So sessions with average >2.0 are:

III-Sepsis (2.666), V (Hypoglycemia) (3), I-VF (3), IV-Hypoglycemia (3), IV (AF) (3). 

Now, count the number of respondents in these sessions.

III-Sepsis has 3 respondents (3,7,15)
V (Hypoglycemia): 1 (17)
I-VF: 1 (13)
IV-Hypoglycemia: 1 (14)
IV (AF): 1 (11)
Total: 3 +1 +1 +1 +1 = 7 respondents.

Wait, but let me double-check. The sessions with average >2.0 are all except II (Anaphylactic Shock). So the respondents in those sessions are:

III-Sepsis: 3,7,15 (3 people)
V (Hypoglycemia):17 (1)
I-VF:13 (1)
IV-Hypoglycemia:14 (1)
IV (AF):11 (1)
Total: 3+1+1+1+1=7.

But wait, the example given in the problem had an answer of 2. But in the example, the correct answer was 2, but the data there might have different sessions. However, in the current task, according to the data provided, the answer would be 7. But wait, let me check again.

Wait, the example in the problem had a different dataset. The current task's data is different. Let me make sure I'm using the correct data.

Looking at the current data under <questionnaire>:

The responses are:

1. Respondent 3: III-Sepsis, Situation 2
2. Respondent 17: V (Hypoglycemia), Situation 3
3. Respondent 7: III-Sepsis, Situation 3
4. Respondent 13: I-VF, Situation 3
5. Respondent 14: IV-Hypoglycemia, Situation 3
6. Respondent 15: III - Sepsis, Situation 3
7. Respondent 11: IV (AF), Situation 3
8. Respondent 6: II (Anaphylactic Shock), Situation 2

So, III-Sepsis and III - Sepsis are the same session. So for III-Sepsis, the scores are 2,3,3. Average is (2+3+3)/3 = 8/3 ≈2.666, which is >2.0.

V (Hypoglycemia): 3, average 3.

I-VF: 3, average 3.

IV-Hypoglycemia:3, average 3.

IV (AF):3, average 3.

II (Anaphylactic Shock):2, average 2.0, which is not greater than 2.0.

So all sessions except II (Anaphylactic Shock) have averages >2.0. The respondents in those sessions are 3,7,15,17,13,14,11. That's 7 respondents.

But wait, the example answer was 2, but that's a different dataset. So in this case, the answer should be 7. But maybe I made a mistake in grouping the session names. Let me check again.

Wait, the session names:

- III-Sepsis (respondent 3,7)
- III - Sepsis (respondent 15). The hyphen and space might be a typo, but in data processing, these are considered different unless specified. Wait, but in the data, the session names are:

Looking at the responses:

Respondent 3: ""III-Sepsis""

Respondent 7: ""III-Sepsis""

Respondent 15: ""III - Sepsis"" (with spaces around the hyphen)

So these are two different session names unless we consider them the same. The problem is whether ""III-Sepsis"" and ""III - Sepsis"" are considered the same session. If they are different, then:

For ""III-Sepsis"" (respondents 3 and 7), their scores are 2 and 3. Average (2+3)/2 = 2.5, which is >2.0.

For ""III - Sepsis"" (respondent 15), score 3. Average 3.0, which is >2.0.

So if they are considered separate sessions, then each would have their own average. But that would mean that ""III - Sepsis"" (respondent 15) has an average of 3.0, and ""III-Sepsis"" (respondents 3 and 7) has an average of 2.5. Both are >2.0. So in that case, the respondents in these sessions would be 3,7,15 (3 people) plus the others.

But if the session names are considered different, then the count would be higher. However, in reality, session names with similar names but different formatting might be the same. But according to the data as given, they are different. Unless there's a typo, but the data should be taken as is.

So, if ""III-Sepsis"" and ""III - Sepsis"" are different sessions, then:

Sessions and their averages:

1. III-Sepsis: respondents 3 (Sit=2),7 (3). Average 2.5
2. V (Hypoglycemia): 17 (3). Average 3
3. III - Sepsis: 15 (3). Average 3
4. I-VF:13 (3). Average 3
5. IV-Hypoglycemia:14 (3). Average 3
6. IV (AF):11 (3). Average 3
7. II (Anaphylactic Shock):6 (2). Average 2

So all sessions except II (Anaphylactic Shock) have averages >2.0. The respondents in these sessions are 3,7,15,17,13,14,11. That's 7 respondents.

But the problem is that the session names might have variations. For example, ""III-Sepsis"" vs ""III - Sepsis"" could be a typo, but unless specified, we have to treat them as separate. However, in the data, respondent 15's SessionName is ""III - Sepsis"" with a space, while others are ""III-Sepsis"". So they are different. Therefore, each is a separate session. But that would mean that ""III - Sepsis"" has only one respondent (15) with a score of 3, so average 3.0. ""III-Sepsis"" has two respondents (3 and7) with scores 2 and3, average 2.5. Both are >2.0. So all those sessions are included.

Thus, the total respondents would be 3 (from III-Sepsis:3,7) +1 (III - Sepsis:15) +1 (V Hypo) +1 (I-VF) +1 (IV-Hypo) +1 (IV AF) = 3+1+1+1+1+1=8? Wait, no. Wait, III-Sepsis (3,7) is two respondents. III - Sepsis (15) is one. So total for those two sessions: 2+1=3. Then V (Hypo) 1, I-VF 1, IV-Hypo 1, IV AF 1. Total 3+1+1+1+1=7. Plus the other sessions. Wait, no, the sessions are:

- III-Sepsis: 2 respondents (3,7)
- III - Sepsis: 1 (15)
- V (Hypoglycemia):1 (17)
- I-VF:1 (13)
- IV-Hypoglycemia:1 (14)
- IV (AF):1 (11)
- II (Anaphylactic Shock):1 (6)

So the sessions with average >2.0 are all except II (Anaphylactic Shock). So the respondents in those sessions are 3,7,15,17,13,14,11. That's 7 respondents. So the answer should be 7.

But wait, the example in the problem had a similar structure, and the answer was 2. But in that example, maybe the sessions were different. But in this case, according to the data provided, the answer is 7. However, I need to check again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering ""III - Sepsis"" as a separate session. Let me check the data again.

Looking at the responses:

Respondent 3: ""III-Sepsis""

Respondent 7: ""III-Sepsis""

Respondent 15: ""III - Sepsis""

So the session names are:

""III-Sepsis"", ""V (Hypoglycemia)"", ""III-Sepsis"", ""I-VF"", ""IV-Hypoglycemia"", ""III - Sepsis"", ""IV (AF)"", ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"".

So ""III-Sepsis"" appears twice (respondents 3 and7), and ""III - Sepsis"" once (respondent15). So these are two different session names. Therefore, each has their own average.

For ""III-Sepsis"" (respondents 3 and7):

Situation scores: 2 and3. Average (2+3)/2=2.5>2.0. So this session's respondents (3,7) are included.

For ""III - Sepsis"" (respondent15):

Situation score 3. Average 3>2.0. So this session's respondent (15) is included.

So total respondents in sessions with average >2.0:

From III-Sepsis: 3,7 (2)

From III - Sepsis:15 (1)

From V (Hypoglycemia):17 (1)

From I-VF:13 (1)

From IV-Hypoglycemia:14 (1)

From IV (AF):11 (1)

Total: 2+1+1+1+1+1=7.

But wait, that's 7 respondents. However, the example answer was 2, but that's a different dataset. So in this case, the correct answer should be 7. But let me check again.

Alternatively, maybe the task is to count the number of respondents in sessions where the average 'Situation' for that session is >2.0. So all the sessions except ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"" have averages >2.0. The respondents in those sessions are:

III-Sepsis:3,7

III - Sepsis:15

V (Hypoglycemia):17

I-VF:13

IV-Hypoglycemia:14

IV (AF):11

Total respondents: 3,7,15,17,13,14,11 → 7 respondents.

So the answer should be 7. But I need to make sure that all these sessions have an average >2.0.

Yes:

- III-Sepsis: 2.5
- III - Sepsis:3
- V (Hypoglycemia):3
- I-VF:3
- IV-Hypoglycemia:3
- IV (AF):3

All of these are >2.0. The only session with average ≤2.0 is II (Anaphylactic Shock) with average 2.0, which is not greater than 2.0.

Therefore, the total number of respondents is 7.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who participated in a session where the average 'Background (examination)' for that session name is greater than 2.0.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents who participated in a session where the average 'Background (examination)' score for that session name is greater than 2.0. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The data has a 'responses' array where each respondent has a 'SessionName' and a 'Background (examination)' score. The goal is to group respondents by their SessionName, calculate the average of 'Background (examination)' for each session, and then count how many respondents are in sessions where that average is above 2.0.

Let me start by listing all the responses and their SessionNames along with the 'Background (examination)' scores:

1. Respondent 10: SessionName ""(MI)-VT"", Background (examination) = 2
2. Respondent 11: SessionName ""IV (AF)"", score = 3
3. Respondent 19: SessionName ""I - MI"", score = 3
4. Respondent 20: SessionName ""IV (VT)"", score = -1 (Wait, this is a negative value. The rubric for 'Background (examination)' goes from 0 to 3. Maybe -1 is a missing value or an error. But according to the data provided, it's -1. How should I handle this? The problem doesn't mention handling invalid scores, so I'll include it as is.)
5. Respondent 3: SessionName ""III-Sepsis"", score = 3
6. Respondent 2: SessionName ""MI"", score = 3
7. Respondent 5: SessionName ""II - Anaphylaxsis"", score = 3
8. Respondent 6: SessionName ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"", score = 3
9. Respondent 13: SessionName ""I-VF"", score = 1
10. Respondent 23: SessionName ""II-Anaphylaxsis"", score = 2

Next, group these by SessionName. Let's list each unique SessionName and collect their scores:

- ""(MI)-VT"": [2]
- ""IV (AF)"": [3]
- ""I - MI"": [3]
- ""IV (VT)"": [-1]
- ""III-Sepsis"": [3]
- ""MI"": [3]
- ""II - Anaphylaxsis"": [3]
- ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"": [3]
- ""I-VF"": [1]
- ""II-Anaphylaxsis"": [2]

Now, calculate the average for each session:

- ""(MI)-VT"": 2 → average 2.0
- ""IV (AF)"": 3 → average 3.0
- ""I - MI"": 3 → average 3.0
- ""IV (VT)"": -1 → average -1.0
- ""III-Sepsis"": 3 → average 3.0
- ""MI"": 3 → average 3.0
- ""II - Anaphylaxsis"": 3 → average 3.0
- ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"": 3 → average 3.0
- ""I-VF"": 1 → average 1.0
- ""II-Anaphylaxsis"": 2 → average 2.0

Now, identify which sessions have an average greater than 2.0. Let's check each:

- ""(MI)-VT"": 2.0 → not greater than 2.0
- ""IV (AF)"": 3.0 → yes
- ""I - MI"": 3.0 → yes
- ""IV (VT)"": -1.0 → no
- ""III-Sepsis"": 3.0 → yes
- ""MI"": 3.0 → yes
- ""II - Anaphylaxsis"": 3.0 → yes
- ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"": 3.0 → yes
- ""I-VF"": 1.0 → no
- ""II-Anaphylaxsis"": 2.0 → no

So the sessions that meet the condition are: ""IV (AF)"", ""I - MI"", ""III-Sepsis"", ""MI"", ""II - Anaphylaxsis"", ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"".

Now, count the number of respondents in each of these sessions:

- ""IV (AF)"": 1 respondent (11)
- ""I - MI"": 1 respondent (19)
- ""III-Sepsis"": 1 respondent (3)
- ""MI"": 1 respondent (2)
- ""II - Anaphylaxsis"": 1 respondent (5)
- ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"": 1 respondent (6)

Wait, but looking back at the data, ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" and ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"" are different session names. Let me check:

Respondent 5: ""II - Anaphylaxsis""
Respondent 6: ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)""
Respondent 23: ""II-Anaphylaxsis""

Wait, I think I missed that. Let me recheck the grouping. 

Looking back:

Respondent 5: SessionName ""II - Anaphylaxsis""
Respondent 6: SessionName ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)""
Respondent 23: SessionName ""II-Anaphylaxsis""

So ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" and ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" might be the same session but written differently. Similarly, ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"" is a different name. But according to the data, they are separate session names. So each is treated as a separate session.

Wait, but in the initial grouping, I had:

- ""II - Anaphylaxsis"": [3] (respondent 5)
- ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"": [3] (respondent 6)
- ""II-Anaphylaxsis"": [2] (respondent 23)

So each of these is a separate session. Therefore, the average for ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" is 2.0 (from respondent 23's score of 2), which is not greater than 2.0. So only ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" (respondent 5) and ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"" (respondent 6) are separate sessions. Wait, no: ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" has one respondent (5) with score 3, so average 3.0. ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"" has one respondent (6) with score 3, average 3.0. ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" (respondent 23) has score 2, average 2.0. So the sessions with average >2.0 are ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" and ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"".

Wait, but in the initial list of sessions, ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" and ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" are different because of the hyphen and space. So they are considered separate sessions. Therefore, ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" (respondent 5) has average 3.0, ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"" (respondent 6) has average 3.0, and ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" (respondent 23) has average 2.0. So the first two are included, the third is not.

So the qualifying sessions are:

- IV (AF): 1
- I - MI: 1
- III-Sepsis: 1
- MI: 1
- II - Anaphylaxsis: 1
- II (Anaphylactic Shock): 1

That's 6 sessions. Each of these sessions has 1 respondent except maybe some sessions have more. Wait, no. Looking back, each session name in the responses is unique except for ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" and ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" which are different. Wait, no. Let me check all session names again:

Looking at all responses:

- ""(MI)-VT"" (respondent 10)
- ""IV (AF)"" (11)
- ""I - MI"" (19)
- ""IV (VT)"" (20)
- ""III-Sepsis"" (3)
- ""MI"" (2)
- ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" (5)
- ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"" (6)
- ""I-VF"" (13)
- ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" (23)

So each session name is unique except perhaps ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" and ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" which are different (hyphen vs. space and hyphen). So each session has only one respondent. Therefore, each of the qualifying sessions has one respondent. So total respondents would be 6.

Wait, but let me check again:

The qualifying sessions are:

1. IV (AF) → 1 respondent (11)
2. I - MI → 1 (19)
3. III-Sepsis → 1 (3)
4. MI → 1 (2)
5. II - Anaphylaxsis → 1 (5)
6. II (Anaphylactic Shock) → 1 (6)

That's 6 respondents. But wait, the answer in the example was 2 for a similar question. But in this case, the answer might be different. Let me confirm.

Wait, the task is to count the respondents in sessions where the session's average Background (examination) is >2.0. So each respondent in such sessions is counted. So if a session has an average >2.0, all respondents in that session are counted. But in this data, each session has only one respondent. So if a session's average is >2.0, that one respondent is counted. So the total is the number of sessions with average >2.0 multiplied by the number of respondents in each (which is 1 each here). 

So the qualifying sessions are 6, each with 1 respondent. So total respondents would be 6. But wait, let me check the calculations again.

Wait, let's recheck the averages:

- IV (AF): 3 → average 3.0 → yes
- I - MI: 3 → 3.0 → yes
- III-Sepsis: 3 → 3.0 → yes
- MI: 3 → 3.0 → yes
- II - Anaphylaxsis: 3 → 3.0 → yes
- II (Anaphylactic Shock): 3 → 3.0 → yes
- IV (VT): -1 → no
- I-VF: 1 → no
- II-Anaphylaxsis: 2 → no
- (MI)-VT: 2 → no

So 6 sessions meet the average >2.0. Each has 1 respondent, so total respondents is 6. But wait, looking back at the data, maybe some sessions have more than one respondent. Let me check again.

Looking at the responses:

Each SessionName in the responses is unique. For example, ""IV (AF)"" only has respondent 11. ""I - MI"" only has respondent 19. ""III-Sepsis"" only has respondent 3. ""MI"" only has respondent 2. ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" only has respondent 5. ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"" only has respondent 6. So each of these 6 sessions has one respondent each. Therefore, the total number of respondents is 6.

But wait, the example given in the problem had an answer of 2. But that was for a different question (counting ""I - MI"" sessions). In this case, the answer would be 6. But let me check again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, let me recheck the 'Background (examination)' scores for each session:

- IV (AF): 3 → average 3.0
- I - MI: 3 → 3.0
- III-Sepsis: 3 → 3.0
- MI: 3 → 3.0
- II - Anaphylaxsis: 3 → 3.0
- II (Anaphylactic Shock): 3 → 3.0

Yes, all these sessions have an average of 3.0, which is greater than 2.0. So each of these 6 sessions contributes 1 respondent. Therefore, the total is 6.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who participated in a session where the average 'Assessment' for that session name is greater than 2.5.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents who participated in a session where the average 'Assessment' score for that session name is greater than 2.5. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The data provided has a 'responses' array where each respondent has an 'answers' object. Each answer includes the 'SessionName' and the 'Assessment' score. The goal is to group respondents by their 'SessionName', calculate the average 'Assessment' for each session, and then count how many respondents are in sessions where that average is above 2.5.

Let me start by listing all the sessions and their corresponding 'Assessment' scores. 

Looking at each response:

1. Respondent 22: SessionName ""IV (VT)"", Assessment 2
2. Respondent 3: SessionName ""III-Sepsis"", Assessment 3
3. Respondent 9: SessionName ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"", Assessment 2
4. Respondent 15: SessionName ""III - Sepsis"", Assessment 2
5. Respondent 14: SessionName ""IV-Hypoglycemia"", Assessment 3
6. Respondent 16: SessionName ""I - MI"", Assessment 3
7. Respondent 20: SessionName ""IV (VT)"", Assessment 3
8. Respondent 19: SessionName ""I - MI"", Assessment 2

Now, group them by SessionName:

- ""IV (VT)"": Respondents 22 (Assessment 2) and 20 (Assessment 3). Average = (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5
- ""III-Sepsis"": Respondent 3 (Assessment 3). Average = 3
- ""III - Sepsis"": Respondent 15 (Assessment 2). Average = 2
- ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"": Respondent 9 (Assessment 2). Average = 2
- ""IV-Hypoglycemia"": Respondent 14 (Assessment 3). Average = 3
- ""I - MI"": Respondents 16 (Assessment 3) and 19 (Assessment 2). Average = (3 + 2)/2 = 2.5

Wait, the problem states sessions where the average is greater than 2.5. So sessions with an average of exactly 2.5 don't count. Let's check the averages again:

- ""III-Sepsis"" average is 3, which is greater than 2.5.
- ""IV-Hypoglycemia"" average is 3, also greater than 2.5.
- The other sessions (""IV (VT)"", ""III - Sepsis"", ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"", ""I - MI"") have averages of 2.5, 2, 2, and 2.5 respectively. None of these are above 2.5.

So the sessions that meet the criteria are ""III-Sepsis"" and ""IV-Hypoglycemia"". Now, count the respondents in these sessions.

Looking back:

- ""III-Sepsis"" has respondent 3.
- ""IV-Hypoglycemia"" has respondent 14.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the session names ""III-Sepsis"" and ""III - Sepsis"" (with a space) might be the same session but with different formatting. Let me check. The data shows ""III-Sepsis"" (respondent 3) and ""III - Sepsis"" (respondent 15). Are these considered the same session? The SessionName for respondent 3 is ""III-Sepsis"" and for 15 is ""III - Sepsis"". The hyphen spacing is different. If they are considered the same session, then the average would be (3 + 2)/2 = 2.5, which doesn't meet the criteria. But if they are different sessions, then ""III-Sepsis"" (average 3) and ""III - Sepsis"" (average 2) are separate. The problem likely treats them as separate because the names are written differently. So in that case, ""III-Sepsis"" has an average of 3, and ""III - Sepsis"" has 2. So only ""III-Sepsis"" (respondent 3) and ""IV-Hypoglycemia"" (respondent 14) are the sessions with averages above 2.5. Therefore, the total respondents in these sessions are 3 and 14, which is 2 respondents.

Wait, but wait. Let me recheck:

- Respondent 3: SessionName ""III-Sepsis"", Assessment 3. So average for ""III-Sepsis"" is 3.
- Respondent 15: SessionName ""III - Sepsis"", Assessment 2. Average for ""III - Sepsis"" is 2.

So these are two different sessions. Therefore, the sessions with average >2.5 are ""III-Sepsis"" (average 3) and ""IV-Hypoglycemia"" (average 3). Each has one respondent. So total respondents would be 2 (respondent 3 and 14).

Wait, but the answer in the example was 2 for a similar question. Let me confirm again.

Wait, the task is to count the number of respondents in sessions where the session's average Assessment is >2.5. So for each session, calculate the average, then count all respondents in sessions where that average is >2.5.

So:

Sessions and their average:

1. IV (VT): 2 and 3 → average 2.5 → not >2.5
2. III-Sepsis: 3 → average 3 → yes
3. II (Anaphylaxsis): 2 → average 2 → no
4. III - Sepsis: 2 → average 2 → no
5. IV-Hypoglycemia: 3 → average 3 → yes
6. I - MI: 3 and 2 → average 2.5 → no

So sessions that qualify are ""III-Sepsis"" and ""IV-Hypoglycemia"". Each has 1 respondent. So total respondents is 1 + 1 = 2.

Therefore, the answer should be 2.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents whose comments contain 'Good' also have a total score across all rubric items that is below the average total score for all sessions?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking for the number of respondents whose comments include the word 'Good' and also have a total score below the average total score of all sessions. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The data has a 'responses' array where each respondent has an 'answers' object containing various fields, including 'Comments' and several rubric-based scores. The task involves two main parts: identifying respondents with 'Good' in their comments and calculating their total scores, then comparing those totals to the overall average.

Step 1: Calculate the total score for each respondent. The rubric items are Identification, Situation, Background (history), Background (examination), Assessment, Recommendation (clear recommendation), and Recommendation (global rating scale). Each of these is scored from 0 to 3. So for each respondent, I need to sum these seven values.

Step 2: Find the average total score across all sessions. To do this, I'll sum all the individual total scores and divide by the number of respondents.

Step 3: Identify which respondents have 'Good' in their Comments. I'll check each respondent's 'Comments' field for the presence of the word 'Good', case-sensitive as per the output rules.

Step 4: For those respondents with 'Good' in their comments, check if their total score is below the average calculated in step 2. Count how many meet both criteria.

Let's start with step 1. Let's list out all respondents and calculate their total scores.

Looking at the responses:

1. Respondent 7:
   - Identification:3, Situation:3, Background (history):2, Background (examination):3, Assessment:2, Recommendation (clear recommendation):2, GRS:2
   Total = 3+3+2+3+2+2+2 = 17

2. Respondent 17:
   - All rubric items are 3 except GRS which is 2. So 3*6 +2 = 20

Wait, wait. Let me check each one properly.

Wait, the rubric items are:

- Identification
- Situation
- Background (history)
- Background (examination)
- Assessment
- Recommendation (clear recommendation)
- Recommendation (global rating scale) [GRS]

So each respondent has 7 rubric scores. Let me recalculate each:

Respondent 7:
3 (Identification) +3 (Situation) +2 (History) +3 (Exam) +2 (Assessment) +2 (Rec) +2 (GRS) = 3+3=6, +2=8, +3=11, +2=13, +2=15, +2=17. Total 17.

Respondent 17:
3+3+3+3+3+3+2. Let's add: 3*6=18 +2=20. Total 20.

Respondent 4:
3+3+3+2+2+2+2. 3+3=6+3=9+2=11+2=13+2=15+2=17. Total 17.

Respondent 12:
3+3+3+3+2+3+3. 3+3=6+3=9+3=12+2=14+3=17+3=20. Total 20.

Respondent 14:
3+3+2+2+3+1+2. 3+3=6+2=8+2=10+3=13+1=14+2=16. Total 16.

Respondent 21:
3+2+3+1+2+3+3. 3+2=5+3=8+1=9+2=11+3=14+3=17. Total 17.

Respondent 10:
2+2+2+2+2+2+2. 2*7=14. Total 14.

Respondent 16:
3+3+3+3+3+2+3. 3+3=6+3=9+3=12+3=15+2=17+3=20. Total 20.

Respondent 9:
3+3+2+2+2+3+2. 3+3=6+2=8+2=10+2=12+3=15+2=17. Total 17.

Respondent 11:
All 3s except GRS is 3. So 3*7=21. Total 21.

Now, compiling all totals:

Respondent 7:17

17:20

4:17

12:20

14:16

21:17

10:14

16:20

9:17

11:21

Now, step 2: calculate the average total score.

Sum all totals:

17 +20 +17 +20 +16 +17 +14 +20 +17 +21.

Let's add them:

17+20=37; 37+17=54; 54+20=74; 74+16=90; 90+17=107; 107+14=121; 121+20=141; 141+17=158; 158+21=179.

Total sum is 179. Number of respondents is 10. Average is 179/10 = 17.9.

So the average total score is 17.9.

Step 3: Find respondents with 'Good' in their comments.

Looking at each respondent's Comments:

Respondent 7: ""Time: (1:00-1:17)"" – no 'Good'.

Respondent 17: ""Concise - clear\nSatisfactory"" – no 'Good'.

Respondent 4: ""Clinical handover and communication skills, satisfactory\nNo panic, no arrest team\nSatisfactory"" – no 'Good'.

Respondent 12: ""Good"" – yes, contains 'Good'.

Respondent 14: ""Time: (2:36-2:53)\nLate response for considering consultation"" – no.

Respondent 21: ""Diagnostic clarity is present\nGood and early assessment of condition is done"" – yes, 'Good' is present.

Respondent 10: ""Time: (15:53-16:14)"" – no.

Respondent 16: ""Consent denied for video recordings\nSatisfactory"" – no.

Respondent 9: ""Overall a bit unclear communication reflected"" – no.

Respondent 11: ""Clear communication and handover"" – no.

So respondents 12 and 21 have 'Good' in their comments.

Now, check their total scores:

Respondent 12: total 20. Average is 17.9. 20 is above 17.9, so this doesn't count.

Respondent 21: total 17. 17 is below 17.9. So this one counts.

Wait, but wait, the average is 17.9. So 17 is below, 17.9 is the average. So only respondent 21 has 'Good' and total below average.

Wait, but let me check again. Are there any other respondents with 'Good'?

Respondent 12's comment is ""Good"" – yes. Their total is 20, which is above 17.9. So they don't count.

Respondent 21's comment includes 'Good', total 17, which is below 17.9. So that's one.

Wait, any others? Let me check again.

Looking back:

Respondent 12: ""Good"" – yes, total 20.

Respondent 21: ""Good and early..."" – yes, total 17.

Any others? Let me check all comments again.

Respondent 11: ""Clear communication and handover"" – no 'Good'.

So only two respondents have 'Good' in comments: 12 and 21. But 12's total is 20 (above average), 21's is 17 (below). So only one respondent meets the criteria.

Wait, but wait, the average is 17.9. So 17 is below, 17.9 is the average. So the answer is 1.

But let me confirm the totals again to be sure.

Total scores:

Respondent 12: 3+3+3+3+2+3+3 = 3+3=6, +3=9, +3=12, +2=14, +3=17, +3=20. Yes, 20.

Respondent 21: 3+2+3+1+2+3+3 = 3+2=5, +3=8, +1=9, +2=11, +3=14, +3=17. Correct.

So the count is 1. Therefore, the answer is 1.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who participated in a session where the average 'Situation' for that session name is greater than 2.0.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents who participated in a session where the average 'Situation' score for that session name is greater than 2.0. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The data has a 'responses' array where each respondent has a 'SessionName' and a 'Situation' score. The 'Situation' is a rubric-based score from 0 to 3. 

The key steps here are:
1. Group all responses by their 'SessionName'.
2. For each session, calculate the average 'Situation' score.
3. Identify which sessions have an average 'Situation' greater than 2.0.
4. Count all respondents that are part of those sessions.

Let me start by listing all the responses and their SessionNames and Situation scores.

Looking at the responses:

- Respondent 2: SessionName ""MI"", Situation 3
- Respondent 8: ""III (Sepsis)"", 3
- Respondent 13: ""I-VF"", 3
- Respondent 20: ""IV (VT)"", 3
- Respondent 23: ""II-Anaphylaxsis"", 3
- Respondent 1: ""V (Hypoglycemia)"", 2
- Respondent 7: ""III-Sepsis"", 3
- Respondent 10: ""(MI)-VT"", 2
- Respondent 4: ""III (Sepsis)"", 3
- Respondent 21: ""I (Myocardial infarction)"", 2

Now, group them by SessionName. Let's note that some session names might be similar but written differently. For example, ""III (Sepsis)"", ""III-Sepsis"", and ""III (Sepsis)"" again. Also, ""MI"" and ""I (Myocardial infarction)"" might be related since MI stands for Myocardial Infarction. Similarly, ""I-VF"" and ""IV (VT)"" could be different sessions. Let's check each:

1. MI: Respondents 2 and 10 (since ""(MI)-VT"" might be a different session, but the SessionName is ""(MI)-VT"", which includes MI but is part of a combined name. Wait, the SessionName for respondent 10 is ""(MI)-VT"". So that's a separate session name. Similarly, respondent 21's session is ""I (Myocardial infarction)"", which is another way of writing MI. So need to check if these are considered the same session or different.

Wait, the SessionName is an open-ended field, so exact string matters unless specified otherwise. The problem doesn't mention grouping similar names, so we have to treat each unique SessionName as a separate session. For example, ""III (Sepsis)"" and ""III-Sepsis"" might be the same topic but different sessions. Similarly, ""MI"" and ""I (Myocardial infarction)"" could be different sessions. So we need to take the exact SessionName as given.

So let's list all unique SessionNames and their corresponding Situation scores:

- ""MI"": [3] (from respondent 2)
- ""III (Sepsis)"": [3] (respondent 8)
- ""I-VF"": [3] (respondent 13)
- ""IV (VT)"": [3] (respondent 20)
- ""II-Anaphylaxsis"": [3] (respondent 23)
- ""V (Hypoglycemia)"": [2] (respondent 1)
- ""III-Sepsis"": [3] (respondent 7)
- ""(MI)-VT"": [2] (respondent 10)
- ""III (Sepsis)"": [3] (respondent 4 again, same as respondent 8's session name)
- ""I (Myocardial infarction)"": [2] (respondent 21)

Wait, but respondent 4's SessionName is ""III (Sepsis)"", same as respondent 8. So for ""III (Sepsis)"", there are two respondents: 8 and 4. Similarly, ""III-Sepsis"" is another session (respondent 7). So let's group them properly:

Grouped by SessionName:

1. ""MI"": [3] (respondent 2)
2. ""III (Sepsis)"": [3 (respondent 8), 3 (respondent 4)] → average (3+3)/2 = 3.0
3. ""I-VF"": [3] (respondent 13) → average 3.0
4. ""IV (VT)"": [3] (respondent 20) → average 3.0
5. ""II-Anaphylaxsis"": [3] (respondent 23) → average 3.0
6. ""V (Hypoglycemia)"": [2] (respondent 1) → average 2.0
7. ""III-Sepsis"": [3] (respondent 7) → average 3.0
8. ""(MI)-VT"": [2] (respondent 10) → average 2.0
9. ""I (Myocardial infarction)"": [2] (respondent 21) → average 2.0

Now, calculate the average for each session:

Sessions with average >2.0:

- ""MI"": 3.0 → yes
- ""III (Sepsis)"": 3.0 → yes
- ""I-VF"": 3.0 → yes
- ""IV (VT)"": 3.0 → yes
- ""II-Anaphylaxsis"": 3.0 → yes
- ""III-Sepsis"": 3.0 → yes

Sessions with average <=2.0:

- ""V (Hypoglycemia)"": 2.0 → no
- ""(MI)-VT"": 2.0 → no
- ""I (Myocardial infarction)"": 2.0 → no

Now, count all respondents in the sessions where the average is >2.0.

Let's list the respondents in each qualifying session:

1. ""MI"": respondent 2 → 1 person
2. ""III (Sepsis)"": respondents 8 and 4 → 2 people
3. ""I-VF"": respondent 13 → 1
4. ""IV (VT)"": respondent 20 → 1
5. ""II-Anaphylaxsis"": respondent 23 →1
6. ""III-Sepsis"": respondent 7 →1

Total respondents: 1+2+1+1+1+1 = 7

Wait, but let me check each session again:

- ""MI"": 1 respondent (2)
- ""III (Sepsis)"": 2 (8 and 4)
- ""I-VF"": 1 (13)
- ""IV (VT)"":1 (20)
- ""II-Anaphylaxsis"":1 (23)
- ""III-Sepsis"":1 (7)

Total: 1+2+1+1+1+1=7

But wait, the answer in the example was 2 for a similar question. Wait, but the example was different. The example's answer was 2 because the question was about 'I - MI' sessions. But here, the task is different. So according to the current calculation, the answer is 7. But let me double-check.

Wait, the problem says ""average 'Situation' for that session name is greater than 2.0"". So sessions with average >2.0. All the sessions listed above have average 3.0 except ""III (Sepsis)"" which has two respondents, both 3, so average 3.0. So all those sessions qualify. Then the respondents in those sessions are 2,8,4,13,20,23,7. That's 7 respondents. 

But wait, let me check each session again:

- ""III (Sepsis)"" has two respondents (8 and 4), each with Situation 3. So average is 3.0. So included.

- ""III-Sepsis"" is a separate session (respondent 7) with Situation 3. So average 3.0. Included.

So total respondents: 2 (from MI) + 2 (III (Sepsis)) +1 (I-VF) +1 (IV (VT)) +1 (II-Anaphylaxsis) +1 (III-Sepsis) = 8? Wait, no:

Wait, ""MI"" has 1 respondent (2). ""III (Sepsis)"" has 2 (8 and 4). ""I-VF"" 1 (13). ""IV (VT)"" 1 (20). ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" 1 (23). ""III-Sepsis"" 1 (7). So total 1+2+1+1+1+1=7. So 7 respondents.

But wait, let me check each respondent's SessionName again:

Respondent 2: MI → included (average 3.0)
Respondent 8: III (Sepsis) → included (average 3.0)
Respondent 4: III (Sepsis) → included
Respondent 13: I-VF → included
Respondent 20: IV (VT) → included
Respondent 23: II-Anaphylaxsis → included
Respondent 7: III-Sepsis → included

That's 7 respondents. So the answer should be 7. But wait, let me check if any of the sessions have an average exactly 2.0. The problem says ""greater than 2.0"", so 3.0 is okay. The sessions with average 2.0 (like ""V (Hypoglycemia)"") are excluded. So yes, the answer is 7.

But wait, let me check the data again to make sure I didn't miss any sessions or miscalculate averages.

Looking back:

- ""III (Sepsis)"" has two respondents (8 and 4), both with Situation 3. Average is 3.0. Correct.

- ""III-Sepsis"" (respondent 7) has Situation 3. Average 3.0. Correct.

- ""I (Myocardial infarction)"" (respondent 21) has Situation 2. Average 2.0. Excluded.

- ""(MI)-VT"" (respondent 10) has Situation 2. Average 2.0. Excluded.

So the total is indeed 7 respondents. But wait, the example in the problem had a similar structure and the answer was 2. But that was a different question (specific session name). So in this case, the answer is 7. But let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in grouping. Let me list all the SessionNames and their respondents:

1. MI: respondent 2
2. III (Sepsis): respondents 8 and 4
3. I-VF: 13
4. IV (VT):20
5. II-Anaphylaxsis:23
6. V (Hypoglycemia):1
7. III-Sepsis:7
8. (MI)-VT:10
9. I (Myocardial infarction):21

So the qualifying sessions (average >2.0) are:

MI, III (Sepsis), I-VF, IV (VT), II-Anaphylaxsis, III-Sepsis. Each of these has an average of 3.0. So the respondents in these sessions are 2,8,4,13,20,23,7. That's 7 respondents. So the answer should be 7. But let me check if any of the sessions have an average that's not over 2.0. For example, ""III (Sepsis)"" has two respondents with 3 each, so average 3.0. Correct. ""III-Sepsis"" has one respondent with 3.0. Correct. All others in the qualifying list have average 3.0. So the count is 7. Therefore, the answer is 7.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents have a 'Identification' score that is higher than the average 'Identification' for all sessions on the same date?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking how many respondents have an 'Identification' score higher than the average 'Identification' score for all sessions on the same date. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The data has a 'responses' array where each respondent has a 'answers' object containing various fields, including 'Date' and 'Identification'. The 'Identification' score is a numerical value (0-3 based on the rubric). 

The task requires comparing each respondent's 'Identification' score to the average score of all respondents who share the same date. So, for each respondent, I need to:

1. Find all other respondents with the same date.
2. Calculate the average 'Identification' score for that date.
3. Check if the respondent's score is higher than that average.
4. Count how many such respondents exist.

Let's start by listing all the dates and the corresponding 'Identification' scores. 

Looking at the responses:

- Respondent 9: Date 2025-05-04, Identification 3
- Respondent 10: 2025-03-14, 2
- Respondent 11: 2025-04-04, 3
- Respondent 4: 2025-05-16, 3
- Respondent 1: 2025-05-02, -1
- Respondent 16: 2025-05-02, 3
- Respondent 14: 2025-03-14, 3
- Respondent 6: 2025-04-04, 3
- Respondent 3: 2025-04-04, 0

Now, group the respondents by date:

2025-03-14: Respondents 10 (2) and 14 (3)
2025-04-04: Respondents 11 (3), 6 (3), 3 (0)
2025-05-02: Respondents 1 (-1), 16 (3)
2025-05-04: Respondent 9 (3)
2025-05-16: Respondent 4 (3)

Next, calculate the average for each date:

For 2025-03-14: (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5
For 2025-04-04: (3 + 3 + 0)/3 = 2
For 2025-05-02: (-1 + 3)/2 = 1
For 2025-05-04: Only one respondent, average is 3
For 2025-05-16: Only one respondent, average is 3

Now, compare each respondent's score to their date's average:

- Respondent 9 (2025-05-04, 3 vs 3): 3 is not higher than 3 → no
- Respondent 10 (2025-03-14, 2 vs 2.5): 2 < 2.5 → no
- Respondent 11 (2025-04-04, 3 vs 2): 3 > 2 → yes
- Respondent 4 (2025-05-16, 3 vs 3): no
- Respondent 1 (2025-05-02, -1 vs 1): -1 < 1 → no
- Respondent 16 (2025-05-02, 3 vs 1): 3 > 1 → yes
- Respondent 14 (2025-03-14, 3 vs 2.5): 3 > 2.5 → yes
- Respondent 6 (2025-04-04, 3 vs 2): 3 > 2 → yes
- Respondent 3 (2024-04-04, 0 vs 2): 0 < 2 → no

Now count the 'yes' cases: Respondents 11, 16, 14, 6. That's 4 respondents. Wait, but let me check again.

Wait, for 2025-04-04, average is 2. Respondents 11, 6, and 3. 11 has 3 (higher), 6 has 3 (higher), 3 has 0 (lower). So two yes here. Then 14 (3) on 2023-03-14 (average 2.5) is yes. Respondent 16 (3) on 2025-05-02 (average 1) is yes. So total yes: 11,6,14,16 → 4 respondents. 

Wait, but let me recount:

Respondent 11: yes
Respondent 6: yes
Respondent 14: yes
Respondent 16: yes
That's four. Are there any others?

Wait, the dates:

2025-03-14: 10 (2) and 14 (3). Average 2.5. So 14's score 3 is higher than 2.5 → yes.

2025-04-04: 11 (3), 6 (3), 3 (0). Average (3+3+0)/3=2. So 11 and 6 have 3, which is higher than 2 → two yes.

2025-05-02: 1 (-1), 16 (3). Average ( -1 +3)/2=1. So 16's 3 is higher than 1 → yes.

Others: 9 (3) same as average (3), 4 (3 same as average 3), 3 (0 < 2). 

So total yes: 14, 11, 6, 16 → 4 respondents. 

Wait, but in the list above, I have 14, 11, 6, 16. That's four. So the answer should be 4. But let me check again.

Wait, the respondents:

- 14: yes
- 11: yes
- 6: yes
- 16: yes

That's four. Are there any others?

No. So the answer is 4.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents have a 'Background (examination)' score that is higher than the average 'Background (examination)' for all sessions on the same date?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking how many respondents have a 'Background (examination)' score higher than the average for all sessions on the same date. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The responses are in a list where each respondent has a 'Date' and a 'Background (examination)' score. My goal is to group the responses by date, calculate the average 'Background (examination)' score for each date, then compare each respondent's score to their date's average and count how many are above that average.

Let me start by listing all the responses and their dates and examination scores. 

Looking at the responses:

1. Respondent 18: Date 2025-05-04, Score 2
2. Respondent 8: 2025-05-02, Score 2
3. Respondent 17: 2025-05-04, Score 3
4. Respondent 23: 2025-03-14, Score 2
5. Respondent 12: 2025-05-02, Score 3
6. Respondent 3: 2025-04-04, Score 3
7. Respondent 13: 2025-03-14, Score 1
8. Respondent 2: 2025-04-04, Score 3
9. Respondent 7: 2025-03-14, Score 3
10. Respondent 1: 2025-05-02, Score 2
11. Respondent 22: 2025-05-16, Score 3

Now, group them by date:

- 2025-03-14: Respondents 23, 13, 7. Scores: 2, 1, 3. Average = (2+1+3)/3 = 6/3 = 2
- 2025-04-04: Respondents 3, 2. Scores: 3, 3. Average = (3+3)/2 = 3
- 2025-05-02: Respondents 8, 12, 1. Scores: 2, 3, 2. Average = (2+3+2)/3 = 7/3 ≈ 2.33
- 2025-05-04: Respondents 18, 17. Scores: 2, 3. Average = (2+3)/2 = 2.5
- 2025-05-16: Respondent 22. Score 3. Average = 3 (since only one entry)

Now, compare each respondent's score to their date's average:

2025-03-14 (average 2):
- 23: 2 → equal, not higher
- 13: 1 → lower
- 7: 3 → higher → count 1

2025-04-04 (average 3):
- 3: 3 → equal
- 2: 3 → equal → no counts

2025-05-02 (average ~2.33):
- 8: 2 → lower
- 12: 3 → higher (3 > 2.33) → count 1
- 1: 2 → lower

2025-05-04 (average 2.5):
- 18: 2 → lower
- 17: 3 → higher (3 > 2.5) → count 1

2025-05-16 (average 3):
- 22: 3 → equal → no count

Total counts: 1 (from 2025-03-14) + 1 (2025-05-02) + 1 (2025-05-04) = 3 respondents.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations. For 2025-05-02, the average is 7/3 which is approximately 2.333. Respondent 12 has a score of 3, which is higher. Correct. Respondent 17 in 2025-05-04 has 3, which is higher than 2.5. Respondent 7 in 2025-03-14 has 3, which is higher than the average of 2. So that's three respondents. 

But wait, looking back at the data:

Wait, respondent 7's date is 2025-03-14, and their score is 3. The average for that date is 2. So 3 is higher. So that's one. Respondent 12 (2025-05-02) with 3, which is higher than 2.33. Respondent 17 (2025-05-04) with 3, higher than 2.5. So total 3. 

But let me check if there are any others. For example, respondent 22 is on 2025-05-16, score 3, average is 3, so no. 

So the answer should be 3.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents whose comments contain 'Clear' also have a total score across all rubric items that is below the average total score for all sessions?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking: How many respondents whose comments contain 'Clear' also have a total score across all rubric items that is below the average total score for all sessions?

First, I need to break down the requirements. 

1. Identify all respondents whose comments include the word 'Clear' (case-sensitive? The example in the data shows ""Clear communication"" so probably case-sensitive, but the task says 'Clear' so maybe exact match. Let's check the data.)

Looking at the responses:

- Respondent 11: Comments: ""Clear communication and handover"" → contains 'Clear'.
- Respondent 19: Comments: ""Clarity is a bit low..."" → 'Clarity' but not 'Clear'.
- Respondent 22: ""Clear communication skills\nGood"" → 'Clear'.
- Respondent 21: ""Diagnostic clarity is present..."" → 'clarity' not 'Clear'.
- Respondent 4: ""Clinical handover and communication skills, satisfactory..."" → no 'Clear'.
Others don't have 'Clear' in comments.

So respondents 11, 22 have 'Clear' in comments. Wait, let me check again:

Wait, respondent 19's comment is ""Wrong CPR position\nClarity is a bit low over whole case scenario\nSatisfactory"" → 'Clarity' starts with capital C, but the word is 'Clarity', not 'Clear'. So not included. Respondent 22's comment has 'Clear communication skills' → yes. Respondent 11's comment has 'Clear communication'. So that's two respondents: 11 and 22. Wait, any others? Let me check all:

- Respondent 14: Comments mention 'Late response' → no.
- Respondent 13: 'Lack of communication' → no.
- Respondent 10: No 'Clear'.
- Respondent 4: No 'Clear'.

So respondents 11 and 22 have 'Clear' in comments. Wait, but the example in the data had answer 2 for a similar question. Wait, but in the example, the answer was 2 for 'I - MI' session. But here, the task is different. Let's focus.

So step 1: Find all respondents with 'Clear' in Comments. That's 11 and 22.

Next, calculate their total scores across all rubric items. Then compute the average total score for all sessions, and check if their total is below that average.

First, let's list all rubric items. The questions are:

- Identification (0-3)
- Situation (0-3)
- Background (history) (0-3)
- Background (examination) (0-3)
- Assessment (0-3)
- Recommendation (clear recommendation) (0-3)
- Recommendation (global rating scale) (0-3)

These are the seven rubric items, each scored 0-3. So each respondent's total score is the sum of these seven items.

First, calculate the total score for each respondent.

Let's go through each response:

Respondent 11:
- Identification:3
- Situation:3
- Background (history):3
- Background (examination):3
- Assessment:3
- Recommendation (clear recommendation):3
- Recommendation (global rating scale):3
Total: 3+3+3+3+3+3+3 = 21

Respondent 19:
- Identification:3
- Situation:3
- Background (history):3
- Background (examination):3
- Assessment:2
- Recommendation (clear recommendation):3
- GRS:3
Total: 3+3+3+3+2+3+3= 20

Respondent 14:
- Identification:3
- Situation:3
- Background (history):2
- Background (examination):2
- Assessment:3
- Recommendation (clear):1
- GRS:2
Total:3+3+2+2+3+1+2=16

Respondent 22:
- Identification:3
- Situation:3
- Background (history):3
- Background (examination):3
- Assessment:2
- Recommendation (clear):2
- GRS:3
Total:3+3+3+3+2+2+3=19

Respondent 13:
- Identification:3
- Situation:3
- Background (history):2
- Background (examination):1
- Assessment:2
- Recommendation (clear):2
- GRS:2
Total:3+3+2+1+2+2+2=15

Respondent 21:
- Identification:3
- Situation:2
- Background (history):3
- Background (examination):1
- Assessment:2
- Recommendation (clear):3
- GRS:3
Total:3+2+3+1+2+3+3=17

Respondent 10:
- Identification:2
- Situation:2
- Background (history):2
- Background (examination):2
- Assessment:2
- Recommendation (clear):2
- GRS:2
Total:2+2+2+2+2+2+2=14

Respondent 4:
- Identification:3
- Situation:3
- Background (history):3
- Background (examination):2
- Assessment:2
- Recommendation (clear):2
- GRS:2
Total:3+3+3+2+2+2+2=17

Now, list all totals:

Respondent 11:21

19:20

14:16

22:19

13:15

21:17

10:14

4:17

Now, compute the average total score for all sessions.

Sum all totals: 21+20+16+19+15+17+14+17 = Let's calculate:

21+20=41

41+16=57

57+19=76

76+15=91

91+17=108

108+14=122

122+17=139

Total sum is 139. There are 8 respondents.

Average = 139 /8 = 17.375

So the average total score is 17.375.

Now, the respondents with 'Clear' in comments are 11 and 22. Their total scores are 21 and 19, respectively.

Compare each to the average of 17.375.

21 is above 17.375, so it's not below.

19 is also above 17.375 (19 >17.375). Wait, 19 is 19, which is higher than 17.375. So both 11 and 22 have total scores above the average. Therefore, none of the respondents with 'Clear' in comments have a total score below the average. But wait, maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, the task is to count the number of respondents where:

1. Their comments contain 'Clear'

AND

2. Their total score is below the average total score.

But according to the data, the two respondents (11 and 22) have totals 21 and 19, both above 17.375. So the answer would be 0.

Wait, but let me check again. Are there any other respondents with 'Clear' in comments?

Wait, looking back at the responses:

Respondent 4's comments: ""Clinical handover and communication skills, satisfactory\nNo panic, no arrest team\nSatisfactory"" → no 'Clear'.

Respondent 21's comments: ""Diagnostic clarity is present..."" → 'clarity' not 'Clear'.

Respondent 22: ""Clear communication skills\nGood"" → yes.

Respondent 11: ""Clear communication and handover"" → yes.

So only 11 and 22. Their totals are 21 and 19, both above 17.375. So no one meets the criteria. Therefore, the answer is 0.

But wait, let me check if I missed any other respondents with 'Clear' in comments. Let me check all comments again:

Respondent 11: ""Clear communication and handover"" → yes.

Respondent 19: ""Clarity is a bit low..."" → no.

Respondent 14: No.

Respondent 22: ""Clear communication skills"" → yes.

Respondent 13: No.

Respondent 21: No.

Respondent 10: No.

Respondent 4: No.

So only 11 and 22. Both have totals above average. So the answer is 0.

But wait, maybe I miscalculated the average. Let me recheck the sum:

21 (11) +20 (19) +16 (14) +19 (22) +15 (13) +17 (21) +14 (10) +17 (4) = 

21+20=41

41+16=57

57+19=76

76+15=91

91+17=108

108+14=122

122+17=139. Yes, sum is 139. 139 divided by 8 is 17.375.

So average is 17.375. Both 19 and 21 are above that. So no respondents with 'Clear' in comments have total below average. Therefore, the answer is 0.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
How many respondents whose comments contain 'Satisfactory' also have a total score across all rubric items that is below the average total score for all sessions?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking: How many respondents whose comments contain 'Satisfactory' also have a total score across all rubric items that is below the average total score for all sessions?

First, I need to understand the data structure. The dataset has a 'questions' section that defines each rubric item and a 'responses' array with each respondent's answers. Each response includes scores for various rubric items and a comments field.

The task has two main parts:
1. Calculate the average total score for all sessions.
2. For each respondent whose comments include 'Satisfactory', calculate their total score and check if it's below this average.

Let me start by identifying the rubric items that contribute to the total score. The questions section lists several items with rubrics scored from 0 to 3. The relevant items are:
- Identification
- Situation
- Background (history)
- Background (examination)
- Assessment
- Recommendation (clear recommendation)
- Recommendation (global rating scale)

Each of these has a rubric score. The other fields (Date, SessionName, Comments) are open-ended and don't contribute to the score. 

Next, I need to process each respondent's answers. For each, sum the scores of the rubric items. But wait, some responses have -1 as a value. For example, respondent 1 has Identification: -1. How should I handle that? The rubric for Identification is 0-3, so -1 might indicate missing data. Should I treat it as 0 or exclude it? The problem says ""total score across all rubric items,"" so I think we should include all rubric items, treating -1 as 0. But maybe the original data uses -1 to denote not applicable or missing. However, since the question doesn't specify, I'll proceed by including all rubric items, treating any non-numeric or invalid values as 0. But looking at the data, the responses for rubric items are either numbers (0-3) or -1. Let's check the example given in the problem. In the example, the answer was 2, which might correspond to two respondents. Let's see if that's relevant here.

Wait, the example was about counting respondents in a specific session, but the current task is different. Let's focus.

First, calculate the total score for each respondent. Then compute the average of all these totals. Then, for respondents whose comments include 'Satisfactory', check if their total is below the average. Count how many such respondents there are.

Let's list all respondents and calculate their total scores.

Starting with respondent 1:
- Identification: -1 → treat as 0?
- Situation: 2
- Background (history): 2
- Background (examination): 2
- Assessment: 3
- Recommendation (clear recommendation): 2
- Recommendation (global rating scale): 2
Total: 0 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 2 = 13. But wait, if -1 is considered as 0, then yes. But maybe the -1 is a valid score? The rubric for Identification is 0-3. So -1 is invalid. The example in the data shows respondent 1 has Identification: -1. Maybe it's a data entry error, but since the problem doesn't mention handling it, I'll proceed by treating -1 as 0. Alternatively, perhaps the -1 is a valid code for ""not applicable"" or ""missing"", but since the rubric doesn't include that, perhaps it's a mistake. For the purpose of total score, I'll sum all the rubric items as they are, but if a value is -1, it's treated as 0. Let's confirm with the example. In the example given in the problem, the answer was 2 for the number of respondents in 'I - MI' session. Looking at the data, respondent 16 has SessionName ""I - MI"" and respondent 2 has ""MI"". The example answer is 2, but in the data, only respondent 16 has ""I - MI"", and respondent 2 has ""MI"". Wait, maybe the example is different. Let me check the example again. The example's answer is 2, but in the data provided in the example, there's respondent 16 (SessionName: ""I - MI"") and respondent 2 (SessionName: ""MI""). The example answer is 2, which suggests that both are counted. But that's conflicting. Wait, maybe the example's data is different. Let me check the example's data again. In the example's data, the responses include respondent 16 with ""I - MI"" and respondent 2 with ""MI"". The answer given is 2, which implies that both are considered part of the 'I - MI' session. That suggests that the SessionName is considered a match if it contains ""MI"" in some form. But in the actual problem, the task is different. So perhaps in the current task, when checking comments for 'Satisfactory', it's case-sensitive? The comments in the data have ""Satisfactory"" with a capital S. So we need to check if the Comments field contains the exact string 'Satisfactory'.

Now, back to the current task. Let's proceed step by step.

First, calculate the total score for each respondent. Let's list all respondents and their scores.

Respondent 1:
- Identification: -1 → 0
- Situation: 2
- Background (history): 2
- Background (examination): 2
- Assessment: 3
- Recommendation (clear recommendation): 2
- GRS: 2
Total: 0+2+2+2+3+2+2 = 13

Respondent 11:
All rubric items are 3 except maybe none. Let's check:
- Identification:3
- Situation:3
- History:3
- Exam:3
- Assessment:3
- Clear recommendation:3
- GRS:3
Total: 3*7=21

Respondent 6:
- Identification:3
- Situation:2
- History:3
- Exam:3
- Assessment:2
- Recommendation:2
- GRS:3
Total:3+2+3+3+2+2+3= 18

Respondent 20:
- Identification:3
- Situation:3
- History:2
- Exam:-1 → 0
- Assessment:3
- Recommendation:2
- GRS:3
Total:3+3+2+0+3+2+3= 16

Respondent 15:
- Identification:3
- Situation:3
- History:2
- Exam:3
- Assessment:2
- Recommendation:2
- GRS:2
Total:3+3+2+3+2+2+2=17

Respondent 12:
- Identification:3
- Situation:3
- History:3
- Exam:3
- Assessment:2
- Recommendation:3
- GRS:3
Total:3+3+3+3+2+3+3=20

Respondent 3:
- Identification:0
- Situation:2
- History:3
- Exam:3
- Assessment:3
- Recommendation:3
- GRS:3
Total:0+2+3+3+3+3+3=17

Respondent 14:
- Identification:3
- Situation:3
- History:2
- Exam:2
- Assessment:3
- Recommendation:1
- GRS:2
Total:3+3+2+2+3+1+2=16

Respondent 16:
- Identification:3
- Situation:3
- History:3
- Exam:3
- Assessment:3
- Recommendation:2
- GRS:3
Total:3+3+3+3+3+2+3=20

Respondent 2:
- Identification:3
- Situation:3
- History:2
- Exam:3
- Assessment:3
- Recommendation:2
- GRS:1
Total:3+3+2+3+3+2+1=17

Respondent 4:
- Identification:3
- Situation:3
- History:3
- Exam:2
- Assessment:2
- Recommendation:2
- GRS:2
Total:3+3+3+2+2+2+2=17

Now, let's list all the total scores:

Respondent 1: 13
Respondent 11:21
Respondent 6:18
Respondent 20:16
Respondent 15:17
Respondent 12:20
Respondent 3:17
Respondent 14:16
Respondent 16:20
Respondent 2:17
Respondent 4:17

Now, calculate the average total score. Sum all these totals and divide by the number of respondents (11).

Sum = 13 +21 +18 +16 +17 +20 +17 +16 +20 +17 +17

Let's compute step by step:

13 +21 =34

34 +18=52

52+16=68

68+17=85

85+20=105

105+17=122

122+16=138

138+20=158

158+17=175

175+17=192

Total sum is 192. Number of respondents is 11. Average = 192 /11 ≈17.4545...

So the average total score is approximately 17.45.

Now, identify respondents whose comments contain 'Satisfactory'. Let's check each respondent's Comments field.

Respondent 1: Comments: ""Satisfactory"" → contains 'Satisfactory'
Respondent 11: ""Clear communication and handover"" → no
Respondent 6: """" → no
Respondent 20: ""Good"" → no
Respondent 15: ""Detailed Response - clear communication"" → no
Respondent 12: ""Good"" → no
Respondent 3: ""The patient/simulation is not oriented in TPP.\nClear communication between Reg and colleague during handover"" → no
Respondent 14: ""Time: (2:36-2:53)\nLate response for considering consultation"" → no
Respondent 16: ""Consent denied for video recordings\nSatisfactory"" → contains 'Satisfactory'
Respondent 2: """" → no
Respondent 4: ""Clinical handover and communication skills, satisfactory\nNo panic, no arrest team\nSatisfactory"" → contains 'Satisfactory' (note: 'satisfactory' is lowercase here? Wait, in the data, the Comments for respondent 4 are: ""Clinical handover and communication skills, satisfactory\nNo panic, no arrest team\nSatisfactory"". The first 'satisfactory' is lowercase, the second is uppercase. Wait, let me check the exact data:

Looking at the data for respondent 4:

""Comments"": ""Clinical handover and communication skills, satisfactory\nNo panic, no arrest team\nSatisfactory""

So the first 'satisfactory' is lowercase, the second is 'Satisfactory' with a capital S. The task says ""comments contain 'Satisfactory'"" (with capital S). So only the instances where 'Satisfactory' is present with a capital S. So in respondent 4's comments, the last line is ""Satisfactory"", so it does contain 'Satisfactory'. The first occurrence is lowercase, but the second is uppercase. So respondent 4's comments do contain 'Satisfactory'.

Wait, but the exact string is 'Satisfactory' with a capital S. So in respondent 4's comments, the line is ""Satisfactory"", so yes. So respondents 1, 16, and 4 have 'Satisfactory' in their comments.

Wait, let's check each:

Respondent 1: Comments: ""Satisfactory"" → yes.

Respondent 16: ""Consent denied for video recordings\nSatisfactory"" → yes.

Respondent 4: ""Clinical handover and communication skills, satisfactory\nNo panic, no arrest team\nSatisfactory"" → the last line is ""Satisfactory"" with capital S. So yes.

So three respondents have 'Satisfactory' in their comments: 1, 16, 4.

Now, check their total scores:

Respondent 1: 13 → which is below 17.45.

Respondent 16: 20 → which is above 17.45.

Respondent 4: 17 → which is below 17.45 (since 17.45 is approximately 17.45, so 17 is less than that).

Wait, 17 is less than 17.45, so yes.

So respondents 1 and 4 have total scores below the average. Respondent 16's total is 20, which is above.

Wait, but wait: the average is approximately 17.45. So 17 is below 17.45? 17.45 is 17.45, so 17 is 0.45 less. So yes, 17 is below.

So respondents 1 (13), 4 (17) are below. Respondent 16 (20) is above.

So that's two respondents.

Wait, but respondent 4's total is 17, which is below 17.45. So that's two respondents: 1 and 4.

Wait, but let me confirm the totals again:

Respondent 1: 13 → below.

Respondent 4: 17 → below 17.45.

Respondent 16: 20 → above.

So two respondents meet the criteria.

But wait, the example in the problem had an answer of 2, which might have been a coincidence. Let me check again.

Wait, the task is: How many respondents whose comments contain 'Satisfactory' also have a total score below the average.

The average is 192 /11 ≈17.4545...

So any total score less than 17.4545 counts.

Looking at the three respondents with 'Satisfactory' in comments:

- Respondent 1: 13 → below.

- Respondent 16: 20 → above.

- Respondent 4: 17 → 17 is less than 17.45, so yes.

So that's two respondents: 1 and 4.

Wait, 17 is less than 17.45, correct. So two respondents.

But wait, let me check the total scores again for these three:

Respondent 1: 13

Respondent 16: 20

Respondent 4: 17

Average is ~17.45. So 17 is below 17.45. So two respondents (1 and 4) have total scores below the average and have 'Satisfactory' in comments.

Therefore, the answer should be 2.
