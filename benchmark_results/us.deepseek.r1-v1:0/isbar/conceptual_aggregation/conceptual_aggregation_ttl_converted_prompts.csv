</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
How many respondents participated in a 'IV - VT' session?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question. The task is to find out how many respondents participated in a session named 'IV - VT'. 

First, I need to look through the responses section and check each respondent's SessionName. The key here is to match exactly the session name 'IV - VT' as specified in the task. 

Looking at the data:

- Respondent1: SessionName ""V (Hypoglycemia)"" – not a match.
- Respondent5: ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" – nope.
- Respondent14: ""IV-Hypoglycemia"" – different.
- Respondent22: ""IV (VT)"" – Close, but the format is different. The session name here uses parentheses and no hyphen after IV. The task is looking for 'IV - VT' with a hyphen and space, so this might not count.
- Respondent3: ""III-Sepsis"" – no.
- Respondent16: ""I - MI"" – different.
- Respondent9: ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"" – nope.
- Respondent11: ""IV (AF)"" – different.
- Respondent10: ""(MI)-VT"" – starts with MI, not IV.
- Respondent12: ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" – no.
- Respondent7: ""III-Sepsis"" – same as Respondent3.
- Respondent18: ""IV - VT"" – here we go. This matches exactly 'IV - VT' with the hyphen and space. 

So, only Respondent18 has the exact SessionName ""IV - VT"". Therefore, the count is 1.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents who scored 2 on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' also have 'Comments' that contain the word 'reflected'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking for the number of respondents who scored 2 on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and also have 'Comments' that include the word 'reflected'. 

First, I need to identify which predicate corresponds to the 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' score. Looking at the questions section, there's a predicate called pred:Recommendation_clear_recommendation with the text ""Makes a clear recommendation. [Rubric: 0 = No recommendation, 1 = Clear recommendation only after extended questioning, 2 = Clear recommendation after minimal questioning, 3 = Clear comprehensive recommendation without questioning]"". So, the score we're looking for here is ""2"".

Next, I need to check each respondent's pred:Recommendation_clear_recommendation value. For those who have a ""2"", I then need to look at their pred:Comments to see if the word 'reflected' appears anywhere in the comment.

Let's go through each respondent one by one:

- **Respondent9**: pred:Recommendation_clear_recommendation is ""3"". So, not a 2. Skip.
- **Respondent7**: pred:Recommendation_clear_recommendation is ""2"". Check comments: ""Time: (1:00-1:17)"". No 'reflected' here.
- **Respondent4**: pred:Recommendation_clear_recommendation is ""2"". Comments mention ""Clinical handover and communication skills, satisfactory..."". No 'reflected'.
- **Respondent15**: pred:Recommendation_clear_recommendation is ""2"". Comments: ""Detailed Response - clear communication"". No 'reflected'.
- **Respondent3**: pred:Recommendation_clear_recommendation is ""3"". Skip.
- **Respondent22**: pred:Recommendation_clear_recommendation is ""2"". Comments: ""Clear communication skills Good"". No 'reflected'.
- **Respondent1**: pred:Recommendation_clear_recommendation is ""2"". Comments: ""Satisfactory"". No 'reflected'.
- **Respondent2**: pred:Recommendation_clear_recommendation is ""2"". Comments are empty. Skip.
- **Respondent13**: pred:Recommendation_clear_recommendation is ""2"". Comments mention ""Lack of communication between 2 main interns..."". No 'reflected'.
- **Respondent6**: pred:Recommendation_clear_recommendation is ""2"". Comments are empty. Skip.
- **Respondent21**: pred:Recommendation_clear_recommendation is ""3"". Skip.

Now, looking for the word 'reflected' in the comments of those with a score of 2. The only respondent with 'reflected' in their comments is Respondent9, but they scored 3, so they don't count. All others with score 2 don't have 'reflected' in their comments. Wait, wait, let me check again. 

Wait, Respondent9's comment is ""Overall a bit unclear communication reflected"". Oh, but their recommendation score is 3, so they don't meet the first condition. So none of the respondents with a score of 2 have 'reflected' in their comments. Therefore, the count is 0.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Background (examination)' and 'Assessment' is greater than 5.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the number of respondents whose total score for 'Background (examination)' and 'Assessment' is greater than 5. 

First, I need to make sure I understand the data structure. The 'questions' section defines each field. The 'Background_examination' and 'Assessment' are both scored on a rubric from 0 to 3. So each of these can contribute a maximum of 3 points each. Adding them together, the maximum possible total would be 6. The task is to find respondents where the sum of these two scores exceeds 5, which would mean their total is 6, since 3 + 3 = 6.

Now, looking at the 'responses' section, each respondent has values for pred:Background_examination and pred:Assessment. I need to go through each respondent, add those two values, and check if the sum is greater than 5.

Let's list out each respondent and their scores:

- Respondent19: Background_examination is ""3"", Assessment is ""2"". Sum is 3 + 2 = 5. Not greater than 5.
- Respondent7: Background_examination ""3"", Assessment ""2"". Sum 5. No.
- Respondent3: Background_examination ""3"", Assessment ""3"". Sum 6. Yes.
- Respondent18: Background_examination ""2"", Assessment ""3"". Sum 5. No.
- Respondent22: Background_examination ""3"", Assessment ""2"". Sum 5. No.
- Respondent23: Background_examination ""2"", Assessment ""3"". Sum 5. No.
- Respondent8: Background_examination ""2"", Assessment ""2"". Sum 4. No.

Only Respondent3 has a total of 6, which is greater than 5. So the count should be 1.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

How many respondents from the 'II (Anaphylaxsis)' session scored 3 on 'Situation' and 2 on 'Assessment'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find out how many respondents from the 'II (Anaphylaxsis)' session scored 3 on 'Situation' and 2 on 'Assessment'. 

First, I need to look through all the respondents and check their SessionName. The target session is 'II (Anaphylaxsis)'. Wait, looking at the data, there are a few variations of session names related to Anaphylaxis. For example, Respondent5 has ""II - Anaphylaxsis"", Respondent9 has ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"", Respondent23 has ""II-Anaphylaxsis"", and Respondent6 has ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"". The question specifically mentions 'II (Anaphylaxsis)', so I need to match that exact format. 

So, let's list out the respondents with SessionName exactly ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"". From the data:

- Respondent9: pred:SessionName ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"".
Are there others? Let me check each one:

- Respondent5: ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" (different punctuation)
- Respondent23: ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" (hyphen instead of parentheses)
- Respondent6: ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"" (different condition)
So only Respondent9 has the exact SessionName ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"".

Now, for Respondent9, check the 'Situation' and 'Assessment' scores. 

Looking at Respondent9's data:
- pred:Situation ""3""
- pred:Assessment ""2""

So, both conditions are met: Situation is 3 and Assessment is 2. 

Are there any other respondents in the session ""II (Anaphylaxsis)""? From the list above, only Respondent9. Therefore, the count is 1.

Wait, but maybe I should check if there are other respondents with similar session names that might be considered the same. For example, Respondent5's session is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" which might be a typo or variation. But the question specifies 'II (Anaphylaxsis)', so I should stick to exact matches. 

Therefore, the answer is 1.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and 'Situation' is greater than 5.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents whose total score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and 'Situation' is greater than 5. 

First, I need to make sure I understand the data structure. The questions section defines each field. The 'Recommendation_clear_recommendation' and 'Situation' are both rubric-based questions with scores from 0 to 3. 

Looking at the responses, each respondent has a value for these two fields. The total score is the sum of these two values. We need to find how many respondents have a sum greater than 5.

Let me go through each respondent one by one.

Starting with Respondent5:
- Recommendation_clear_recommendation is 2
- Situation is 3
Total = 2 + 3 = 5. That's not greater than 5, so this one doesn't count.

Next, Respondent1:
- Recommendation_clear_recommendation is 2
- Situation is 2
Total = 2 + 2 = 4. Also not greater than 5.

Respondent12:
- Recommendation_clear_recommendation is 3
- Situation is 3
Total = 3 + 3 = 6. This is greater than 5. So count this one.

Respondent8:
- Recommendation_clear_recommendation is 2
- Situation is 3
Total = 2 + 3 = 5. Not greater than 5.

Respondent19:
- Recommendation_clear_recommendation is 3
- Situation is 3
Total = 3 + 3 = 6. This also exceeds 5. So count this one.

So, respondents 12 and 19 meet the criteria. That's a total of 2 respondents.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents from the 'II (Anaphylactic Shock)' session scored 3 on 'Background (examination)' and 2 on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find out how many respondents from the 'II (Anaphylactic Shock)' session scored 3 on 'Background (examination)' and 2 on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)'. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The data has respondents with various properties, including SessionName, Background_examination, and Recommendation_clear_recommendation. 

Looking at the questions section, the 'Background_examination' corresponds to the question about giving appropriate examination/observations, with a rubric from 0 to 3. Similarly, 'Recommendation_clear_recommendation' is about making a clear recommendation, also scored 0-3. 

Now, I need to filter the respondents based on three criteria:
1. Their SessionName is exactly 'II (Anaphylactic Shock)'.
2. Their Background_examination score is 3.
3. Their Recommendation_clear_recommendation score is 2.

Let's go through each respondent:

- **Respondent1**: SessionName is ""V (Hypoglycemia)"". Doesn't match. Skip.
- **Respondent6**: SessionName is ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"". Check scores: Background_examination is 3, Recommendation_clear_recommendation is 2. This matches both criteria. Count = 1.
- **Respondent9**: SessionName is ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"". Different spelling, so not exact match. Skip.
- **Respondent2**: SessionName is ""MI"". Doesn't match. Skip.
- **Respondent5**: SessionName is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"". The hyphen and spelling differ from the target session name. Not exact. Skip.
- **Respondent14**: SessionName is ""IV-Hypoglycemia"". Doesn't match. Skip.
- **Respondent17**: SessionName is ""V (Hypoglycemia)"". No match.
- **Respondent4**: SessionName is ""III (Sepsis)"". No.
- **Respondent12**: SessionName is ""II (Anaphylaxis)"". Spelling difference (Anaphylaxis vs. Anaphylactic Shock). Not exact.
- **Respondent20**: SessionName is ""IV (VT)"". No.

Only Respondent6 meets all the conditions. So the answer should be 1.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents who scored 2 on 'Background (examination)' also have 'Comments' that contain the word 'communication'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find out how many respondents scored 2 on 'Background (examination)' and also have 'Comments' that include the word 'communication'. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The 'Background_examination' predicate corresponds to the question about giving appropriate examination/observations, with a rubric from 0 to 3. The 'Comments' field is an open-ended response where the respondent can write any text.

Looking at the responses, each respondent has a 'pred:Background_examination' value and a 'pred:Comments' value. I need to filter respondents who have a 'Background_examination' score of exactly 2 and whose comments contain the word 'communication' (case-insensitive, probably).

Let me go through each respondent one by one.

Starting with Respondent15: Background_examination is 3, so that's out. 

Respondent12: Background_examination is 3, so no. 

Respondent17: Also 3. 

Respondent19: 3. 

Respondent4: Background_examination is 2. Now check the comments: ""Clinical handover and communication skills, satisfactory..."" The word 'communication' is there. So this counts.

Respondent23: Background_examination is 2. Comments: ""Talking to registrav could not summarize the condition of patient very clearly..."" No mention of 'communication'. So no.

Respondent21: Background_examination is 1. Skip.

Respondent8: Background_examination is 2. Comments: ""Clear communication during handover..."" 'Communication' is present. So this counts.

Respondent10: Background_examination is 2. Comments: ""Time: (15:53-16:14)"" No 'communication' here. 

Respondent1: Background_examination is 2. Comments: ""Satisfactory"" No 'communication'.

Respondent22: Background_examination is 3. So no.

So the respondents that meet both criteria are Respondent4 and Respondent8. That's two people. Therefore, the answer should be 2.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents who scored 3 on 'Background (examination)' also have 'Comments' that contain the word 'reflected'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find out how many respondents scored 3 on 'Background (examination)' and also have 'Comments' that include the word 'reflected'. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The 'Background_examination' predicate corresponds to the question about giving appropriate examination/observations, with a rubric from 0 to 3. A score of 3 means ""Comprehensive focused examination/observations"". 

Next, I need to look through all the respondents and check two things: 
1. Their 'Background_examination' score is 3.
2. Their 'Comments' field contains the word 'reflected'.

Looking at each respondent in the data:

- **Respondent10**: Background_examination is 2. Comments don't mention 'reflected'. → Doesn't qualify.
- **Respondent15**: Background_examination is 3. Comments are ""Detailed Response - clear communication"". No 'reflected' here. → Doesn't qualify.
- **Respondent21**: Background_examination is 1. → Excluded.
- **Respondent1**: Background_examination is 2. → Excluded.
- **Respondent2**: Background_examination is 3. Comments are empty. → No 'reflected'.
- **Respondent16**: Background_examination is 3. Comments mention ""Consent denied..."" and ""Satisfactory"". No 'reflected'. → Doesn't qualify.
- **Respondent13**: Background_examination is 1. → Excluded.
- **Respondent14**: Background_examination is 2. → Excluded.
- **Respondent11**: Background_examination is 3. Comments: ""Clear communication and handover"". No 'reflected'. → Doesn't qualify.
- **Respondent19**: Background_examination is 3. Comments mention ""Wrong CPR position..."" and ""Satisfactory"". No 'reflected'. → Doesn't qualify.
- **Respondent8**: Background_examination is 2. → Excluded.
- **Respondent12**: Background_examination is 3. Comments: ""Good"". No 'reflected'. → Doesn't qualify.

After checking all respondents, none of those who scored 3 in Background_examination have comments containing 'reflected'. So the count is 0.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and 'Background (history)' is greater than 5.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the number of respondents where the sum of their 'Recommendation_clear_recommendation' score and 'Background_history' score is greater than 5. 

First, I need to make sure I understand the data structure. The responses are listed for each respondent with various predicates. The relevant ones here are 'pred:Recommendation_clear_recommendation' and 'pred:Background_history'. Each of these has a numerical value assigned.

I'll go through each respondent one by one, extract those two scores, add them together, and check if the sum exceeds 5. Let's list out all the respondents and their scores:

- **Respondent3**: 
  - Recommendation_clear_recommendation: 3
  - Background_history: 3
  - Sum: 3 + 3 = 6 → which is greater than 5. So this counts.

- **Respondent23**:
  - Recommendation_clear_recommendation: 3
  - Background_history: 2
  - Sum: 3 + 2 = 5 → not greater than 5. Doesn't count.

- **Respondent11**:
  - Recommendation_clear_recommendation: 3
  - Background_history: 3
  - Sum: 6 → counts.

- **Respondent20**:
  - Recommendation_clear_recommendation: 2
  - Background_history: 2
  - Sum: 4 → doesn't count.

- **Respondent5**:
  - Recommendation_clear_recommendation: 2
  - Background_history: 3
  - Sum: 5 → doesn't count.

- **Respondent22**:
  - Recommendation_clear_recommendation: 2
  - Background_history: 3
  - Sum: 5 → doesn't count.

- **Respondent19**:
  - Recommendation_clear_recommendation: 3
  - Background_history: 3
  - Sum: 6 → counts.

- **Respondent9**:
  - Recommendation_clear_recommendation: 3
  - Background_history: 2
  - Sum: 5 → doesn't count.

- **Respondent10**:
  - Recommendation_clear_recommendation: 2
  - Background_history: 2
  - Sum: 4 → doesn't count.

- **Respondent21**:
  - Recommendation_clear_recommendation: 3
  - Background_history: 3
  - Sum: 6 → counts.

- **Respondent15**:
  - Recommendation_clear_recommendation: 2
  - Background_history: 2
  - Sum: 4 → doesn't count.

Now, tallying up the respondents that meet the criteria: Respondent3, Respondent11, Respondent19, Respondent21. That's a total of 4 respondents.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents from the '(MI)-VT' session scored 2 on 'Assessment' and 2 on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find out how many respondents from the '(MI)-VT' session scored 2 on 'Assessment' and 2 on 'Recommendation_clear_recommendation'. 

First, I need to identify all respondents who participated in the session named '(MI)-VT'. Looking through the responses, I'll check each respondent's 'SessionName' value. 

Looking at the data:

- Respondent10 has pred:SessionName ""(MI)-VT"". So that's one person in that session.

Now, for Respondent10, I need to check their scores for 'Assessment' and 'Recommendation_clear_recommendation'. 

Checking Respondent10's data:
- pred:Assessment ""2""
- pred:Recommendation_clear_recommendation ""2""

Both scores are 2, which matches the criteria. 

Are there any other respondents with SessionName '(MI)-VT'? Scanning through the rest of the responses, I don't see any other entries with that exact session name. 

So, only Respondent10 meets both conditions. Therefore, the count is 1.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents from the 'I-VF' session scored 2 on 'Assessment' and 3 on 'Situation'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find out how many respondents from the 'I-VF' session scored 2 on 'Assessment' and 3 on 'Situation'. 

First, I need to identify all respondents who participated in the 'I-VF' session. Looking at the responses section, each respondent has a pred:SessionName property. I'll go through each respondent one by one.

Starting with :Respondent7, their SessionName is ""III-Sepsis"" – not I-VF. :Respondent14 is ""IV-Hypoglycemia"". :Respondent15 is ""III - Sepsis"". :Respondent8 is ""III (Sepsis)"". :Respondent22 is ""IV (VT)"". :Respondent11 is ""IV (AF)"". :Respondent21's session is ""I (Myocardial infarction)"". :Respondent13 has SessionName ""I-VF"" – that's a match. :Respondent23 is ""II-Anaphylaxsis"". :Respondent12 is ""II (Anaphylaxis)"". :Respondent2's session is ""MI"". :Respondent6 is ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"". 

So only :Respondent13 is in the 'I-VF' session. Now, check their scores. For 'Assessment', the value is ""2"". For 'Situation', it's ""3"". Both conditions are met. 

Are there any other respondents in the I-VF session? From the data, no. So the count is 1.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents who scored 2 on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' also have 'Comments' that contain the word 'unclear'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find out how many respondents scored 2 on the 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and also have 'Comments' that include the word 'unclear'. 

First, I need to identify which predicate corresponds to the 'Recommendation (global rating scale)'. Looking at the questions section, the relevant predicate is pred:Recommendation_global_rating_scale. The rubric for this question is the GRS (Global Rating Scale) asking about confidence in receiving an accurate patient picture. The possible scores are 0 to 3.

Next, I need to go through each respondent in the responses section and check two things: 
1. Their score on pred:Recommendation_global_rating_scale is exactly 2.
2. Their Comments (pred:Comments) contain the word 'unclear' (case-insensitive, but the data seems to have exact matches).

Let's list out all respondents and their relevant data:

- **Respondent11**: GRS 3, Comments: ""Clear communication and handover"" → Doesn't meet either condition.
- **Respondent22**: GRS 3, Comments: ""Clear communication skills Good"" → No.
- **Respondent9**: GRS 2, Comments: ""Overall a bit unclear communication reflected"" → This one has GRS 2 and 'unclear' in comments. Count = 1.
- **Respondent12**: GRS 3 → No.
- **Respondent5**: GRS 3 → No.
- **Respondent16**: GRS 3 → No.
- **Respondent3**: GRS 3 → No.
- **Respondent17**: GRS 2, Comments: ""Concise - clear Satisfactory"" → GRS 2 but no 'unclear' → Doesn't count.
- **Respondent14**: GRS 2, Comments: Mentions ""Late response..."" but no 'unclear' → No.
- **Respondent2**: GRS 1 → No.
- **Respondent15**: GRS 2, Comments: ""Detailed Response - clear communication"" → GRS 2 but no 'unclear' → No.

So, only Respondent9 meets both criteria. Therefore, the count is 1.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents from the 'IV - VT' session scored 2 on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 3 on 'Situation'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The question is asking how many respondents from the 'IV - VT' session scored 2 on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 3 on 'Situation'. 

First, I need to identify which respondents are part of the 'IV - VT' session. Looking at the responses, each respondent has a pred:SessionName property. I'll go through each one:

- Respondent4: SessionName is ""III (Sepsis)"" – not IV - VT.
- Respondent12: ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" – nope.
- Respondent5: ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" – no.
- Respondent18: ""IV - VT"" – yes, this one matches.
- Respondent2: ""MI"" – no.
- Respondent20: ""IV (VT)"" – Hmm, the session name here is written as ""IV (VT)"". The question specifies 'IV - VT', but I need to check if these are considered the same. Since both have IV and VT, just different punctuation, I should count this as the same session.
- Respondent11: ""IV (AF)"" – different.
- Respondent23: ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" – no.
- Respondent7: ""III-Sepsis"" – no.
- Respondent6: ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"" – no.
- Respondent17: ""V (Hypoglycemia)"" – no.

So, the respondents in the IV - VT session are Respondent18 and Respondent20. Wait, Respondent20's SessionName is ""IV (VT)"", but the question is about 'IV - VT'. The hyphens and parentheses might be different, but the session is likely the same, just formatted differently. So both should be considered.

Next, for these two respondents, check their scores on 'Recommendation_global_rating_scale' and 'Situation'.

Looking at Respondent18:
- pred:Recommendation_global_rating_scale is ""2""
- pred:Situation is ""3""
So this one meets both conditions.

Respondent20:
- pred:Recommendation_global_rating_scale is ""3""
- pred:Situation is ""3""
Here, the global rating scale is 3, which doesn't meet the 2 requirement. So only Respondent18 qualifies.

Wait, but the question is about 'IV - VT' session. Respondent18's SessionName is ""IV - VT"" exactly, and Respondent20's is ""IV (VT)"". The original example in the data shows that the answer was 2 for a session named 'I - MI', but in the data, Respondent2's SessionName is ""MI"". So maybe the way the session is named can vary, but the key part is the session identifier. However, in the current task, the user is specifically asking for 'IV - VT', which is the exact name in Respondent18. Respondent20's session is ""IV (VT)"", which might be considered a different session. Let me check the data again.

In the data provided, the sessions have variations in naming, like ""II (Anaphylaxis)"", ""II - Anaphylaxsis"", ""II-Anaphylaxsis"", etc. So perhaps the session names are case-insensitive and variations in punctuation (like hyphens vs parentheses) are considered the same. But the question specifically asks for 'IV - VT', so maybe only Respondent18 is counted. However, in the example given, the answer was 2 for 'I - MI' session, but in the data, only Respondent2 has ""MI"" as the session name. That suggests that the session name might be considered the same even if the ""I -"" part is missing. Wait, the example's answer was 2, but in the data provided in the example, only Respondent2 has SessionName ""MI"". But the example's answer is 2. That seems conflicting. Wait, maybe the example data is different from the current data. Let me check the example again.

In the example data, the answer was 2 for the 'I - MI' session. Looking at the example's responses, there's Respondent2 with SessionName ""MI"" and another respondent? Wait, in the example data, the answer is 2, but looking at the example responses, only Respondent2 has SessionName ""MI"". So perhaps there was a mistake in the example. But in the current task, the data is different. So perhaps in the current data, the user is using a different dataset. 

But in the current task's data, the respondents with IV-related sessions are Respondent18 (""IV - VT"") and Respondent20 (""IV (VT)""). If the question is strict about the exact session name ""IV - VT"", then only Respondent18 counts. However, if variations like ""IV (VT)"" are considered the same session, then both might be included. But the question specifies 'IV - VT', so I should stick to exact matches unless the data shows that different formats are considered the same. 

Looking at the data, for example, ""II (Anaphylaxis)"", ""II - Anaphylaxsis"", ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" are all variations of Session II Anaphylaxis. So perhaps the session names are considered the same even with different punctuation. But the user's question is about ""IV - VT"", so if ""IV (VT)"" is considered the same, then Respondent20 would be part of that session. However, the hyphen vs parentheses might indicate different sessions. For example, ""IV - VT"" could be a different scenario from ""IV (VT)"". But without additional context, it's safer to assume exact string match unless told otherwise. 

Therefore, only Respondent18 has SessionName ""IV - VT"". Now check their scores. Respondent18 has Recommendation_global_rating_scale ""2"" and Situation ""3"" – both conditions met. Respondent20 has SessionName ""IV (VT)"", which is different, so not counted. 

Therefore, the answer is 1.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 'Assessment' is greater than 5.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents whose total score for 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 'Assessment' is greater than 5. 

First, I need to make sure I understand the data structure. The 'Recommendation_global_rating_scale' and 'Assessment' are two different predicates in the responses. Each respondent has a value for these. The question is asking for the sum of these two values to be greater than 5.

Looking at the questions section, the 'QRecommendation_global_rating_scale' has a rubric from 0 to 3, and the 'QAssessment' also has a rubric from 0 to 3. So the maximum possible sum for these two would be 6 (3+3). The threshold here is greater than 5, so the sum needs to be 6.

Now, I need to go through each respondent and check their scores for these two categories. Let's list out all the respondents and their respective scores.

Starting with Respondent2:
- Recommendation_global_rating_scale: 1
- Assessment: 3
Sum: 1 + 3 = 4 → Not greater than 5.

Respondent10:
- Recommendation_global_rating_scale: 2
- Assessment: 2
Sum: 2 + 2 = 4 → No.

Respondent20:
- Recommendation_global_rating_scale: 3
- Assessment: 3
Sum: 3 + 3 = 6 → Yes. This one counts.

Respondent22:
- Recommendation_global_rating_scale: 3
- Assessment: 2
Sum: 3 + 2 = 5 → Not greater than 5.

Respondent12:
- Recommendation_global_rating_scale: 3
- Assessment: 2
Sum: 5 → No.

Respondent4:
- Recommendation_global_rating_scale: 2
- Assessment: 2
Sum: 4 → No.

Respondent17:
- Recommendation_global_rating_scale: 2
- Assessment: 3
Sum: 5 → No.

Respondent7:
- Recommendation_global_rating_scale: 2
- Assessment: 2
Sum: 4 → No.

Respondent3:
- Recommendation_global_rating_scale: 3
- Assessment: 3
Sum: 6 → Yes. Count this one.

Respondent11:
- Recommendation_global_rating_scale: 3
- Assessment: 3
Sum: 6 → Yes. Another one.

Respondent8:
- Recommendation_global_rating_scale: 3
- Assessment: 2
Sum: 5 → No.

So, the respondents who meet the criteria are Respondent20, Respondent3, and Respondent11. That's three respondents. Wait, but let me double-check each entry to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Looking again:

Respondent20: 3 (GRS) + 3 (Assessment) = 6 ✅
Respondent3: 3 + 3 = 6 ✅
Respondent11: 3 + 3 = 6 ✅

Yes, three respondents. But wait, the example given in the problem had an answer of 2. Wait, no, the example was a different question. The current task is different. The example was about counting MI sessions, but the current task is about the sum of GRS and Assessment. So the example's answer isn't relevant here.

Wait, but in the data provided, let me check again:

Wait, in the data, the respondents are:

Respondent20: GRS 3, Assessment 3 → 6
Respondent3: GRS 3, Assessment 3 → 6
Respondent11: GRS 3, Assessment 3 → 6

That's three. Are there any others?

Wait, let me check all again:

Respondent2: GRS 1, Assessment 3 → 4
Respondent10: GRS 2, Assessment 2 →4
Respondent20: 3+3=6 ✅
Respondent22:3+2=5
Respondent12:3+2=5
Respondent4:2+2=4
Respondent17:2+3=5
Respondent7:2+2=4
Respondent3:3+3=6 ✅
Respondent11:3+3=6 ✅
Respondent8:3+2=5

So three respondents: 20, 3, 11. So the answer should be 3. But wait, let me check if I missed any other respondents. The list includes up to Respondent22, but let's confirm all the respondents in the data:

Looking at the responses section, the respondents listed are:

Respondent2, 10, 20, 22, 12, 4, 17, 7, 3, 11, 8. That's 11 respondents total.

So from these, three have a sum of 6. Therefore, the answer should be 3.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents from the 'II (Anaphylaxis)' session scored 3 on 'Background (examination)' and 3 on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The question is asking how many respondents from the 'II (Anaphylaxis)' session scored 3 on 'Background (examination)' and 3 on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)'. 

First, I need to make sure I understand the data structure. The responses are listed with each respondent having various predicates like pred:SessionName, pred:Background_examination, and pred:Recommendation_clear_recommendation. The task is to count the number of respondents where:

1. SessionName is exactly ""II (Anaphylaxis)"".
2. Background_examination is ""3"".
3. Recommendation_clear_recommendation is ""3"".

Looking at the data, let's go through each respondent one by one.

Starting with Respondent4: Their SessionName is ""III (Sepsis)"", so that's not a match. Skip.

Respondent12: SessionName is ""II (Anaphylaxis)"". Background_examination is ""3"", and Recommendation_clear_recommendation is ""3"". This looks like a match. So count 1.

Respondent18: SessionName is ""IV - VT"". Not matching. Skip.

Respondent22: SessionName is ""IV (VT)"". Not matching. Skip.

Respondent23: SessionName is ""II-Anaphylaxsis"". Wait, the question specifies ""II (Anaphylaxis)"". The spelling here is ""Anaphylaxsis"" with an extra 's'. Is that considered the same? The example given in the data shows ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" and ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" as different session names. For example, Respondent9 has ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"" with two 's's. So the exact session name must be ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" as per the question. Therefore, Respondent23's session name is different. So not a match.

Respondent9: SessionName is ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"" with two 's's. So not matching the exact ""II (Anaphylaxis)"". So skip.

Respondent8: SessionName is ""III (Sepsis)"". Not a match.

Respondent14: SessionName is ""IV-Hypoglycemia"". Not a match.

Respondent16: SessionName is ""I - MI"". Not a match.

So the only respondent that matches all three criteria is Respondent12. Therefore, the answer should be 1.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents who scored 3 on 'Background (examination)' also have 'Comments' that contain the word 'unclear'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking: How many respondents who scored 3 on 'Background (examination)' also have 'Comments' that contain the word 'unclear'? 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The data provided includes several respondents, each with various scores and comments. The task involves two main criteria: a score of 3 in the 'Background_examination' field and the presence of the word 'unclear' in their 'Comments'.

Let me start by identifying all respondents who have a score of 3 in 'Background_examination'. Looking through each respondent's data:

- Respondent20: Background_examination is ""-1"" → Not 3.
- Respondent23: Background_examination is ""2"" → No.
- Respondent21: Background_examination is ""1"" → No.
- Respondent18: ""2"" → No.
- Respondent1: ""2"" → No.
- Respondent9: ""2"" → No.
- Respondent19: Background_examination is ""3"" → Yes.
- Respondent6: ""3"" → Yes.
- Respondent5: ""3"" → Yes.
- Respondent12: ""3"" → Yes.
- Respondent13: ""1"" → No.
- Respondent15: ""3"" → Yes.

So, the respondents with a score of 3 in Background_examination are: Respondent19, Respondent6, Respondent5, Respondent12, and Respondent15. That's five respondents.

Next, I need to check the 'Comments' of each of these five to see if they contain the word 'unclear'. Let's go through each one:

- Respondent19: Comments are ""Wrong CPR position, Clarity is a bit low over whole case scenario, Satisfactory."" The word 'unclear' isn't here, but 'Clarity is a bit low' might be similar. However, the exact word 'unclear' is not present. So, no.

- Respondent6: Comments are empty (""""). So, no.

- Respondent5: Comments are ""Good clear and precise clinical handover, Good."" No 'unclear' here.

- Respondent12: Comments are ""Good."" No.

- Respondent15: Comments are ""Detailed Response - clear communication."" Again, no 'unclear'.

Wait, but I might have missed someone. Let me check again. The respondents with Background_examination 3 are 19,6,5,12,15. None of their comments include 'unclear'. 

Wait, but looking back at the data, maybe I missed another respondent. Let me check all the 'Background_examination' entries again to confirm:

- Respondent19: 3 → Comments: ""Wrong CPR position Clarity is a bit low over whole case scenario Satisfactory"" → 'unclear' not present.

- Respondent6: 3 → Comments: """".

- Respondent5: 3 → Comments: ""Good clear and precise clinical handover Good"".

- Respondent12: 3 → Comments: ""Good"".

- Respondent15: 3 → Comments: ""Detailed Response - clear communication"".

So none of these have 'unclear' in their comments. But wait, let's check other respondents who might have 'unclear' in comments but not a 3 in Background_examination. For example, Respondent9 has comments ""Overall a bit unclear communication reflected"" and their Background_examination is 2. So they have 'unclear' but their score is 2, so they don't count. Similarly, Respondent18's comments mention ""Not very concise or clear communication"" but their Background_examination is 2. Respondent19's comment has ""Clarity is a bit low"" but not 'unclear'. 

Therefore, among the five respondents with a score of 3 in Background_examination, none have 'unclear' in their comments. So the answer should be 0.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who participated in a session where the average 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' for that session name is greater than 2.5.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents who participated in a session where the average 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' for that session name is greater than 2.5. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The data has respondents, each associated with a SessionName and a Recommendation_global_rating_scale value. The goal is to group respondents by their SessionName, calculate the average of the global rating scale for each session, and then count how many respondents are in sessions where that average is above 2.5.

Let me start by listing all the respondents and their SessionNames along with their global rating scores. 

Looking at the responses:

- Respondent12: SessionName ""II (Anaphylaxis)"", GRS 3
- Respondent1: ""V (Hypoglycemia)"", GRS 2
- Respondent6: ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"", GRS 3
- Respondent5: ""II - Anaphylaxsis"", GRS 3
- Respondent19: ""I - MI"", GRS 3
- Respondent13: ""I-VF"", GRS 2
- Respondent3: ""III-Sepsis"", GRS 3
- Respondent20: ""IV (VT)"", GRS 3
- Respondent23: ""II-Anaphylaxsis"", GRS 3
- Respondent11: ""IV (AF)"", GRS 3

Now, I need to group these by SessionName. Let's note that some session names might be variations but refer to the same session. For example, ""II (Anaphylaxis)"", ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"", ""II - Anaphylaxsis"", and ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" might all be different ways of writing the same session, but I need to check if they are considered the same or different. However, according to the data, each SessionName is a string, so exact matches are required unless specified otherwise. The problem doesn't mention normalizing session names, so I have to treat them as distinct if their names are different.

Wait, but looking at the example given in the problem, the answer was 2 for a session named ""I - MI"". Let me check the example data again. In the example, the answer was 2, and looking at the data, only Respondent19 has SessionName ""I - MI"". But the answer was 2. Wait, that might be a different example. Wait, no, in the example provided, the answer was 2, but in the data given, there's only one respondent with ""I - MI"". Hmm, maybe the example is a different scenario. But in the current task, I need to focus on the data provided here.

Wait, the current task is different. Let me focus on the current data. Let's list all SessionNames and their corresponding GRS scores:

1. II (Anaphylaxis) - Respondent12: GRS 3
2. V (Hypoglycemia) - Respondent1: GRS 2
3. II (Anaphylactic Shock) - Respondent6: GRS 3
4. II - Anaphylaxsis - Respondent5: GRS 3
5. I - MI - Respondent19: GRS 3
6. I-VF - Respondent13: GRS 2
7. III-Sepsis - Respondent3: GRS 3
8. IV (VT) - Respondent20: GRS 3
9. II-Anaphylaxsis - Respondent23: GRS 3
10. IV (AF) - Respondent11: GRS 3

Now, group by SessionName and calculate the average GRS for each:

- ""II (Anaphylaxis)"": [3] → average 3
- ""V (Hypoglycemia)"": [2] → average 2
- ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"": [3] → average 3
- ""II - Anaphylaxsis"": [3] → average 3
- ""I - MI"": [3] → average 3
- ""I-VF"": [2] → average 2
- ""III-Sepsis"": [3] → average 3
- ""IV (VT)"": [3] → average 3
- ""II-Anaphylaxsis"": [3] → average 3
- ""IV (AF)"": [3] → average 3

Wait, but some session names might have multiple respondents. For example, if multiple respondents are in the same session, their GRS scores would be averaged. But looking at the data, each SessionName here seems to have only one respondent. Let me check again:

Looking through the list, each SessionName in the responses is unique except for possible variations. For example, ""II (Anaphylaxis)"", ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"", ""II - Anaphylaxsis"", and ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" might be different sessions or the same with typos. But according to the data, they are written differently, so they are considered different sessions. For example, Respondent5's session is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"", while Respondent23's is ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" (without space after II). Are these considered the same? The problem doesn't mention normalizing session names, so we have to treat them as separate. Similarly, ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"" is different from ""II (Anaphylaxis)"".

Therefore, each SessionName in the data is unique to a single respondent. Therefore, each session's average GRS is just the GRS of that single respondent. 

So, the average for each session is the same as the individual's GRS. Now, the task is to find sessions where the average GRS is >2.5. Since the GRS is on a scale of 0-3, a value of 3 is 3.0, which is above 2.5. A value of 2 is 2.0, which is below. 

So, any session where the GRS is 3 would have an average of 3.0, which is above 2.5. Sessions with GRS 2 would have average 2.0, which is below. 

Now, count the respondents in sessions where the average GRS >2.5. Since each session here has only one respondent, the count would be the number of respondents with GRS 3. 

Looking at the data:

- Respondent12: GRS 3 → included
- Respondent1: GRS 2 → excluded
- Respondent6: GRS 3 → included
- Respondent5: GRS 3 → included
- Respondent19: GRS 3 → included
- Respondent13: GRS 2 → excluded
- Respondent3: GRS 3 → included
- Respondent20: GRS 3 → included
- Respondent23: GRS 3 → included
- Respondent11: GRS 3 → included

Wait, let's list all GRS values:

- Respondent12: 3
- Respondent1: 2
- Respondent6: 3
- Respondent5: 3
- Respondent19: 3
- Respondent13: 2
- Respondent3: 3
- Respondent20: 3
- Respondent23: 3
- Respondent11: 3

So, how many have GRS 3? Let's count:

1. Respondent12
2. Respondent6
3. Respondent5
4. Respondent19
5. Respondent3
6. Respondent20
7. Respondent23
8. Respondent11

That's 8 respondents. But wait, the example in the problem had an answer of 2 for a different question. But in this case, according to the data provided, there are 8 respondents with GRS 3, each in their own session (since each session name is unique), so all these 8 sessions have an average of 3.0, which is above 2.5. Therefore, the count should be 8.

Wait, but let me double-check. The task says ""count the respondents who participated in a session where the average..."". So even if a session has multiple respondents, we count all of them if the session's average is >2.5. But in this data, each session has only one respondent, so each of those 8 respondents is in a session with average 3.0. The other two (Respondent1 and Respondent13) have GRS 2, so their sessions' averages are 2.0, which is below 2.5, so they are excluded. 

Therefore, the total number of respondents is 8. But wait, let me check again:

Total respondents: 10.

Respondents with GRS 3: 8 (as listed above).

So the answer should be 8. But wait, let me check the data again to make sure I didn't miscount.

Looking at each respondent:

- Respondent12: GRS 3 → yes
- Respondent1: 2 → no
- Respondent6: 3 → yes
- Respondent5: 3 → yes
- Respondent19:3 → yes
- Respondent13:2 → no
- Respondent3:3 → yes
- Respondent20:3 → yes
- Respondent23:3 → yes
- Respondent11:3 → yes

That's 8 respondents. So the answer is 8. But wait, the example given in the problem had an answer of 2, but that was for a different question. So in this case, the correct answer should be 8. However, I need to make sure that there are no sessions with multiple respondents. Let me check again.

Looking at the data:

Each respondent has a unique SessionName. For example, ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" is only Respondent12. ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"" is Respondent6. ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" is Respondent5. ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" is Respondent23. So even though these might be similar, they are different session names. Therefore, each is a separate session with one respondent. Therefore, all 8 respondents with GRS 3 are in sessions where the average is 3.0, which is above 2.5. So the count is 8.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who participated in a session where the average 'Situation' for that session name is greater than 2.0.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents who participated in a session where the average 'Situation' score for that session name is greater than 2.0. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The data includes several respondents, each with a 'SessionName' and a 'Situation' score. The 'Situation' score is a rubric-based value ranging from 0 to 3. The goal is to group respondents by their SessionName, calculate the average Situation score for each session, and then count how many respondents are in sessions where that average is above 2.0.

Let me start by listing all the respondents and their SessionNames along with their Situation scores:

- Respondent3: SessionName ""III-Sepsis"", Situation ""2""
- Respondent17: SessionName ""V (Hypoglycemia)"", Situation ""3""
- Respondent7: SessionName ""III-Sepsis"", Situation ""3""
- Respondent13: SessionName ""I-VF"", Situation ""3""
- Respondent14: SessionName ""IV-Hypoglycemia"", Situation ""3""
- Respondent15: SessionName ""III - Sepsis"", Situation ""3""
- Respondent11: SessionName ""IV (AF)"", Situation ""3""
- Respondent6: SessionName ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"", Situation ""2""

Wait, I notice that some SessionNames might be similar but written differently. For example, ""III-Sepsis"" and ""III - Sepsis"" – are these considered the same session? The data might have typos or formatting differences. I need to check if these are intended to be the same session. Since the names are slightly different, but the content seems similar (both Sepsis), I should probably treat them as separate unless there's a clear indication they are the same. However, in the data, Respondent3 and Respondent7 have ""III-Sepsis"", while Respondent15 has ""III - Sepsis"". The hyphen placement differs. Without explicit information that these are the same, I have to consider them as different sessions. So, ""III-Sepsis"" and ""III - Sepsis"" are separate session names.

Now, let's group the respondents by their SessionName and calculate the average Situation score for each group.

1. **III-Sepsis**:
   - Respondent3: Situation 2
   - Respondent7: Situation 3
   - Total respondents: 2
   - Sum: 2 + 3 = 5
   - Average: 5 / 2 = 2.5

2. **V (Hypoglycemia)**:
   - Respondent17: Situation 3
   - Average: 3 / 1 = 3.0

3. **I-VF**:
   - Respondent13: Situation 3
   - Average: 3 / 1 = 3.0

4. **IV-Hypoglycemia**:
   - Respondent14: Situation 3
   - Average: 3 / 1 = 3.0

5. **III - Sepsis**:
   - Respondent15: Situation 3
   - Average: 3 / 1 = 3.0

6. **IV (AF)**:
   - Respondent11: Situation 3
   - Average: 3 / 1 = 3.0

7. **II (Anaphylactic Shock)**:
   - Respondent6: Situation 2
   - Average: 2 / 1 = 2.0

Now, we need to find which sessions have an average Situation score greater than 2.0. Let's check each:

- III-Sepsis: 2.5 > 2.0 → Yes
- V (Hypoglycemia): 3.0 > 2.0 → Yes
- I-VF: 3.0 > 2.0 → Yes
- IV-Hypoglycemia: 3.0 > 2.0 → Yes
- III - Sepsis: 3.0 > 2.0 → Yes
- IV (AF): 3.0 > 2.0 → Yes
- II (Anaphylactic Shock): 2.0 is not greater than 2.0 → No

So, the sessions that qualify are: III-Sepsis, V (Hypoglycemia), I-VF, IV-Hypoglycemia, III - Sepsis, IV (AF). 

Now, count the number of respondents in each of these qualifying sessions:

- III-Sepsis: 2 respondents (Respondent3, Respondent7)
- V (Hypoglycemia): 1 (Respondent17)
- I-VF: 1 (Respondent13)
- IV-Hypoglycemia: 1 (Respondent14)
- III - Sepsis: 1 (Respondent15)
- IV (AF): 1 (Respondent11)

Total respondents = 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7

Wait, but let me double-check the SessionNames again. The problem is that ""III-Sepsis"" and ""III - Sepsis"" are considered separate sessions here. If they were actually the same session, the average would be calculated across all three respondents (Respondent3, Respondent7, Respondent15). Let's see:

If ""III-Sepsis"" and ""III - Sepsis"" are the same session (assuming a typo), then:

Total respondents in that session: 3 (Respondent3, Respondent7, Respondent15)
Sum of Situation scores: 2 + 3 + 3 = 8
Average: 8 / 3 ≈ 2.666..., which is still greater than 2.0. Then the total respondents in qualifying sessions would be:

III-Sepsis (merged): 3
V (Hypoglycemia):1
I-VF:1
IV-Hypoglycemia:1
IV (AF):1
Total: 3+1+1+1+1=7

But the original calculation treated them as separate, leading to 2 in III-Sepsis and 1 in III - Sepsis. However, the problem statement doesn't mention any merging of session names, so we have to take the SessionName exactly as given. Therefore, ""III-Sepsis"" and ""III - Sepsis"" are different sessions. So the initial calculation of 7 respondents is correct.

Wait, but in the data, Respondent15's SessionName is ""III - Sepsis"" with a space around the hyphen, while others are ""III-Sepsis"". Since the SessionName is an open-ended field, these are considered different unless specified otherwise. Therefore, they are separate sessions. So each of these sessions has an average above 2.0. Therefore, the total respondents in qualifying sessions are:

III-Sepsis: 2
V (Hypoglycemia):1
I-VF:1
IV-Hypoglycemia:1
III - Sepsis:1
IV (AF):1
Total: 2+1+1+1+1+1=7

But wait, the answer in the example was 2. Wait, the example had a different dataset. Wait, no, the example is separate. The current task is on the questionnaire data provided. The example was part of the instruction but the actual data to process is in the <questionnaire> section. Let me confirm the data again.

Looking back at the responses in the questionnaire section:

- Respondent3: III-Sepsis
- Respondent7: III-Sepsis
- Respondent15: III - Sepsis

So, three different sessions: III-Sepsis (2 respondents), III - Sepsis (1 respondent), and others. Each of these sessions has an average above 2.0. So the total respondents in qualifying sessions are 2 (III-Sepsis) +1 (V Hypoglycemia) +1 (I-VF) +1 (IV-Hypoglycemia) +1 (III - Sepsis) +1 (IV (AF)) = 7. But the example answer was 2, but that was for a different question. Wait, the example was about a different session name. The current task is different.

Wait, the example's answer was 2, but that's for a different question. The current task is to count respondents in sessions where the session's average Situation is >2.0. So according to the data, the answer should be 7. But let me check again.

Wait, let's list all sessions and their averages:

1. III-Sepsis: 2 respondents (Situation scores 2 and 3) → average 2.5
2. V (Hypoglycemia): 1 respondent (3) → 3.0
3. I-VF: 1 respondent (3) → 3.0
4. IV-Hypoglycemia: 1 respondent (3) → 3.0
5. III - Sepsis: 1 respondent (3) → 3.0
6. IV (AF): 1 respondent (3) → 3.0
7. II (Anaphylactic Shock): 1 respondent (2) → 2.0

Sessions with average >2.0: all except II (Anaphylactic Shock). So the qualifying sessions are the first six. The number of respondents in these sessions is 2+1+1+1+1+1=7. Therefore, the answer should be 7. But wait, the example answer was 2, but that's for a different question. So in this case, the correct answer is 7. But let me check again to make sure.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting. Let me list each respondent and their session's average:

- Respondent3: III-Sepsis (average 2.5) → included
- Respondent7: III-Sepsis (average 2.5) → included
- Respondent17: V (Hypoglycemia) (average 3.0) → included
- Respondent13: I-VF (average 3.0) → included
- Respondent14: IV-Hypoglycemia (average 3.0) → included
- Respondent15: III - Sepsis (average 3.0) → included
- Respondent11: IV (AF) (average 3.0) → included
- Respondent6: II (Anaphylactic Shock) (average 2.0) → excluded

So total included respondents: 7. Therefore, the answer is 7. But I need to make sure that the SessionNames are treated as case-sensitive and exact matches. For example, ""III-Sepsis"" vs ""III - Sepsis"" are different. So each is a separate session. Therefore, each of those sessions has their own average. Since each of those sessions (except II) has an average >2.0, the respondents in those sessions are counted. So 7 respondents in total.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who participated in a session where the average 'Background (examination)' for that session name is greater than 2.0.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents who participated in a session where the average 'Background (examination)' score for that session name is greater than 2.0. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The data includes multiple respondents, each with a 'SessionName' and a 'Background_examination' score. The 'Background_examination' is a rubric-based score ranging from 0 to 3. 

The goal is to group respondents by their SessionName, calculate the average Background_examination score for each session, and then count how many respondents are in sessions where this average is above 2.0.

Let me start by listing all the respondents and their SessionName along with their Background_examination scores:

- Respondent10: SessionName ""(MI)-VT"", Background_examination 2
- Respondent11: SessionName ""IV (AF)"", Background_examination 3
- Respondent19: SessionName ""I - MI"", Background_examination 3
- Respondent20: SessionName ""IV (VT)"", Background_examination -1 (Wait, but the rubric is 0-3. Hmm, maybe a typo? But according to the data, it's -1. I'll have to consider it as is, but maybe it's an error. However, the problem doesn't mention handling invalid data, so I'll proceed with the given value.)
- Respondent3: SessionName ""III-Sepsis"", Background_examination 3
- Respondent2: SessionName ""MI"", Background_examination 3
- Respondent5: SessionName ""II - Anaphylaxsis"", Background_examination 3
- Respondent6: SessionName ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"", Background_examination 3
- Respondent13: SessionName ""I-VF"", Background_examination 1
- Respondent23: SessionName ""II-Anaphylaxsis"", Background_examination 2

Now, group them by SessionName:

1. ""(MI)-VT"": [2] (only Respondent10)
2. ""IV (AF)"": [3] (Respondent11)
3. ""I - MI"": [3] (Respondent19)
4. ""IV (VT)"": [-1] (Respondent20)
5. ""III-Sepsis"": [3] (Respondent3)
6. ""MI"": [3] (Respondent2)
7. ""II - Anaphylaxsis"": [3] (Respondent5)
8. ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"": [3] (Respondent6)
9. ""I-VF"": [1] (Respondent13)
10. ""II-Anaphylaxsis"": [2] (Respondent23)

Wait, but some session names might be the same but written differently. For example, ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" and ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" – are these considered the same session? The problem states to group by the exact SessionName. Since the names are slightly different (hyphen vs. space), they are treated as separate sessions. Similarly, ""IV (AF)"" and ""IV (VT)"" are different. ""MI"" and ""I - MI"" are different session names. So each unique SessionName string is a separate group.

Now, calculate the average for each group:

1. ""(MI)-VT"": average = 2.0 → not greater than 2.0
2. ""IV (AF)"": average = 3.0 → greater than 2.0
3. ""I - MI"": average = 3.0 → greater than 2.0
4. ""IV (VT)"": average = -1.0 → not
5. ""III-Sepsis"": average = 3.0 → greater than 2.0
6. ""MI"": average = 3.0 → greater than 2.0
7. ""II - Anaphylaxsis"": average = 3.0 → greater than 2.0
8. ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"": average = 3.0 → greater than 2.0
9. ""I-VF"": average = 1.0 → not
10. ""II-Anaphylaxsis"": average = 2.0 → not (since 2.0 is not greater than 2.0)

Now, the sessions with average >2.0 are:

- ""IV (AF)""
- ""I - MI""
- ""III-Sepsis""
- ""MI""
- ""II - Anaphylaxsis""
- ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)""

Each of these sessions has an average Background_examination score above 2.0.

Now, count the number of respondents in each of these sessions:

- ""IV (AF)"": 1 (Respondent11)
- ""I - MI"": 1 (Respondent19)
- ""III-Sepsis"": 1 (Respondent3)
- ""MI"": 1 (Respondent2)
- ""II - Anaphylaxsis"": 1 (Respondent5)
- ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"": 1 (Respondent6)

Total respondents in qualifying sessions: 1+1+1+1+1+1 = 6.

Wait, but let me double-check each session's respondents:

- ""IV (AF)"": only Respondent11
- ""I - MI"": only Respondent19
- ""III-Sepsis"": only Respondent3
- ""MI"": only Respondent2
- ""II - Anaphylaxsis"": only Respondent5
- ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"": only Respondent6

Yes, each of these sessions has one respondent. So total 6 respondents.

But wait, the example given in the initial data had an answer of 2 for a similar question. But that was a different question (session name ""I - MI"" had 1 respondent, and the answer was 2, but maybe that was a different scenario). However, in this task, the answer is 6. But let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in grouping. Let me recheck the SessionNames and their respondents:

Looking back:

- Respondent10: ""(MI)-VT"" → 1
- Respondent11: ""IV (AF)"" → 1
- Respondent19: ""I - MI"" →1
- Respondent20: ""IV (VT)"" →1
- Respondent3: ""III-Sepsis"" →1
- Respondent2: ""MI"" →1
- Respondent5: ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" →1
- Respondent6: ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"" →1
- Respondent13: ""I-VF"" →1
- Respondent23: ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" →1

Each session name is unique except perhaps ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" and ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" (with and without space). But in the data, Respondent5 has ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" and Respondent23 has ""II-Anaphylaxsis"". So they are different sessions. Therefore, each session has only one respondent. Therefore, the average for each of the qualifying sessions is 3.0 (except ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"" which is 3.0, so average is 3.0). So all those 6 sessions have average >2.0, each with 1 respondent, totaling 6.

But wait, the answer in the example was 2, but that was for a different question. The current task is different. So according to the current data, the answer should be 6. But let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck each session's average:

1. ""(MI)-VT"": 2 → average 2.0 → not >2.0
2. ""IV (AF)"": 3 → average 3.0 → yes
3. ""I - MI"": 3 → average 3.0 → yes
4. ""IV (VT)"": -1 → average -1.0 → no
5. ""III-Sepsis"": 3 → average 3.0 → yes
6. ""MI"": 3 → average 3.0 → yes
7. ""II - Anaphylaxsis"": 3 → average 3.0 → yes
8. ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"": 3 → average 3.0 → yes
9. ""I-VF"": 1 → average 1.0 → no
10. ""II-Anaphylaxsis"": 2 → average 2.0 → no

So sessions 2,3,5,6,7,8 have averages >2.0. Each has 1 respondent, so total 6. Therefore, the answer should be 6. But wait, the example answer was 2, but that was for a different question. However, in this case, according to the data provided, the answer is 6. But let me check again if I missed any sessions with multiple respondents.

Wait, looking at the data again, are there any sessions with the same name but different respondents? For example, ""MI"" and ""I - MI"" are different. ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" and ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" are different. So each session has only one respondent. Therefore, the count is 6.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who participated in a session where the average 'Assessment' for that session name is greater than 2.5.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents who participated in a session where the average 'Assessment' score for that session name is greater than 2.5. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The data provided includes multiple respondents, each with a 'SessionName' and an 'Assessment' score. The 'Assessment' is a rubric-based score ranging from 0 to 3. 

The plan is to:
1. Group all respondents by their 'SessionName'.
2. For each session, calculate the average 'Assessment' score.
3. Identify which sessions have an average greater than 2.5.
4. Count all respondents that belong to those sessions.

Let's start by listing all the respondents and their SessionNames along with their Assessment scores.

Looking at the data:

- Respondent22: SessionName ""IV (VT)"", Assessment ""2""
- Respondent3: SessionName ""III-Sepsis"", Assessment ""3""
- Respondent9: SessionName ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"", Assessment ""2""
- Respondent15: SessionName ""III - Sepsis"", Assessment ""2""
- Respondent14: SessionName ""IV-Hypoglycemia"", Assessment ""3""
- Respondent16: SessionName ""I - MI"", Assessment ""3""
- Respondent20: SessionName ""IV (VT)"", Assessment ""3""
- Respondent19: SessionName ""I - MI"", Assessment ""2""

Wait, I need to make sure I get the SessionNames exactly as they are. Let me check again:

- Respondent3: ""III-Sepsis""
- Respondent15: ""III - Sepsis"" (note the space after III and before the dash)
- Respondent16 and 19: ""I - MI""
- Respondent22 and 20: ""IV (VT)"" and ""IV (VT)""
- Respondent9: ""II (Anaphylaxsis)""
- Respondent14: ""IV-Hypoglycemia""

Hmm, some session names might be similar but have different formatting. For example, ""III-Sepsis"" vs. ""III - Sepsis"". Are these considered the same session? The problem statement doesn't mention normalizing session names, so I should treat them as different if the names aren't exactly the same. Similarly, ""IV (VT)"" and ""IV (VT)"" are the same, but ""IV-Hypoglycemia"" is different.

Now, let's group by SessionName and calculate the average Assessment for each.

Starting with ""IV (VT)"":
- Respondents: 22 (Assessment 2) and 20 (Assessment 3)
- Total = 2 + 3 = 5
- Average = 5/2 = 2.5. Since the requirement is greater than 2.5, this session doesn't qualify.

Next, ""III-Sepsis"":
- Respondent3: Assessment 3
- Only one respondent. Average is 3.0. 3.0 is greater than 2.5, so this session qualifies.

""III - Sepsis"":
- Respondent15: Assessment 2
- Average is 2.0. Doesn't qualify.

""II (Anaphylaxsis)"":
- Respondent9: Assessment 2
- Average 2.0. Doesn't qualify.

""IV-Hypoglycemia"":
- Respondent14: Assessment 3
- Average 3.0. Qualifies.

""I - MI"":
- Respondents 16 (Assessment 3) and 19 (Assessment 2)
- Total = 3 + 2 = 5
- Average = 5/2 = 2.5. Doesn't meet the >2.5 threshold.

Wait, but the problem says ""average 'Assessment' for that session name is greater than 2.5"". So sessions with average exactly 2.5 are excluded. 

So sessions that qualify are:
- ""III-Sepsis"" (average 3.0)
- ""IV-Hypoglycemia"" (average 3.0)

Now, count the respondents in these sessions.

""III-Sepsis"" has 1 respondent (Respondent3).
""IV-Hypoglycemia"" has 1 respondent (Respondent14).

Total respondents = 1 + 1 = 2.

Wait, but let me double-check. Are there any other sessions I missed?

Looking back:

- ""IV (VT)"" average 2.5 → no
- ""III-Sepsis"" → 3.0 → yes
- ""III - Sepsis"" → 2.0 → no
- ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"" → 2.0 → no
- ""IV-Hypoglycemia"" → 3.0 → yes
- ""I - MI"" → 2.5 → no

So only two sessions meet the average >2.5, each with one respondent. So total respondents is 2.

But wait, let me check the data again to make sure I didn't miss any other sessions.

Respondent3: III-Sepsis (3)
Respondent14: IV-Hypoglycemia (3)
Any others?

No, the rest have averages at 2.5 or below. So the answer should be 2.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents whose comments contain 'Good' also have a total score across all rubric items that is below the average total score for all sessions?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking for the number of respondents whose comments include the word 'Good' and also have a total score across all rubric items that's below the average total score for all sessions. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The responses are given for each respondent, each with various scores on different rubric items. The comments are open-ended, so I need to check if 'Good' is present in any of them. Then, calculate each respondent's total score, find the average total score across all sessions, and see which respondents with 'Good' in their comments have totals below that average.

Let me start by listing all respondents and their comments. Let's go through each one:

- Respondent7: Comments mention ""Time: (1:00-1:17)"" – no 'Good' here.
- Respondent17: Comments are ""Concise - clear Satisfactory"" – 'Satisfactory' but not 'Good'.
- Respondent4: Comments include ""Clinical handover... Satisfactory"" – again, 'Satisfactory' but no 'Good'.
- Respondent12: Comments are ""Good"" – that's a hit. So this respondent has 'Good' in comments.
- Respondent14: Comments mention time and consultation – no 'Good'.
- Respondent21: Comments say ""Diagnostic clarity... Good and early..."" – here, 'Good' is present.
- Respondent10: Comments are about time – no 'Good'.
- Respondent16: Comments mention consent denial and 'Satisfactory' – no 'Good'.
- Respondent9: Comments say ""Overall a bit unclear..."" – no 'Good'.
- Respondent11: Comments are ""Clear communication..."" – no 'Good'.

So, respondents 12 and 21 have 'Good' in their comments. Now, I need to calculate their total scores and compare them to the average.

Next, calculate each respondent's total score. The rubric items are Identification, Situation, Background_history, Background_examination, Assessment, Recommendation_clear_recommendation, and Recommendation_global_rating_scale. Each is scored 0-3. Let's sum these for each respondent.

Starting with all respondents:

Respondent7:
3 (Identification) + 3 (Situation) + 2 (Background_history) + 3 (Background_examination) + 2 (Assessment) + 2 (Recommendation_clear) + 2 (GRS) = 3+3+2+3+2+2+2 = 17

Respondent17:
3+3+3+3+3+3+2 = 20

Respondent4:
3+3+3+2+2+2+2 = 17

Respondent12:
3+3+3+3+2+3+3 = 20

Respondent14:
3+3+2+2+3+1+2 = 16

Respondent21:
3+2+3+1+2+3+3 = 17

Respondent10:
2+2+2+2+2+2+2 = 14

Respondent16:
3+3+3+3+3+2+3 = 20

Respondent9:
3+3+2+2+2+3+2 = 17

Respondent11:
3+3+3+3+3+3+3 = 21

Now, list all total scores:
17, 20, 17, 20, 16, 17, 14, 20, 17, 21.

To find the average total score, sum all these and divide by the number of respondents (10).

Sum = 17+20+17+20+16+17+14+20+17+21 = let's calculate:

17+20=37; 37+17=54; 54+20=74; 74+16=90; 90+17=107; 107+14=121; 121+20=141; 141+17=158; 158+21=179.

Total sum is 179. Average is 179 / 10 = 17.9.

Now, check the respondents with 'Good' in comments: 12 and 21.

Respondent12's total is 20, which is above 17.9. So that's not below average.

Respondent21's total is 17, which is below 17.9. 

Wait, 17 is less than 17.9, so that's one respondent. 

Wait, but wait: Respondent12's total is 20, which is above, so only Respondent21 qualifies. But earlier, I thought Respondent12 had 'Good' in comments. Let me confirm:

Respondent12's comments: ""Good"" – yes. But their total is 20, which is above average. So they don't count. Respondent21's comments include 'Good' and their total is 17, which is below 17.9. So only one respondent meets both criteria. 

But wait, let me check again. Are there any other respondents with 'Good' in comments? Respondent12 and 21. 

So the answer should be 1. But wait, let me check the totals again.

Wait, Respondent21's total: 3 (Identification) + 2 (Situation) +3 (Background_history) +1 (Background_exam) +2 (Assessment) +3 (Recommendation_clear) +3 (GRS) = 3+2=5, +3=8, +1=9, +2=11, +3=14, +3=17. Yes, 17. 

Average is 17.9. So 17 is below average. 

So only Respondent21. But wait, what about Respondent12? Their total is 20, which is above. So only one respondent. 

But wait, the answer in the example was 2. Wait, no, the example was a different question. The current task is different. So according to this calculation, the answer is 1. But let me check again.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the average. Let me re-calculate the total sum:

Respondent7:17

17:20

4:17

12:20

14:16

21:17

10:14

16:20

9:17

11:21

Adding these up:

17 + 20 = 37

37 +17=54

54+20=74

74+16=90

90+17=107

107+14=121

121+20=141

141+17=158

158+21=179. Yes, sum is 179. 179 divided by 10 is 17.9.

So average is 17.9.

Now, respondents with 'Good' in comments: 12 and 21.

Respondent12's total:20 (above 17.9) – doesn't count.

Respondent21's total:17 (below 17.9) – counts.

So total of 1. But wait, let me check if there are any other respondents with 'Good' in comments. 

Looking back:

Respondent12: ""Good"" – yes.

Respondent21: ""Good and early assessment..."" – yes.

Any others? Respondent11's comment is ""Clear communication and handover"" – no 'Good'. Respondent17: ""Concise - clear Satisfactory"" – no. Respondent4: ""Satisfactory"". So only 12 and 21.

So, of these two, only 21 has a total below average. So the answer is 1. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the total for Respondent21. Let me check again:

Identification:3

Situation:2

Background_history:3

Background_examination:1

Assessment:2

Recommendation_clear:3

GRS:3

Total: 3+2=5, +3=8, +1=9, +2=11, +3=14, +3=17. Correct.

So yes, 17. So 17 is below 17.9. So 1 respondent. But the example answer was 2 for a different question. But here, according to this, the answer is 1. But maybe I missed someone. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I missed another respondent with 'Good' in comments. Let me check all comments again:

Respondent12: ""Good"" – yes.

Respondent21: ""Good and early..."" – yes.

Any others? Respondent16: ""Satisfactory"" – no. Respondent9: ""unclear communication"" – no. Respondent11: ""Clear communication"" – no. So only two respondents with 'Good' in comments. 

Of those two, only Respondent21 has a total below average. So the answer is 1. But wait, maybe I miscalculated the average. Let me check again:

Total sum is 179. 179 divided by 10 is 17.9. Correct.

So the answer should be 1. But wait, maybe the average is calculated as the mean of all sessions, including those without 'Good' in comments. Yes, that's correct. So the average is 17.9. So any respondent with 'Good' in comments and total <17.9 is counted. Only Respondent21. So the answer is 1. But let me check if there's any other respondent with 'Good' in comments and total below 17.9.

Respondent12's total is 20, which is above. Respondent21's is 17, which is below. So only one. Therefore, the answer is 1.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who participated in a session where the average 'Situation' for that session name is greater than 2.0.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents who participated in a session where the average 'Situation' score for that session name is greater than 2.0. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The responses include various sessions with different names, and each respondent has a 'Situation' score. The 'Situation' question's rubric ranges from 0 to 3, so the scores can be 0, 1, 2, or 3. 

The key steps here are:
1. Group all respondents by their session name.
2. For each session group, calculate the average 'Situation' score.
3. Identify which session names have an average greater than 2.0.
4. Count all respondents in those sessions.

Let me start by listing all the respondents and their session names along with their 'Situation' scores.

Looking at the data:

- Respondent2: SessionName ""MI"", Situation ""3""
- Respondent8: ""III (Sepsis)"", Situation ""3""
- Respondent13: ""I-VF"", Situation ""3""
- Respondent20: ""IV (VT)"", Situation ""3""
- Respondent23: ""II-Anaphylaxsis"", Situation ""3""
- Respondent1: ""V (Hypoglycemia)"", Situation ""2""
- Respondent7: ""III-Sepsis"", Situation ""3""
- Respondent10: ""(MI)-VT"", Situation ""2""
- Respondent4: ""III (Sepsis)"", Situation ""3""
- Respondent21: ""I (Myocardial infarction)"", Situation ""2""

Now, group by session name:

1. MI: Respondent2 (Situation 3)
2. III (Sepsis): Respondent8 (3), Respondent4 (3)
3. I-VF: Respondent13 (3)
4. IV (VT): Respondent20 (3)
5. II-Anaphylaxsis: Respondent23 (3)
6. V (Hypoglycemia): Respondent1 (2)
7. III-Sepsis: Respondent7 (3)
8. (MI)-VT: Respondent10 (2)
9. I (Myocardial infarction): Respondent21 (2)

Wait, but some session names might be the same but written differently. For example, ""III (Sepsis)"" and ""III-Sepsis"" – are these considered the same session? The session names are as written, so ""III (Sepsis)"" and ""III-Sepsis"" are different. Similarly, ""MI"" and ""I (Myocardial infarction)"" might refer to the same condition but are different session names here. The problem states to group by the session name as given. So each unique session name is a separate group.

Now, calculate the average for each session:

1. MI: 3 (only 1 respondent) → average 3.0
2. III (Sepsis): 3 and 3 → average 3.0
3. I-VF: 3 → 3.0
4. IV (VT): 3 → 3.0
5. II-Anaphylaxsis: 3 → 3.0
6. V (Hypoglycemia): 2 → 2.0
7. III-Sepsis: 3 → 3.0
8. (MI)-VT: 2 → 2.0
9. I (Myocardial infarction): 2 → 2.0

Now, check which sessions have an average >2.0. All sessions except ""V (Hypoglycemia)"", ""(MI)-VT"", and ""I (Myocardial infarction)"" have averages of 3.0, which is greater than 2.0. The sessions with average 2.0 or below are those three. 

So the qualifying sessions are: MI, III (Sepsis), I-VF, IV (VT), II-Anaphylaxsis, III-Sepsis.

Now, count the respondents in these sessions:

- MI: 1 (Respondent2)
- III (Sepsis): 2 (Respondent8, Respondent4)
- I-VF: 1 (Respondent13)
- IV (VT): 1 (Respondent20)
- II-Anaphylaxsis: 1 (Respondent23)
- III-Sepsis: 1 (Respondent7)

Total respondents: 1+2+1+1+1+1 = 7.

Wait, but let me double-check the session names and their respondents again to ensure I didn't miss any.

Looking back:

- III (Sepsis): Respondents8 and 4 (2 people)
- III-Sepsis: Respondent7 (1 person)
So those are two separate sessions. So the total is correct.

Therefore, the answer should be 7 respondents.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents have a 'Identification' score that is higher than the average 'Identification' for all sessions on the same date?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking how many respondents have an 'Identification' score higher than the average 'Identification' score for all sessions on the same date. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The responses are individual respondents with various attributes, including the date of the session and their 'Identification' score. The task is to compare each respondent's 'Identification' score to the average of all respondents who share the same session date.

So, the plan is:

1. **Group respondents by date**: For each date, calculate the average 'Identification' score.
2. **Compare each respondent's score**: For each respondent, check if their 'Identification' score is higher than the average of their group (same date).
3. **Count the number of such respondents**: Tally up how many meet this condition.

Let's start by listing all the respondents with their dates and Identification scores:

- **Respondent9**: Date 2025-05-04, Identification 3
- **Respondent10**: Date 2025-03-14, Identification 2
- **Respondent11**: Date 2025-04-04, Identification 3
- **Respondent4**: Date 2025-05-16, Identification 3
- **Respondent1**: Date 2025-05-02, Identification -1
- **Respondent16**: Date 2025-05-02, Identification 3
- **Respondent14**: Date 2025-03-14, Identification 3
- **Respondent6**: Date 2025-04-04, Identification 3
- **Respondent3**: Date 2025-04-04, Identification 0

Now, group them by date:

**2025-03-14**:
- Respondent10: 2
- Respondent14: 3
Average = (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5

**2025-04-04**:
- Respondent11: 3
- Respondent6: 3
- Respondent3: 0
Average = (3 + 3 + 0)/3 = 2

**2025-05-02**:
- Respondent1: -1
- Respondent16: 3
Average = (-1 + 3)/2 = 1

**2025-05-04**:
- Respondent9: 3
Average = 3 (only one respondent)

**2025-05-16**:
- Respondent4: 3
Average = 3 (only one respondent)

Next, compare each respondent's score to their date's average:

- **Respondent9 (3 vs 3)**: Not higher. Equal, so no.
- **Respondent10 (2 vs 2.5)**: 2 < 2.5 → No.
- **Respondent11 (3 vs 2)**: 3 > 2 → Yes.
- **Respondent4 (3 vs 3)**: Equal → No.
- **Respondent1 (-1 vs 1)**: -1 < 1 → No.
- **Respondent16 (3 vs 1)**: 3 > 1 → Yes.
- **Respondent14 (3 vs 2.5)**: 3 > 2.5 → Yes.
- **Respondent6 (3 vs 2)**: 3 > 2 → Yes.
- **Respondent3 (0 vs 2)**: 0 < 2 → No.

Now count the ""Yes"" cases: Respondent11, Respondent16, Respondent14, Respondent6. That's 4 respondents.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations. For 2025-04-04, the average is (3+3+0)/3 = 2. So Respondent11 and 6 have 3, which is higher than 2. Respondent3 has 0, which is lower. So two in this group.

2025-03-14: average 2.5. Respondent10 has 2 (lower), Respondent14 has 3 (higher). So one here.

2025-05-02: average 1. Respondent1 has -1 (lower), Respondent16 has 3 (higher). One here.

Others: 2025-05-04 and 2025-05-16 have averages equal to the respondent's score, so no.

So total is 2 (from 04-04) + 1 (03-14) +1 (05-02) = 4. But wait, the example answer was 2. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, the example given in the first part had an answer of 2 for a similar question, but that was a different question. Let me make sure I'm not confusing the tasks. The current task is about 'Identification' scores higher than the average on the same date.

Wait, let's recount:

Respondent11 (3 > 2) → Yes.

Respondent6 (3 > 2) → Yes.

Respondent14 (3 > 2.5) → Yes.

Respondent16 (3 > 1) → Yes.

That's four. But maybe I made a mistake in the grouping. Let me check each date again.

2025-03-14: Respondents 10 and 14. Scores 2 and 3. Average (2+3)/2=2.5. So 3 is higher than 2.5 → Respondent14 counts.

2025-04-04: Respondents 11,6,3. Scores 3,3,0. Average 6/3=2. So 3 and 3 are higher → Respondents 11 and 6 count.

2025-05-02: Respondents 1 and 16. Scores -1 and 3. Average (2)/2=1. 3 is higher → Respondent16 counts.

Others: 2025-05-04 (3 vs 3 → no), 2025-05-16 (3 vs 3 → no).

So total of 1 (14) + 2 (11,6) +1 (16) = 4. But the example answer was 2. Wait, but the example was a different question. The user's current task is different. So perhaps the correct answer here is 4. But maybe I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, let me check the data again:

Looking at the data provided in the questionnaire section:

Respondent14: Date 2025-03-14, Identification 3. The average for that date is 2.5. So 3 is higher. So counts.

Respondent11: 2025-04-04, 3. Average 2. So counts.

Respondent6: same date as 11, 3. Counts.

Respondent16: 2025-05-02, 3. Average 1. Counts.

So that's 4. But maybe the data in the example is different? Wait, the example given in the first part had an answer of 2, but that was for a different question (number of respondents in 'I - MI' session). The current task is different. So perhaps the answer here is 4. But let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the average calculation for 2025-05-02. The respondents are Respondent1 and Respondent16. Their scores are -1 and 3. Sum is 2, divided by 2 is 1. So average is 1. So Respondent16's 3 is higher. Correct.

So total of 4. But maybe the answer is 4. However, the user's example answer was 2, but that was for a different question. So perhaps the answer here is 4. But I need to make sure.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the data. Let me recheck all respondents:

List of all respondents and their dates and Identification scores:

- Respondent9: 2025-05-04, 3
- Respondent10: 2025-03-14, 2
- Respondent11: 2025-04-04, 3
- Respondent4: 2025-05-16, 3
- Respondent1: 2025-05-02, -1
- Respondent16: 2025-05-02, 3
- Respondent14: 2025-03-14, 3
- Respondent6: 2025-04-04, 3
- Respondent3: 2025-04-04, 0

Grouping by date:

2025-03-14: Respondents 10 (2) and 14 (3) → average 2.5. So Respondent14's 3 is higher.

2025-04-04: Respondents 11 (3), 6 (3), 3 (0) → sum 6, average 2. So 3s are higher.

2025-05-02: Respondents 1 (-1) and 16 (3) → average 1. 3 is higher.

2025-05-04: Respondent9 (3) → average 3. Equal, so no.

2025-05-16: Respondent4 (3) → average 3. Equal, so no.

So total of 1 (Respondent14) + 2 (Respondents11 and 6) +1 (Respondent16) = 4.

But the example answer in the user's example was 2, but that was for a different question. So perhaps the correct answer here is 4. However, maybe I made a mistake in the data. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps the Identification scores are stored as strings, but in the data, they are given as numbers. For example, Respondent1 has ""-1"", which is a valid number. So all scores are integers. So calculations are correct.

Therefore, the answer should be 4. But the user's example had an answer of 2, but that was for a different question. So unless there's a mistake in my calculation, the answer is 4. But maybe I missed something. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps the average is rounded differently. For example, in 2025-03-14, average is 2.5. If the system uses integer division, but in the data, the average is 2.5. So 3 is higher than 2.5. So yes. So the count is correct.

Therefore, the final answer is 4.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents have a 'Background (examination)' score that is higher than the average 'Background (examination)' for all sessions on the same date?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking how many respondents have a 'Background (examination)' score higher than the average 'Background (examination)' score for all sessions on the same date. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The 'Background_examination' is a rubric-based score from 0 to 3. Each respondent has a date and a score for this category. 

The plan is to:
1. Group all respondents by their date.
2. For each date, calculate the average 'Background_examination' score.
3. Compare each respondent's score to the average of their respective date group.
4. Count how many respondents have a score higher than their group's average.

Let's start by listing all the respondents with their dates and Background_examination scores:

- Respondent18: 2025-05-04, score 2
- Respondent8: 2025-05-02, score 2
- Respondent17: 2025-05-04, score 3
- Respondent23: 2025-03-14, score 2
- Respondent12: 2025-05-02, score 3
- Respondent3: 2025-04-04, score 3
- Respondent13: 2025-03-14, score 1
- Respondent2: 2025-04-04, score 3
- Respondent7: 2025-03-14, score 3
- Respondent1: 2025-05-02, score 2
- Respondent22: 2025-05-16, score 3

Now, group them by date:

2025-03-14:
- Respondent23: 2
- Respondent13: 1
- Respondent7: 3
Average = (2 + 1 + 3) / 3 = 6/3 = 2

2025-04-04:
- Respondent3: 3
- Respondent2: 3
Average = (3 + 3)/2 = 3

2025-05-02:
- Respondent8: 2
- Respondent12: 3
- Respondent1: 2
Average = (2 + 3 + 2)/3 = 7/3 ≈ 2.333...

2025-05-04:
- Respondent18: 2
- Respondent17: 3
Average = (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5

2025-05-16:
- Respondent22: 3
Average = 3 (since only one respondent)

Now, check each respondent against their date's average:

2025-03-14 (avg 2):
- Respondent23: 2 → not higher
- Respondent13: 1 → lower
- Respondent7: 3 → higher (3 > 2)
Count: 1

2025-04-04 (avg 3):
- Respondent3: 3 → equal, not higher
- Respondent2: 3 → equal, not higher
Count: 0

2025-05-02 (avg ~2.333):
- Respondent8: 2 → lower
- Respondent12: 3 → higher (3 > 2.333)
- Respondent1: 2 → lower
Count: 1

2025-05-04 (avg 2.5):
- Respondent18: 2 → lower
- Respondent17: 3 → higher (3 > 2.5)
Count: 1

2025-05-16 (avg 3):
- Respondent22: 3 → equal, not higher
Count: 0

Adding them up: 1 (03-14) + 0 (04-04) + 1 (05-02) + 1 (05-04) + 0 (05-16) = 3 respondents.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations. 

For 2025-05-02, the average is 7/3 ≈ 2.333. Respondent12 has a 3, which is higher. So that's correct. 

2025-05-04: average 2.5. Respondent17 has 3, which is higher. 

2025-03-14: Respondent7 has 3, which is higher than 2. 

So total of 3 respondents. But wait, the example answer given in the initial example was 2. But in this case, according to the data here, the answer should be 3. However, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again.

Wait, the data provided in the questionnaire might be different. Let me check the actual data again.

Looking back at the responses:

Wait, in the current questionnaire, the data is the same as the example. Let me confirm each respondent's date and score:

- Respondent7: 2025-03-14, score 3
- Respondent23: 2025-03-14, score 2
- Respondent13: 2025-03-14, score 1
So their average is (3+2+1)/3 = 6/3=2. So Respondent7's 3 is higher than 2. Correct.

2025-05-02: Respondents 8 (2), 12 (3), 1 (2). Average (2+3+2)/3=7/3≈2.333. Respondent12's 3 is higher.

2025-05-04: Respondents 18 (2), 17 (3). Average 2.5. Respondent17's 3 is higher.

So that's three respondents: Respondent7, Respondent12, Respondent17. So the answer should be 3. But the example answer was 2. Wait, but the example question was different. The example was about 'I - MI' session, which had answer 2. The current task is different. So perhaps in this case, the correct answer is 3. But let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the grouping. Let me list all respondents again with their dates and scores:

Respondent18: 2025-05-04, 2
Respondent8: 2025-05-02, 2
Respondent17: 2025-05-04, 3
Respondent23: 2025-03-14, 2
Respondent12: 2025-05-02, 3
Respondent3: 2025-04-04, 3
Respondent13: 2025-03-14, 1
Respondent2: 2025-04-04, 3
Respondent7: 2025-03-14, 3
Respondent1: 2025-05-02, 2
Respondent22: 2025-05-16, 3

Grouping by date:

2025-03-14: 3 respondents (23,13,7) scores 2,1,3 → avg 2
2025-04-04: 2 respondents (3,2) scores 3,3 → avg 3
2025-05-02: 3 respondents (8,12,1) scores 2,3,2 → avg 7/3 ≈2.333
2025-05-04: 2 respondents (18,17) scores 2,3 → avg 2.5
2025-05-16: 1 respondent (22) score 3 → avg 3

Now, for each respondent:

- Respondent23 (2025-03-14, 2): 2 vs avg 2 → not higher
- Respondent13 (2025-03-14, 1): 1 < 2 → no
- Respondent7 (2025-03-14, 3): 3 > 2 → yes (count 1)
- Respondent3 (2025-04-04, 3): 3 vs 3 → no
- Respondent2 (2025-04-04, 3): 3 vs 3 → no
- Respondent8 (2025-05-02, 2): 2 < 2.333 → no
- Respondent12 (2025-05-02, 3): 3 > 2.333 → yes (count 2)
- Respondent1 (2025-05-02, 2): 2 < 2.333 → no
- Respondent18 (2025-05-04, 2): 2 < 2.5 → no
- Respondent17 (2025-05-04, 3): 3 > 2.5 → yes (count 3)
- Respondent22 (2025-05-16, 3): 3 vs 3 → no

Total of 3 respondents. But the example answer was 2. However, the example was a different question. So in this case, the correct answer should be 3. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again.

Wait, the average for 2025-05-02 is (2+3+2)/3 = 7/3 ≈2.333. So 3 is higher than 2.333, so Respondent12 counts. For 2025-05-04, 3 is higher than 2.5, so Respondent17 counts. And Respondent7 counts. So total 3. 

But the example answer was 2, but that was for a different question. So in this case, the answer should be 3. However, perhaps I made a mistake in the data. Let me check the data again.

Looking at the data provided in the questionnaire:

:Respondent7 a :Person ;
    pred:Date ""2025-03-14"" ;
    pred:SessionName ""III-Sepsis"" ;
    pred:Identification ""3"" ;
    pred:Situation ""3"" ;
    pred:Background_history ""2"" ;
    pred:Background_examination ""3"" ;
    pred:Assessment ""2"" ;
    pred:Recommendation_clear_recommendation ""2"" ;
    pred:Recommendation_global_rating_scale ""2"" ;
    pred:Comments ""Time: (1:00-1:17)""  .

Yes, Background_examination is 3. So Respondent7's score is 3 on 2025-03-14. The average for that date is 2. So yes, higher. 

Respondent12: 2025-05-02, score 3. Average for that date is 2.333. So higher.

Respondent17: 2025-05-04, score 3. Average 2.5. Higher.

So three respondents. Therefore, the answer should be 3. But why does the example answer have 2? Because the example was a different question. So in this case, the answer is 3. But I need to make sure I didn't miss any other respondents.

Wait, let me check all respondents again:

- Respondent18: 2 (05-04) → avg 2.5 → 2 < 2.5 → no
- Respondent8: 2 (05-02) → avg 2.333 → 2 < 2.333 → no
- Respondent17: 3 (05-04) → yes
- Respondent23: 2 (03-14) → avg 2 → no
- Respondent12: 3 (05-02) → yes
- Respondent3: 3 (04-04) → avg 3 → no
- Respondent13: 1 (03-14) → no
- Respondent2: 3 (04-04) → avg 3 → no
- Respondent7: 3 (03-14) → yes
- Respondent1: 2 (05-02) → no
- Respondent22: 3 (05-16) → avg 3 → no

Total of 3. So the answer is 3. But maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check the averages again.

2025-03-14: 2 +1 +3 =6 → 6/3=2. Correct.

2025-05-02: 2+3+2=7 → 7/3≈2.333. Correct.

2025-05-04: 2+3=5 → 5/2=2.5. Correct.

So yes, three respondents. Therefore, the answer should be 3.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents whose comments contain 'Clear' also have a total score across all rubric items that is below the average total score for all sessions?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking how many respondents have comments containing the word 'Clear' and also have a total score across all rubric items below the average total score for all sessions. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The responses are given for each respondent, with various rubric scores and comments. The rubric items are Identification, Situation, Background_history, Background_examination, Assessment, Recommendation_clear_recommendation, and Recommendation_global_rating_scale. Each of these is scored from 0 to 3. 

The plan is to:
1. Calculate each respondent's total score by summing all their rubric scores.
2. Find the average total score across all respondents.
3. Identify respondents whose comments include the word 'Clear' (case-sensitive? The example shows ""Clear communication"" so probably case-sensitive as per data).
4. For those respondents, check if their total score is below the average.
5. Count how many meet both criteria.

Let's start by calculating each respondent's total score. 

Looking at the data:

- Respondent11: All 3s except Assessment and Recommendation_clear_recommendation which are 3. Wait, looking at the data:

Wait, Respondent11's scores:
Identification:3, Situation:3, Background_history:3, Background_examination:3, Assessment:3, Recommendation_clear_recommendation:3, GRS:3. So total is 3*7=21.

Respondent19: All 3s except Assessment is 2. So 3+3+3+3+2+3+3= 3*6 +2= 20.

Respondent14: Identification:3, Situation:3, Background_history:2, Background_examination:2, Assessment:3, Recommendation_clear_recommendation:1, GRS:2. Total: 3+3+2+2+3+1+2= 16.

Respondent22: 3+3+3+3+2+2+3= 3*5 +2+2= 15+4=19.

Respondent13: 3+3+2+1+2+2+2= 3+3=6, 2+1=3, 2+2+2=6; total 6+3+6=15.

Respondent21: 3 (Identification) +2 (Situation) +3 (Background_history) +1 (Background_examination) +2 (Assessment) +3 (Recommendation_clear) +3 (GRS). Total: 3+2=5, +3=8, +1=9, +2=11, +3=14, +3=17.

Respondent10: 2+2+2+2+2+2+2=14.

Respondent4: 3+3+3+2+2+2+2= 3*3=9, 2*4=8; total 17.

Now, list all totals:

Respondent11:21

Respondent19:20

Respondent14:16

Respondent22:19

Respondent13:15

Respondent21:17

Respondent10:14

Respondent4:17

Next, calculate the average total score. Sum all these totals and divide by 8 (number of respondents).

Sum: 21+20=41, +16=57, +19=76, +15=91, +17=108, +14=122, +17=139. Total sum is 139. Average is 139 /8 = 17.375.

So the average total score is 17.375. Any total below this (i.e., less than 17.375) would be 17 or lower.

Now, check which respondents have comments containing 'Clear'. Let's look at each respondent's Comments:

Respondent11: ""Clear communication and handover"" → contains 'Clear'.

Respondent19: Comments mention ""Clarity is a bit low..."" → 'Clarity' but not 'Clear'.

Respondent14: Comments don't mention 'Clear'.

Respondent22: ""Clear communication skills Good"" → 'Clear'.

Respondent13: No 'Clear' in comments.

Respondent21: ""Diagnostic clarity is present..."" → 'clarity' not 'Clear'.

Respondent10: No 'Clear'.

Respondent4: ""Clinical handover and communication skills, satisfactory..."" → No 'Clear'.

So respondents with 'Clear' in comments: Respondent11 and Respondent22.

Now check their total scores:

Respondent11: 21 → which is above 17.375, so doesn't qualify.

Respondent22: 19 → also above 17.375. Wait, 19 is higher than 17.375. So neither of them have total below average. Wait, but wait, maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, the average is 17.375. So scores below that are 17 and below. So 17.375 is the average. So 17 is below average? Let me confirm: 17.375 is the average. So 17 is 0.375 below, which is below. So any total ≤17 would be below average. So let's check again the respondents with 'Clear' in comments.

Wait, Respondent11's total is 21 (above), Respondent22's total is 19 (also above). So neither of them have a total below the average. But wait, maybe I missed other respondents with 'Clear' in comments?

Wait, let's check again all comments:

Respondent11: ""Clear communication and handover"" → yes.

Respondent19: ""Clarity is a bit low..."" → no.

Respondent14: ""Late response..."" → no.

Respondent22: ""Clear communication skills..."" → yes.

Respondent13: no.

Respondent21: no.

Respondent10: no.

Respondent4: no.

So only Respondent11 and Respondent22 have 'Clear' in comments. Both have totals 21 and 19, which are above 17.375. Therefore, their total scores are not below average. So the count would be zero?

But wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the total scores. Let me recheck.

Wait, let's recheck the totals:

Respondent11: 3+3+3+3+3+3+3 = 21. Correct.

Respondent19: 3+3+3+3+2+3+3 = 3*6=18 +2=20. Correct.

Respondent14: 3+3+2+2+3+1+2= 3+3=6, 2+2=4, 3+1=4, 2=2. Total 6+4=10+4=14+2=16. Correct.

Respondent22: 3+3+3+3+2+2+3= 3*4=12 +3=15 (wait, 3 for Identification, 3 Situation, 3 Background_history, 3 Background_examination, 2 Assessment, 2 Recommendation_clear, 3 GRS. So 3+3=6, +3=9, +3=12, +2=14, +2=16, +3=19. Correct.

Respondent13: 3+3+2+1+2+2+2= 3+3=6, 2+1=3, 2+2+2=6. Total 6+3+6=15. Correct.

Respondent21: 3 (Identification) +2 (Situation) +3 (Background_history) +1 (Background_examination) +2 (Assessment) +3 (Recommendation_clear) +3 (GRS). 3+2=5, +3=8, +1=9, +2=11, +3=14, +3=17. Correct.

Respondent10: 2+2+2+2+2+2+2=14. Correct.

Respondent4: 3+3+3+2+2+2+2= 3+3=6, +3=9, +2=11, +2=13, +2=15, +2=17. Correct.

Sum: 21+20+16+19+15+17+14+17= Let's add step by step:

21+20=41

41+16=57

57+19=76

76+15=91

91+17=108

108+14=122

122+17=139. Correct. Average 139/8=17.375.

So the average is 17.375. So any total score below that is less than 17.375, which would be 17 or lower (since 17 is 17.0, which is below 17.375). So scores of 17 are below average? Wait, 17.375 is the average. So 17 is 0.375 below, which is below average. So any total ≤17 would be considered below average.

Now, the respondents with 'Clear' in comments are 11 and 22. Their totals are 21 and 19, both above 17.375. So none of them have a total below average. Therefore, the answer would be 0.

But wait, let me check again if there are other respondents with 'Clear' in comments. Let me check all comments again:

Respondent11: ""Clear communication and handover"" → yes.

Respondent19: ""Clarity is a bit low..."" → 'Clarity' but not 'Clear'.

Respondent14: No.

Respondent22: ""Clear communication skills Good"" → yes.

Respondent13: No.

Respondent21: ""Diagnostic clarity is present..."" → 'clarity' not 'Clear'.

Respondent10: No.

Respondent4: No.

So only two respondents. Both have totals above average. Therefore, the count is zero. But wait, the example given in the problem had an answer of 2, but that was for a different question. So in this case, the answer would be 0.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering case sensitivity. The problem says ""comments contain 'Clear'"". The example in the data has ""Clear communication"" with a capital C. The comments for Respondent22 have ""Clear communication skills"" with a capital C. So case-sensitive. Are there any other instances where 'clear' is lowercase? Let's check:

Respondent21's comment: ""Diagnostic clarity is present..."" → 'clarity' not 'clear'.

Respondent4: ""Clinical handover and communication skills, satisfactory..."" → 'Clinical' starts with C, but not 'clear'.

So no other instances. So only two respondents with 'Clear' in comments, both with totals above average. So the answer is 0.

But wait, maybe I miscalculated the average. Let me check again:

Total sum is 139. 8 respondents. 139 divided by 8: 8*17=136, 139-136=3. So 17.375. Correct.

So the answer is 0. But let me check again if any of the respondents with 'Clear' have a total below 17.375. Respondent11:21 (no), Respondent22:19 (no). So yes, 0.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents whose comments contain 'Satisfactory' also have a total score across all rubric items that is below the average total score for all sessions?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking for the number of respondents whose comments include the word 'Satisfactory' and whose total scores across all rubric items are below the average total score for all sessions. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The data has respondents with various rubric scores and comments. Each respondent has several rubric-based scores (like Identification, Situation, Background_history, etc.), each scored from 0 to 3, except for some that might have -1, which I need to check if that's a valid value or an error. The comments are open-ended text fields.

The steps I need to follow are:

1. **Calculate the total score for each respondent.**
   - Sum all the rubric scores for each respondent. But first, check if any of the scores are non-numeric or if there are invalid values. For example, in the data, Respondent1 has a pred:Identification of ""-1"". The rubric for Identification goes from 0 to 3, so ""-1"" might be a data entry error. How should I handle that? The example given in the data shows that the answer was 2, which might have considered ""-1"" as 0 or invalid. But since the example answer didn't explain, I need to make an assumption here. Let's proceed by treating ""-1"" as 0, assuming it's a mistake and the minimum possible score is 0. Alternatively, maybe it's a valid code, but the schema doesn't mention it. The schema for Identification says the rubric is 0-3, so ""-1"" is invalid. So perhaps we should exclude those responses or treat them as 0. For this analysis, I'll convert any negative values to 0. Similarly, check other scores for validity.

2. **Calculate the average total score across all sessions.**
   - Sum all the valid rubric scores for all respondents and divide by the number of respondents. But again, need to handle any invalid scores.

3. **Identify respondents whose comments contain 'Satisfactory' (case-sensitive?).**
   - Check the 'Comments' field for each respondent. The output example in the data shows that the answer is case-sensitive, as in the example, the answer was 2, and looking at the data, Respondent16 has ""Satisfactory"" with a capital S, and Respondent1 also has ""Satisfactory"". So the search is case-sensitive. So we need to look for exact matches of the substring 'Satisfactory' in the comments.

4. **For those respondents, check if their total score is below the average.**
   - Compare each of their total scores to the average calculated in step 2.

5. **Count how many such respondents exist.**

Let's start by processing each respondent's data.

First, list all respondents and their scores:

Looking at the data:

- **Respondent1**:
  - Identification: ""-1"" → treat as 0
  - Situation: 2
  - Background_history: 2
  - Background_examination: 2
  - Assessment: 3
  - Recommendation_clear_recommendation: 2
  - Recommendation_global_rating_scale: 2
  Total: 0 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 2 = 13? Wait, wait. Wait, how many rubric items are there? Let's check the questions:

The rubric items are:

- Identification (0-3)
- Situation (0-3)
- Background_history (0-3)
- Background_examination (0-3)
- Assessment (0-3)
- Recommendation_clear_recommendation (0-3)
- Recommendation_global_rating_scale (0-3)

So each respondent has 7 rubric items. So each total is the sum of these 7 items. Let me confirm:

Yes, each response includes these 7 predicates. So for each respondent, sum these 7 scores.

But some have ""-1"" which is outside 0-3. Let's handle those.

For each respondent:

**Respondent1**:
- Identification: ""-1"" → 0
- Situation: 2
- Background_history: 2
- Background_examination: 2
- Assessment: 3
- Recommendation_clear_recommendation: 2
- Recommendation_global_rating_scale: 2
Total: 0+2+2+2+3+2+2 = 13

**Respondent11**:
All scores are 3 except for Identification (3), so 3*7=21

**Respondent6**:
Situation:2, Assessment:2, Recommendation_clear_recommendation:2. Others 3. So 3+2+3+3+2+2+3= 3+2=5, +3=8, +3=11, +2=13, +2=15, +3=18? Wait, let's compute again:

Identification:3, Situation:2, Background_history:3, Background_examination:3, Assessment:2, Recommendation_clear_recommendation:2, GRS:3. So 3+2=5, +3=8, +3=11, +2=13, +2=15, +3=18. Total 18.

**Respondent20**:
Background_examination: -1 → 0. Background_history:2. Others: Identification:3, Situation:3, Assessment:3, Recommendation_clear_recommendation:2, GRS:3. So 3+3+2+0+3+2+3= 3+3=6, +2=8, +0=8, +3=11, +2=13, +3=16. Total 16.

**Respondent15**:
Background_history:2, Background_examination:3, Assessment:2, Recommendation_clear_recommendation:2, GRS:2. Others: Identification:3, Situation:3. So 3+3+2+3+2+2+2= 3+3=6, +2=8, +3=11, +2=13, +2=15, +2=17. Total 17.

**Respondent12**:
Assessment:2, others 3. So 3*6=18 +2=20. Wait:

Identification:3, Situation:3, Background_history:3, Background_examination:3, Assessment:2, Recommendation_clear_recommendation:3, GRS:3. So 3+3+3+3+2+3+3= 3*6=18 +2=20. Total 20.

**Respondent3**:
Identification:0, Situation:2, others: Background_history:3, Background_examination:3, Assessment:3, Recommendation_clear_recommendation:3, GRS:3. So 0+2+3+3+3+3+3= 0+2=2, +3=5, +3=8, +3=11, +3=14, +3=17. Total 17.

**Respondent14**:
Recommendation_clear_recommendation:1, Background_history:2, Background_examination:2. Others: Identification:3, Situation:3, Assessment:3, GRS:2. So 3+3+2+2+3+1+2= 3+3=6, +2=8, +2=10, +3=13, +1=14, +2=16. Total 16.

**Respondent16**:
All 3 except Recommendation_clear_recommendation:2. So 3*6=18 +2=20. Total 20.

**Respondent2**:
Background_history:2, GRS:1. Others: Identification:3, Situation:3, Background_examination:3, Assessment:3, Recommendation_clear_recommendation:2. So 3+3+2+3+3+2+1= 3+3=6, +2=8, +3=11, +3=14, +2=16, +1=17. Total 17.

**Respondent4**:
Background_examination:2, Assessment:2, Recommendation_clear_recommendation:2, GRS:2. Others: Identification:3, Situation:3, Background_history:3. So 3+3+3+2+2+2+2= 3+3=6, +3=9, +2=11, +2=13, +2=15, +2=17. Total 17.

Now, let's list all totals:

- Respondent1: 13
- Respondent11: 21
- Respondent6: 18
- Respondent20: 16
- Respondent15: 17
- Respondent12: 20
- Respondent3: 17
- Respondent14: 16
- Respondent16: 20
- Respondent2: 17
- Respondent4: 17

Now, calculate the average total score across all sessions.

Sum all these totals:

13 +21=34; +18=52; +16=68; +17=85; +20=105; +17=122; +16=138; +20=158; +17=175; +17=192. Wait, let me recount:

Wait, the list of respondents and their totals:

1. 13
2. 21
3. 18
4. 16
5. 17
6. 20
7. 17
8. 16
9. 20
10. 17
11. 17

Wait, there are 11 respondents. Let me sum them again:

13 (R1) +21 (R11)=34

+18 (R6)=52

+16 (R20)=68

+17 (R15)=85

+20 (R12)=105

+17 (R3)=122

+16 (R14)=138

+20 (R16)=158

+17 (R2)=175

+17 (R4)=192

Wait, that's 11 respondents. So total sum is 192. Average is 192 / 11 ≈ 17.4545...

So the average total score is approximately 17.45.

Now, find respondents whose comments include 'Satisfactory'. Let's check each respondent's comments:

- **Respondent1**: Comments ""Satisfactory"" → contains 'Satisfactory'.
- **Respondent11**: ""Clear communication and handover"" → no.
- **Respondent6**: empty → no.
- **Respondent20**: ""Good"" → no.
- **Respondent15**: ""Detailed Response - clear communication"" → no. Wait, the comment is ""Detailed Response - clear communication"" → no 'Satisfactory'.
Wait, looking back at the data:

Wait, in the data provided, the comments for each respondent:

- Respondent1: ""Satisfactory""
- Respondent11: ""Clear communication and handover""
- Respondent6: """"
- Respondent20: ""Good""
- Respondent15: ""Detailed Response - clear communication""
- Respondent12: ""Good""
- Respondent3: ""The patient/simulation is not oriented in TPP. Clear communication between Reg and colleague during handover""
- Respondent14: ""Time: (2:36-2:53) Late response for considering consultation""
- Respondent16: ""Consent denied for video recordings Satisfactory"" → contains 'Satisfactory'.
- Respondent2: """"
- Respondent4: ""Clinical handover and communication skills, satisfactory No panic, no arrest team Satisfactory"" → contains 'satisfactory' but lowercase? Wait, the comment is written as ""satisfactory"" or ""Satisfactory""?

Looking at the data for Respondent4:

:Respondent4 a :Person ;
    ...
    pred:Comments ""Clinical handover and communication skills, satisfactory
No panic, no arrest team
Satisfactory""  .

So the comments have ""satisfactory"" (lowercase) and ""Satisfactory"" (capitalized). So both instances. So the comment includes 'Satisfactory' (with capital S) and 'satisfactory' (lowercase). The task says ""comments contain 'Satisfactory'"". If the match is case-sensitive, then only the capital S instances count. If case-insensitive, both would. But the example in the data shows that in the answer, the correct count was 2, which in the example data, the respondents with 'Satisfactory' in comments were Respondent1 and Respondent16. Let's check the current data.

In the current data:

- Respondent1: ""Satisfactory"" → yes.
- Respondent16: ""Consent denied for video recordings
Satisfactory"" → yes.
- Respondent4: ""Clinical handover ... satisfactory
No panic, no arrest team
Satisfactory"" → has ""satisfactory"" (lowercase) and ""Satisfactory"" (capital). So if case-sensitive, then the lowercase 'satisfactory' doesn't count, but the capital 'Satisfactory' does. So Respondent4's comment includes 'Satisfactory' once. So that's three respondents: R1, R16, R4.

Wait, but in the example given, the answer was 2. But in the current data, perhaps the answer is different. Let's check the current data again.

Wait, the current data is in the <questionnaire> section. Let me recheck:

Looking at the responses in the current task's data:

- Respondent1: Comments ""Satisfactory""
- Respondent16: Comments ""Consent denied for video recordings
Satisfactory""
- Respondent4: Comments ""Clinical handover and communication skills, satisfactory
No panic, no arrest team
Satisfactory""

So in Respondent4's comments, the first occurrence is lowercase 'satisfactory', the second is 'Satisfactory'. So if the task is looking for the exact substring 'Satisfactory' (case-sensitive), then Respondent4's comment does contain 'Satisfactory' once. So that's three respondents: R1, R16, R4.

But wait, in the example provided earlier, the answer was 2. But the example's data might have different respondents. Let's focus on the current data.

So in the current task's data, the respondents with 'Satisfactory' in their comments (case-sensitive) are:

- Respondent1: Yes
- Respondent16: Yes
- Respondent4: Yes (because the last line is ""Satisfactory"")

So three respondents. Now, check their total scores:

- Respondent1: 13 → which is below the average of ~17.45
- Respondent16: 20 → which is above the average
- Respondent4: 17 → which is slightly below 17.45? Wait, 17 is less than 17.45, so yes.

Wait, the average is approximately 17.45. So 17 is below that. So Respondent4's total is 17, which is below the average.

So the three respondents with 'Satisfactory' in comments are R1 (13), R16 (20), R4 (17). Of these, R1 and R4 have totals below the average. R16's total is 20, which is above.

So the count is 2.

Wait, but in the data, Respondent4's total is 17, which is below 17.45. So that's two respondents: R1 (13) and R4 (17). R16's 20 is above.

So the answer should be 2.

But let me double-check the calculations.

Total sum: 192 for 11 respondents. 192 / 11 = 17.4545...

So 17.45 is the average. Any total below that would be 17 or less. So:

- R1:13 → below
- R4:17 → 17 is less than 17.45 → yes
- R16:20 → above

So two respondents meet the criteria.

Therefore, the answer is 2.
