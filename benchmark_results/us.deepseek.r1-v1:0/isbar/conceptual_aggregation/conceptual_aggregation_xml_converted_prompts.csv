<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents participated in a 'IV - VT' session?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question. The task is to find out how many respondents participated in a session named 'IV - VT'. 

First, I need to look at the data provided in the XML. The key part here is the <responses> section where each <respondent> has an <answer> for the question ""SessionName"". 

I'll go through each respondent one by one and check their SessionName. The goal is to count how many have exactly 'IV - VT' as their session name.

Looking at respondent id=""22"": Their SessionName is ""IV (VT)"". That's different because of the parentheses instead of a hyphen. 

Next, respondent id=""18"": Their SessionName is ""IV - VT"". That's a match. So that's one respondent. 

Other respondents have different session names like ""V (Hypoglycemia)"", ""II - Anaphylaxsis"", etc. I don't see any other entries with ""IV - VT"". 

Wait, let me double-check. The respondent id=""10"" has ""(MI)-VT"", which is not the same. Respondent id=""22"" is ""IV (VT)"", which is close but uses parentheses. Only respondent 18 has ""IV - VT"". 

So the total count is 1.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents who scored 2 on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' also have 'Comments' that contain the word 'reflected'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking: How many respondents who scored 2 on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' also have 'Comments' that contain the word 'reflected'?

First, I need to understand the data structure. The XML data has a 'responses' section with multiple 'respondent' elements, each containing answers to various questions. The task involves two specific questions: 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and 'Comments'.

The steps I need to follow are:

1. **Identify all respondents who scored 2 on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)'.**  
   I'll go through each respondent's answers and check the value of the 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' question. If the answer is '2', note that respondent.

2. **Check if their 'Comments' field contains the word 'reflected'.**  
   For each respondent identified in step 1, look at their 'Comments' answer. Check if the text includes the word 'reflected' (case-insensitive, I assume, but the problem says to preserve capitalization, so maybe exact match? The example in the output rules shows case-sensitive, like 'Abnormal' from 'a', but the question here is about containing the word. The example given in the previous answer had a comment with ""unclear communication reflected"" which was counted. So maybe it's a substring match, case-insensitive. But the output rules say to preserve capitalization. Hmm. The task says ""contain the word 'reflected'"", so probably case-insensitive. But the data in the comments might have different cases. Let's check the data.

Looking at the data provided:

- Respondent id=""9"" has Comments: ""Overall a bit unclear communication reflected"" – here 'reflected' is lowercase.
- Are there others? Let's check all respondents with 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' = 2.

Now, let's list all respondents and their answers to these two questions.

First, list all respondents and their 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' score and 'Comments':

Looking at each respondent:

- **Respondent 9**:  
  Recommendation (clear recommendation): 3  
  Comments: ""Overall a bit unclear communication reflected""  
  So, not a 2, so skip.

- **Respondent 7**:  
  Recommendation: 2  
  Comments: ""Time: (1:00-1:17)""  
  Check for 'reflected' – no.

- **Respondent 4**:  
  Recommendation: 2  
  Comments: ""Clinical handover and communication skills, satisfactory...""  
  No 'reflected'.

- **Respondent 15**:  
  Recommendation: 2  
  Comments: ""Detailed Response - clear communication""  
  No 'reflected'.

- **Respondent 3**:  
  Recommendation: 3  
  Skip.

- **Respondent 22**:  
  Recommendation: 2  
  Comments: ""Clear communication skills Good""  
  No 'reflected'.

- **Respondent 1**:  
  Recommendation: 2  
  Comments: ""Satisfactory""  
  No.

- **Respondent 2**:  
  Recommendation: 2  
  Comments: (empty)  
  No.

- **Respondent 13**:  
  Recommendation: 2  
  Comments: Mentions ""Lack of communication between..."" but no 'reflected'.

- **Respondent 6**:  
  Recommendation: 2  
  Comments: (empty)  
  No.

- **Respondent 21**:  
  Recommendation: 3  
  Skip.

Wait, but in the data, the 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' scores:

Looking again:

- Respondent 9: 3  
- Respondent 7: 2  
- Respondent 4: 2  
- Respondent 15: 2  
- Respondent 3: 3  
- Respondent 22: 2  
- Respondent 1: 2  
- Respondent 2: 2  
- Respondent 13: 2  
- Respondent 6: 2  
- Respondent 21: 3  

So the respondents with 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' = 2 are: 7,4,15,22,1,2,13,6. That's 8 respondents.

Now, check their comments for the word 'reflected' (case-insensitive):

- Respondent 7: Comments: ""Time: (1:00-1:17)"" – no.
- Respondent 4: Comments: ""Clinical handover..."" – no.
- Respondent 15: ""Detailed Response..."" – no.
- Respondent 22: ""Clear communication..."" – no.
- Respondent 1: ""Satisfactory"" – no.
- Respondent 2: empty – no.
- Respondent 13: Comments mention ""Lack of communication..."" – no 'reflected'.
- Respondent 6: empty – no.

Wait, but the only comment with 'reflected' is respondent 9, but their recommendation score is 3, not 2. So none of the respondents with a score of 2 have 'reflected' in their comments. Therefore, the answer is 0.

But wait, let me double-check. Did I miss any?

Looking again at all comments for respondents with score 2:

- 7: No
- 4: No
- 15: No
- 22: No
- 1: No
- 2: No
- 13: No
- 6: No

Yes, none of them have 'reflected' in their comments. The only one with 'reflected' is respondent 9, but they scored 3. So the answer is 0.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Background (examination)' and 'Assessment' is greater than 5.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the number of respondents whose total score for 'Background (examination)' and 'Assessment' is greater than 5. 

First, I need to understand where to find these two scores in the data. The 'Background (examination)' question has an id of ""Background (examination)"", and the 'Assessment' question has the id ""Assessment"". Each respondent's answers to these questions are numerical values based on their rubrics.

Looking at the data provided, each respondent has an entry under their answers for these two questions. For example, respondent 19 has a 'Background (examination)' score of 3 and an 'Assessment' score of 2. Adding those gives 5, which is not greater than 5, so they wouldn't be counted.

Next, I need to go through each respondent and calculate the sum of these two scores. Let's list them out:

- Respondent 19: Background (examination) = 3, Assessment = 2 → 3+2=5 → Not counted
- Respondent 7: Background (examination) = 3, Assessment = 2 → 3+2=5 → Not counted
- Respondent 3: Background (examination) = 3, Assessment = 3 → 3+3=6 → Counted
- Respondent 18: Background (examination) = 2, Assessment = 3 → 2+3=5 → Not counted
- Respondent 22: Background (examination) = 3, Assessment = 2 → 3+2=5 → Not counted
- Respondent 23: Background (examination) = 2, Assessment = 3 → 2+3=5 → Not counted
- Respondent 8: Background (examination) = 2, Assessment = 2 → 2+2=4 → Not counted

From this, only respondent 3 has a total score greater than 5. Therefore, the count is 1.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents from the 'II (Anaphylaxsis)' session scored 3 on 'Situation' and 2 on 'Assessment'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking how many respondents from the 'II (Anaphylaxsis)' session scored 3 on 'Situation' and 2 on 'Assessment'. 

First, I need to look through all the respondents in the data and check two things: their SessionName and their scores on Situation and Assessment. 

Starting with the SessionName. The target session is 'II (Anaphylaxsis)'. I notice that in the data, there are a few variations of Anaphylaxis sessions, like 'II - Anaphylaxsis', 'II (Anaphylaxsis)', 'II-Anaphylaxsis', and 'II (Anaphylactic Shock)'. The exact match we're looking for is 'II (Anaphylaxsis)', so I need to check which respondents have that exact SessionName.

Looking at the respondents:

- Respondent 5: SessionName is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" – close but has a hyphen instead of parentheses. Not an exact match.
- Respondent 9: SessionName is ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"" – this matches exactly.
- Respondent 23: SessionName is ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" – hyphen again, not exact.
- Respondent 6: SessionName is ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"" – different name.

So only respondent 9 is in the exact 'II (Anaphylaxsis)' session.

Now, check their scores. For respondent 9:
- Situation: 3
- Assessment: 2

That matches the criteria. 

Wait, but maybe I should check other respondents with similar session names just in case. For example, respondent 5 has ""II - Anaphylaxsis"". The question specifies 'II (Anaphylaxsis)', so the parentheses are important. The hyphen might be a typo, but according to the data, they are different entries. So only respondent 9 is in the exact session. 

Are there any other respondents with SessionName exactly 'II (Anaphylaxsis)'? Let me check again. The data shows respondent 9 as the only one. 

Therefore, the count is 1.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and 'Situation' is greater than 5.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the number of respondents whose total score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and 'Situation' is greater than 5. 

First, I need to understand the structure of the data provided. The data is in XML format, with a list of questions and responses. Each respondent has answers to various questions, including 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and 'Situation'. Both of these questions are scored on a rubric, with possible values from 0 to 3.

The goal is to sum the scores of these two questions for each respondent and check if the sum exceeds 5. Then, count how many respondents meet this criterion.

Let me start by looking at each respondent's answers to these two questions. I'll go through each respondent one by one.

First respondent: id=""5""
- 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' score: 2
- 'Situation' score: 3
Sum: 2 + 3 = 5. Since 5 is not greater than 5, this respondent doesn't count.

Second respondent: id=""1""
- 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' score: 2
- 'Situation' score: 2
Sum: 2 + 2 = 4. Doesn't meet the criteria.

Third respondent: id=""12""
- 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' score: 3
- 'Situation' score: 3
Sum: 3 + 3 = 6. This is greater than 5. Count this one.

Fourth respondent: id=""8""
- 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' score: 2
- 'Situation' score: 3
Sum: 2 + 3 = 5. Doesn't count.

Fifth respondent: id=""19""
- 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' score: 3
- 'Situation' score: 3
Sum: 3 + 3 = 6. This also meets the criteria. Count this one.

So, out of the five respondents, two (id 12 and 19) have a total score greater than 5. Therefore, the answer should be 2.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents from the 'II (Anaphylactic Shock)' session scored 3 on 'Background (examination)' and 2 on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking how many respondents from the 'II (Anaphylactic Shock)' session scored 3 on 'Background (examination)' and 2 on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)'. 

First, I need to look through all the respondents in the data provided. Each respondent has a SessionName, and various scores for different questions. 

Starting with the SessionName: I need to find all respondents where the SessionName is exactly 'II (Anaphylactic Shock)'. Let me check each respondent's SessionName.

Looking at respondent id=6, their SessionName is 'II (Anaphylactic Shock)', which matches. Are there any others? Let me check the others. Respondent id=9 has 'II (Anaphylaxsis)', which is similar but not exactly the same. Respondent id=5 has 'II - Anaphylaxsis', and id=12 has 'II (Anaphylaxis)'. The exact match is only id=6. 

Now, for respondent id=6, check their scores. The 'Background (examination)' score is 3, and 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' is 2. That meets both conditions. 

Are there any other respondents in the 'II (Anaphylactic Shock)' session? From the data, no. The other II sessions have slightly different names. So only respondent 6 fits both the session name and the score criteria. 

Therefore, the count should be 1.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

How many respondents who scored 2 on 'Background (examination)' also have 'Comments' that contain the word 'communication'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find out how many respondents scored 2 on 'Background (examination)' and also have 'Comments' that include the word 'communication'. 

First, I need to go through each respondent in the data and check two things: their score for 'Background (examination)' and whether their 'Comments' contain the word 'communication'. 

Starting with the respondents, let's look at each one:

1. **Respondent 15**: Background (examination) is 3. Comments mention ""clear communication"". Since the score is 3, not 2, this one doesn't count.

2. **Respondent 12**: Background (examination) is 3. Comments are ""Good"". Doesn't meet either condition.

3. **Respondent 17**: Background (examination) is 3. Comments mention ""Concise - clear"" and ""Satisfactory"". No 'communication' here. So no.

4. **Respondent 19**: Background (examination) is 3. Comments talk about CPR and clarity. Not matching.

5. **Respondent 4**: Background (examination) is 2. Comments include ""Clinical handover and communication skills, satisfactory"". This one has a score of 2 and 'communication' in comments. So count this.

6. **Respondent 23**: Background (examination) is 2. Comments mention summarizing the patient's condition but no 'communication' word. So no.

7. **Respondent 21**: Background (examination) is 1. Score is too low. Comments don't have 'communication'.

8. **Respondent 8**: Background (examination) is 2. Comments say ""Clear communication during handover"". So this one meets both criteria. Count this.

9. **Respondent 10**: Background (examination) is 2. Comments only have a time entry. No 'communication' here.

10. **Respondent 1**: Background (examination) is 2. Comments are ""Satisfactory"". Doesn't include 'communication'.

11. **Respondent 22**: Background (examination) is 3. Comments mention ""Clear communication skills"". But score is 3, so doesn't count.

So, after checking all respondents, the ones that meet both conditions are Respondent 4 and Respondent 8. That makes a total of 2 respondents.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

How many respondents who scored 3 on 'Background (examination)' also have 'Comments' that contain the word 'reflected'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find out how many respondents scored 3 on 'Background (examination)' and also have the word 'reflected' in their Comments. 

First, I need to look through all the respondents in the data. Each respondent has an answer for 'Background (examination)' and a 'Comments' section. 

Starting with respondent id=""10"": their Background (examination) score is 2, so they don't meet the first condition. Moving on to id=""15"", their score is 3. Now, check their Comments: ""Detailed Response - clear communication"". No 'reflected' here.

Next, id=""21"" has a Background (examination) score of 1. Skip. Respondent 1 has a score of 2. Respondent 2 has a score of 3. Their Comments are empty, so no match. 

Respondent 16 scored 3 in Background (examination). Their Comments mention ""Consent denied for video recordings"" and ""Satisfactory"". Still no 'reflected'. 

Respondent 13's score is 1. Respondent 14 has a score of 2. Respondent 11 has a score of 3. Their Comments say ""Clear communication and handover"". No 'reflected' here either. 

Respondent 19 scored 3 in Background (examination). Their Comments include ""Wrong CPR position"", ""Clarity is a bit low..."", and ""Satisfactory"". No mention of 'reflected'. 

Respondent 8 has a score of 2. Respondent 12's score is 3. Their Comments are just ""Good"". 

Looking through all the respondents who scored 3 in Background (examination): ids 15, 2, 16, 11, 19, 12. None of their Comments include the word 'reflected'. 

So the count is zero.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and 'Background (history)' is greater than 5.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the number of respondents whose total score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and 'Background (history)' is greater than 5. 

First, I need to locate the relevant data in the provided XML. The 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and 'Background (history)' are question IDs. For each respondent, I need to find their answers to these two questions, convert them to numerical values, sum them, and check if the sum exceeds 5.

Looking at the questions section, the 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' has a rubric from 0 to 3. Similarly, 'Background (history)' also uses a rubric from 0 to 3. The maximum possible sum for both is 6 (3+3), so any sum greater than 5 would mean the sum is exactly 6. Wait, no, the question says ""greater than 5,"" so sums of 6 would be the only ones that qualify. But let me confirm: if each can be up to 3, adding them gives a maximum of 6. So a total greater than 5 would be 6. But maybe the user wants the sum to be more than 5, which is 6. However, I should check each respondent's scores and sum them correctly.

Now, I need to go through each respondent in the responses section and check their scores for these two questions. Let's list them one by one.

Respondent 3:
- Background (history): 3
- Recommendation (clear recommendation): 3
Sum: 3 + 3 = 6 → which is greater than 5. So count this.

Respondent 23:
- Background (history): 2
- Recommendation (clear recommendation): 3
Sum: 2 + 3 = 5 → not greater than 5. Exclude.

Respondent 11:
- Background (history): 3
- Recommendation (clear recommendation): 3
Sum: 6 → include.

Respondent 20:
- Background (history): 2
- Recommendation (clear recommendation): 2
Sum: 4 → exclude.

Respondent 5:
- Background (history): 3
- Recommendation (clear recommendation): 2
Sum: 5 → exclude.

Respondent 22:
- Background (history): 3
- Recommendation (clear recommendation): 2
Sum: 5 → exclude.

Respondent 19:
- Background (history): 3
- Recommendation (clear recommendation): 3
Sum: 6 → include.

Respondent 9:
- Background (history): 2
- Recommendation (clear recommendation): 3
Sum: 5 → exclude.

Respondent 10:
- Background (history): 2
- Recommendation (clear recommendation): 2
Sum: 4 → exclude.

Respondent 21:
- Background (history): 3
- Recommendation (clear recommendation): 3
Sum: 6 → include.

Respondent 15:
- Background (history): 2
- Recommendation (clear recommendation): 2
Sum: 4 → exclude.

Now, let's count how many respondents have a sum greater than 5. 

Looking at the list:
- Respondent 3: 6 → yes
- Respondent 11: 6 → yes
- Respondent 19: 6 → yes
- Respondent 21: 6 → yes

Wait, that's four respondents. But let me double-check each entry to avoid mistakes.

Wait, respondent 3: 3+3=6 → yes.

Respondent 11: 3+3=6 → yes.

Respondent 19: 3+3=6 → yes.

Respondent 21: 3+3=6 → yes.

So that's four respondents. But wait, let me check again each one to make sure I didn't miss any.

Wait, in the data provided, the respondents are:

Looking back:

Respondent 3: 3 and 3 → sum 6.

Respondent 11: 3 and 3 → sum 6.

Respondent 19: 3 and 3 → sum 6.

Respondent 21: 3 and 3 → sum 6.

Yes, four respondents. But wait, in the original example, the answer was 2. But that was for a different question. The current task is different. So the answer here is 4?

Wait, let me check again each respondent's data.

Looking at the XML data:

Respondent 3:
<answer question=""Background (history)"">3</answer>
<answer question=""Recommendation (clear recommendation)"">3</answer>
Sum: 6.

Respondent 11:
<answer question=""Background (history)"">3</answer>
<answer question=""Recommendation (clear recommendation)"">3</answer>
Sum: 6.

Respondent 19:
<answer question=""Background (history)"">3</answer>
<answer question=""Recommendation (clear recommendation)"">3</answer>
Sum: 6.

Respondent 21:
<answer question=""Background (history)"">3</answer>
<answer question=""Recommendation (clear recommendation)"">3</answer>
Sum: 6.

Yes, four respondents. So the answer should be 4. But wait, let me check if there are any other respondents with sum >5.

Wait, any other respondents? Let's check all:

Respondent 23: 2 +3=5 → no.

Respondent 20: 2+2=4 → no.

Respondent 5:3+2=5 → no.

Respondent 22:3+2=5 → no.

Respondent 9:2+3=5 → no.

Respondent 10:2+2=4 → no.

Respondent 15:2+2=4 → no.

So only respondents 3, 11, 19, 21 have sum 6. Therefore, the count is 4.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents from the '(MI)-VT' session scored 2 on 'Assessment' and 2 on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find out how many respondents from the '(MI)-VT' session scored 2 on 'Assessment' and 2 on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)'. 

First, I need to look through all the respondents in the data provided. Each respondent has a 'SessionName' which tells us which session they participated in. The target session here is '(MI)-VT'. So, I need to filter out all respondents where the 'SessionName' is exactly '(MI)-VT'.

Looking at the responses section, I'll go through each respondent one by one. 

Starting with respondent id=""23"": Their SessionName is ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" – not a match. 

Respondent id=""11"": SessionName is ""IV (AF)"" – nope. 

Respondent id=""13"": ""I-VF"" – not matching. 

Respondent id=""20"": ""IV (VT)"" – no. 

Respondent id=""17"": ""V (Hypoglycemia)"" – skip. 

Respondent id=""10"": Here, the SessionName is ""(MI)-VT"". That's the one we need. 

Now, check their scores for 'Assessment' and 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)'. 

Looking at their answers: 
- Assessment: 2
- Recommendation (clear recommendation): 2 

Both match the required scores. 

Continuing to check other respondents to ensure there are no others. 

Respondent id=""15"": SessionName is ""III - Sepsis"" – no. 

Respondent id=""14"": ""IV-Hypoglycemia"" – not relevant. 

Respondent id=""2"": SessionName is ""MI"" – close but not exactly '(MI)-VT'. 

Respondent id=""21"": ""I (Myocardial infarction)"" – different session. 

Respondent id=""12"": ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" – nope. 

Respondent id=""19"": ""I - MI"" – not the same as '(MI)-VT'.

So, only respondent id=""10"" meets both the session name and the score criteria. Therefore, the count is 1.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents from the 'I-VF' session scored 2 on 'Assessment' and 3 on 'Situation'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find out how many respondents from the 'I-VF' session scored 2 on 'Assessment' and 3 on 'Situation'. 

First, I need to look through all the respondents in the data provided. Each respondent has a 'SessionName' which tells us which session they participated in. I need to filter out only those respondents where the 'SessionName' is exactly 'I-VF'. 

Looking at the responses section, I'll go through each respondent one by one. 

Starting with respondent id=""7"": SessionName is III-Sepsis. Not I-VF. Skip.

Respondent id=""14"": IV-Hypoglycemia. Not relevant.

Respondent id=""15"": III - Sepsis. Nope.

Respondent id=""8"": III (Sepsis). Still not.

Respondent id=""22"": IV (VT). No.

Respondent id=""11"": IV (AF). Not matching.

Respondent id=""21"": I (Myocardial infarction). Close, but the session name is different.

Respondent id=""13"": Here, the SessionName is I-VF. This matches the target session. Now, check their scores for 'Assessment' and 'Situation'. 

Looking at their answers: 
- Situation: 3
- Assessment: 2

So this respondent meets both criteria. 

Next, check if there are any other respondents with SessionName 'I-VF'. Going through the remaining respondents:

id=""23"": II-Anaphylaxsis. No.
id=""12"": II (Anaphylaxis). No.
id=""2"": MI. No.
id=""6"": II (Anaphylactic Shock). No.

Only respondent id=""13"" is in the 'I-VF' session. Their 'Assessment' is 2 and 'Situation' is 3. Therefore, the count is 1.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents who scored 2 on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' also have 'Comments' that contain the word 'unclear'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find out how many respondents scored 2 on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and also have 'Comments' that include the word 'unclear'. 

First, I need to look through all the respondents in the data. Each respondent has answers to various questions, including the 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 'Comments'. 

Starting with the 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' score. The question defines this as a rubric where 2 means ""Confident but required some further questioning"". So I need to filter all respondents who have a '2' in their answer for this question.

Next, for each of those respondents, I need to check their 'Comments' field to see if it contains the word 'unclear'. The search should be case-insensitive, but the exact presence of the substring 'unclear' is needed. 

Looking at the data:

- Respondent 9: Their 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is 2. The comment is ""Overall a bit unclear communication reflected"". This contains 'unclear'.
- Respondent 14: Their GRS is 2. The comment mentions ""Late response for considering consultation"" – no 'unclear' here.
- Respondent 15: GRS is 2. Comment is ""Detailed Response - clear communication"" – no 'unclear'.
- Any others? Let me check all respondents:

Looking through each respondent's entries:

- Respondent 11: GRS 3 – skip.
- Respondent 22: GRS 3 – skip.
- Respondent 9: As above, matches.
- Respondent 12: GRS 3 – skip.
- Respondent 5: GRS 3 – skip.
- Respondent 16: GRS 3 – skip.
- Respondent 3: GRS 3 – skip.
- Respondent 17: GRS 2. Comment: ""Concise - clear Satisfactory"" – no 'unclear'.
- Respondent 14: GRS 2, comment doesn't have 'unclear'.
- Respondent 2: GRS 1 – skip.
- Respondent 15: GRS 2, comment no 'unclear'.

So only respondent 9 has both a GRS of 2 and a comment with 'unclear'. Therefore, the count is 1.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents from the 'IV - VT' session scored 2 on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 3 on 'Situation'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find out how many respondents from the 'IV - VT' session scored 2 on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 3 on 'Situation'. 

First, I need to look through all the respondents in the data provided. Each respondent has a SessionName, and various scores for different questions. 

Starting with the SessionName: I need to filter out all respondents whose SessionName is exactly 'IV - VT'. Looking at the data, let's check each respondent's SessionName:

- Respondent 4: III (Sepsis)
- Respondent 12: II (Anaphylaxis)
- Respondent 5: II - Anaphylaxsis
- Respondent 18: IV - VT
- Respondent 2: MI
- Respondent 20: IV (VT)
- Respondent 11: IV (AF)
- Respondent 23: II-Anaphylaxsis
- Respondent 7: III-Sepsis
- Respondent 6: II (Anaphylactic Shock)
- Respondent 17: V (Hypoglycemia)

From this list, only respondent 18 has the SessionName ""IV - VT"". Now, I need to check their scores for 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 'Situation'.

Looking at respondent 18's answers:
- Situation: 3
- Recommendation (global rating scale): 2

So, this respondent meets both conditions. 

But wait, there's another respondent with a similar session name. Respondent 20 has SessionName ""IV (VT)"". The question specifically asks for 'IV - VT', which uses a hyphen and space. The parentheses in respondent 20's SessionName might be a different formatting, so according to the data, they are considered different sessions. Therefore, respondent 20 is part of ""IV (VT)"", not ""IV - VT"", so they shouldn't be counted here.

Therefore, only respondent 18 qualifies. The count is 1.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 'Assessment' is greater than 5.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the number of respondents whose total score for 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 'Assessment' is greater than 5. 

First, I need to understand which questions correspond to these two categories. Looking at the questions section, 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' has the id ""Recommendation (global rating scale)"" and uses a rubric from 0 to 3. Similarly, the 'Assessment' question has the id ""Assessment"" with a rubric from 0 to 3. 

Each respondent's answers to these two questions need to be summed, and we need to check if their total exceeds 5. Since both questions can each have a maximum of 3 points, the highest possible total is 6. So, a total greater than 5 would mean the sum is 6.

Now, I'll go through each respondent in the responses section and calculate their scores for these two questions.

Starting with respondent id=""2"":
- Recommendation (global rating scale): 1
- Assessment: 3
Total: 1 + 3 = 4 → Not greater than 5.

Respondent id=""10"":
- GRS: 2
- Assessment: 2
Total: 4 → No.

Respondent id=""20"":
- GRS: 3
- Assessment: 3
Total: 6 → Yes. Count this one.

Respondent id=""22"":
- GRS: 3
- Assessment: 2

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

How many respondents from the 'II (Anaphylaxis)' session scored 3 on 'Background (examination)' and 3 on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking how many respondents from the 'II (Anaphylaxis)' session scored 3 on both 'Background (examination)' and 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)'. 

First, I need to look through the responses in the provided XML data. Each respondent is listed under the <responses> section with their respective answers. The key here is to filter the respondents based on three criteria:

1. Their SessionName must be exactly 'II (Anaphylaxis)'.
2. Their score for 'Background (examination)' should be 3.
3. Their score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' should be 3.

Starting with the first criterion, I'll go through each respondent and check their SessionName. Let's look at each respondent one by one.

- Respondent 4: SessionName is ""III (Sepsis)"" – doesn't match.
- Respondent 12: SessionName is ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" – this matches. Now check their scores. Background (examination) is 3, and Recommendation (clear recommendation) is 3. So this one meets all criteria.
- Respondent 18: SessionName is ""IV - VT"" – no match.
- Respondent 22: SessionName is ""IV (VT)"" – no.
- Respondent 23: SessionName is ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" – note the spelling difference here. The question specifies ""II (Anaphylaxis)"", so even though it's similar, the exact name might matter. The spelling here is ""Anaphylaxsis"" which is a typo, but according to the data, it's a different session name. So this doesn't match.
- Respondent 9: SessionName is ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"" – again, the spelling is different. The original question uses ""Anaphylaxis"", so this might be a typo in the data, but we have to take the data as given. So this doesn't match.
- Respondent 8: SessionName is ""III (Sepsis)"" – no.
- Respondent 14: SessionName is ""IV-Hypoglycemia"" – no.
- Respondent 16: SessionName is ""I - MI"" – no.

So the only respondent that matches the SessionName exactly is respondent 12. Now checking their scores: Background (examination) is 3 and Recommendation (clear recommendation) is 3. That's exactly what we're looking for. 

Wait, but let me double-check respondent 23 and 9. Their SessionNames are ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" and ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"" respectively. The original question is about ""II (Anaphylaxis)"". The spelling difference here is ""Anaphylaxsis"" vs ""Anaphylaxis"". Since the data entries have different spellings, we can't assume they're the same unless specified. Therefore, these two respondents don't match the required session name. 

Therefore, only respondent 12 meets all the criteria. The count is 1.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

How many respondents who scored 3 on 'Background (examination)' also have 'Comments' that contain the word 'unclear'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking for the number of respondents who scored 3 on 'Background (examination)' and also have 'Comments' that include the word 'unclear'. 

First, I need to look through all the respondents in the data. Each respondent has answers to various questions, including 'Background (examination)' and 'Comments'. 

Starting with the 'Background (examination)' score: I need to find all respondents where the answer to this question is 3. Let me go through each respondent one by one.

Looking at respondent 20: Their 'Background (examination)' is -1, so that's not a 3. Respondent 23 has 2. Respondent 21 has 1. Respondent 18 has 2. Respondent 1 has 2. Respondent 9 has 2. Respondent 19 has 3. That's one. Respondent 6 has 3. Second one. Respondent 5 has 3. Third. Respondent 12 has 3. Fourth. Respondent 13 has 1. Respondent 15 has 3. Fifth. Wait, let me check again to make sure I didn't miss any.

Wait, respondent 6: Background (examination) is 3. Respondent 5: 3. Respondent 12: 3. Respondent 15: 3. So that's respondents 19, 6, 5, 12, 15. Wait, no. Wait, let me list them again:

- Respondent 19: 3
- Respondent 6: 3
- Respondent 5: 3
- Respondent 12: 3
- Respondent 15: 3

Wait, that's five respondents. But wait, looking back at the data:

Looking at each respondent's 'Background (examination)' answer:

- 20: -1
- 23: 2
- 21:1
- 18:2
- 1:2
- 9:2
- 19:3 ✅
- 6:3 ✅
- 5:3 ✅
- 12:3 ✅
- 13:1
- 15:3 ✅

So that's five respondents with a score of 3. Now, among these five, I need to check if their 'Comments' field contains the word 'unclear'.

Let's check each of them:

Respondent 19: Comments: ""Wrong CPR position Clarity is a bit low over whole case scenario Satisfactory"". The word 'unclear' isn't here, but 'Clarity is a bit low' might be similar. However, the exact word 'unclear' isn't present. So this one doesn't count.

Respondent 6: Comments are empty. So no.

Respondent 5: Comments: ""Good clear and precise clinical handover Good"". No 'unclear' here.

Respondent 12: Comments: ""Good"". No.

Respondent 15: Comments: ""Detailed Response - clear communication"". Also no 'unclear'.

Wait, but wait, maybe I missed someone. Let me check again.

Wait, are there any other respondents with 'Background (examination)' 3? Let me confirm:

Yes, the five are 19,6,5,12,15. Now checking their comments:

19: ""Clarity is a bit low"" – not 'unclear'.

6: No comments.

5: ""Good clear..."" – no.

12: ""Good"" – no.

15: ""clear communication"" – no.

Hmm, none of these have 'unclear' in their comments. But wait, maybe I missed a respondent. Let me check again.

Wait, looking back at the data, maybe I made a mistake in identifying the respondents with 'Background (examination)' 3. Let me recheck:

Looking at each respondent:

- 19: 3 ✅
- 6: 3 ✅
- 5: 3 ✅
- 12: 3 ✅
- 15: 3 ✅

Yes, five. Now their comments:

19: Comments include ""Clarity is a bit low"" – 'unclear' is not present.

Wait, but maybe 'unclear' is in another respondent's comments. Let me check all comments again for the word 'unclear' regardless of their 'Background (examination)' score.

Looking through all respondents:

Respondent 9: Comments: ""Overall a bit unclear communication reflected"" – here's 'unclear'. But what's their 'Background (examination)' score? Respondent 9's 'Background (examination)' is 2. So they scored 2, not 3. So they don't qualify.

Respondent 13: Comments mention ""Lack of communication between 2 main interns"" – no 'unclear'.

Respondent 18: Comments: ""Not very concise or clear communication"" – 'clear' but not 'unclear'.

Respondent 23: Comments: ""Talking to registrav could not summarize the condition of patient very clearly"" – 'clearly' but not 'unclear'.

Respondent 19: ""Clarity is a bit low"" – not 'unclear'.

So the only respondent with 'unclear' in comments is respondent 9, but their 'Background (examination)' is 2. Therefore, among those with 'Background (examination)' 3, none have 'unclear' in their comments. So the answer should be 0.

Wait, but wait, maybe I missed a respondent. Let me check again all comments for 'unclear':

Looking at each comment:

- 20: ""Good"" – no
- 23: ""Talking to registrav could not summarize the condition of patient very clearly DID: Sepsis I Anaphylaxsis given by team"" – no
- 21: ""Diagnostic clarity is present Good and early assessment of condition is done"" – no
- 18: ""Not very concise or clear communication Satisfactory"" – 'clear' but not 'unclear'
- 1: ""Satisfactory"" – no
- 9: ""Overall a bit unclear communication reflected"" – yes, 'unclear' here
- 19: ""Clarity is a bit low..."" – no
- 6: (no comment)
- 5: ""Good clear and precise..."" – no
- 12: ""Good"" – no
- 13: ""Lack of communication..."" – no
- 15: ""Detailed Response - clear communication"" – no

Only respondent 9 has 'unclear' in comments, but their 'Background (examination)' is 2. So none of the respondents with 'Background (examination)' 3 have 'unclear' in their comments. Therefore, the answer is 0.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who participated in a session where the average 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' for that session name is greater than 2.5.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents who participated in a session where the average 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' for that session name is greater than 2.5. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The XML data has a list of respondents, each with answers to various questions, including the session name and the 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' score. 

The key steps here are:
1. Group all respondents by their session name.
2. For each session, calculate the average of the 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' scores.
3. Identify which sessions have an average greater than 2.5.
4. Count all respondents that belong to those sessions.

Let me start by extracting all the session names and their corresponding GRS scores. Looking at the responses:

- Respondent 12: SessionName ""II (Anaphylaxis)"", GRS 3
- Respondent 1: ""V (Hypoglycemia)"", GRS 2
- Respondent 6: ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"", GRS 3
- Respondent 5: ""II - Anaphylaxsis"", GRS 3
- Respondent 19: ""I - MI"", GRS 3
- Respondent 13: ""I-VF"", GRS 2
- Respondent 3: ""III-Sepsis"", GRS 3
- Respondent 20: ""IV (VT)"", GRS 3
- Respondent 23: ""II-Anaphylaxsis"", GRS 3
- Respondent 11: ""IV (AF)"", GRS 3

Now, group these by session name. Let's list each unique session and collect their GRS scores:

1. II (Anaphylaxis): [3] (only respondent 12)
2. V (Hypoglycemia): [2] (respondent 1)
3. II (Anaphylactic Shock): [3] (respondent 6)
4. II - Anaphylaxsis: [3] (respondent 5)
5. I - MI: [3] (respondent 19)
6. I-VF: [2] (respondent 13)
7. III-Sepsis: [3] (respondent 3)
8. IV (VT): [3] (respondent 20)
9. II-Anaphylaxsis: [3] (respondent 23)
10. IV (AF): [3] (respondent 11)

Wait, but some session names might be the same but written differently. For example, ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" and ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" could be the same session but with different formatting. Similarly, ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" and ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"" might be different sessions. The problem is that the session names are open-ended, so variations in naming could be considered different sessions. However, the example given in the problem (from the example) shows that ""I - MI"" is a specific session. So, I need to treat each unique session name as a separate session, even if they are similar. 

So, proceeding with the unique session names as they are written:

Now, calculate the average GRS for each session:

1. II (Anaphylaxis): Average = 3 → 3.0
2. V (Hypoglycemia): 2 → 2.0
3. II (Anaphylactic Shock): 3 → 3.0
4. II - Anaphylaxsis: 3 → 3.0
5. I - MI: 3 → 3.0
6. I-VF: 2 → 2.0
7. III-Sepsis: 3 → 3.0
8. IV (VT): 3 → 3.0
9. II-Anaphylaxsis: 3 → 3.0
10. IV (AF): 3 → 3.0

Now, check which sessions have an average greater than 2.5. All sessions except ""V (Hypoglycemia)"" and ""I-VF"" have averages of 3.0, which is greater than 2.5. The other sessions (II (Anaphylaxis), II (Anaphylactic Shock), II - Anaphylaxsis, I - MI, III-Sepsis, IV (VT), II-Anaphylaxsis, IV (AF)) all have averages of 3.0. 

Wait, but each of these sessions has only one respondent except for the sessions that might be duplicates. Wait, no, looking back, each session name in the list has only one respondent. For example, ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" has respondent 23, and ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" has respondent 5. So each session name is unique here. Therefore, each session's average is just the single respondent's score. 

Wait, but the problem says ""average 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' for that session name"". So if a session has multiple respondents, we average their scores. But in the given data, each session name appears only once. Wait, let me check again:

Looking at the data:

- ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" has respondent 12.
- ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"" has respondent 6.
- ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" has respondent 5.
- ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" has respondent 23.

So these are four different session names, each with one respondent. Therefore, each session's average is the same as the individual's score. 

So all sessions except ""V (Hypoglycemia)"" (average 2) and ""I-VF"" (average 2) have averages of 3.0, which is above 2.5. 

Therefore, the sessions that meet the condition (average >2.5) are:

- II (Anaphylaxis)
- II (Anaphylactic Shock)
- II - Anaphylaxsis
- I - MI
- III-Sepsis
- IV (VT)
- II-Anaphylaxsis
- IV (AF)

Each of these sessions has one respondent. So the total number of respondents in these sessions is 8. 

Wait, but let me count again:

1. II (Anaphylaxis): 1
2. II (Anaphylactic Shock):1
3. II - Anaphylaxsis:1
4. I - MI:1
5. III-Sepsis:1
6. IV (VT):1
7. II-Anaphylaxsis:1
8. IV (AF):1

That's 8 respondents. But wait, looking back at the data:

Respondent 12: II (Anaphylaxis) → included
Respondent 6: II (Anaphylactic Shock) → included
Respondent 5: II - Anaphylaxsis → included
Respondent 19: I - MI → included
Respondent 3: III-Sepsis → included
Respondent 20: IV (VT) → included
Respondent 23: II-Anaphylaxsis → included
Respondent 11: IV (AF) → included

That's 8 respondents. 

But wait, the example given in the problem (the first part) had a similar question where the answer was 2. Let me check if I'm misunderstanding the session grouping. For example, maybe sessions with similar names but different formatting are considered the same. For instance, ""II (Anaphylaxis)"", ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"", ""II - Anaphylaxsis"", and ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" might all be variations of the same session. If that's the case, then the average for the ""II"" session would be the average of all their GRS scores. 

But the problem states that the session name is an open-ended question, so each variation in the name would be considered a different session. For example, ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" and ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"" are different session names. Therefore, they are treated as separate sessions. 

However, in the example provided, the user asked about ""I - MI"" and the answer was 1 respondent (respondent 19). The example's answer was 2, but in the example data, there was only one respondent with ""I - MI"". Wait, no, looking back at the example data:

In the example, the answer was 2, but the data had only one respondent (id 19) with SessionName ""I - MI"". Wait, that's confusing. Wait, the example's data had:

<example>
...
    <respondent id=""19"">
      <answer question=""SessionName"">I - MI</answer>
      ...
    </respondent>
...
</example>

And the answer given was 2. But that's a contradiction. Wait, perhaps the example had a different dataset. Wait, the example's answer was 2, but according to the data provided in the example, there was only one respondent in ""I - MI"". That suggests that perhaps the example had a mistake, or maybe I'm misunderstanding the task. 

Wait, no. Let me check the example again. The example's question was: ""How many respondents participated in a 'I - MI' session?"" The data in the example had one respondent (id 19) with SessionName ""I - MI"". The answer given was 2. That suggests that perhaps there was another respondent in the example data that I missed. Let me check again.

Looking at the example data:

In the example's responses, the respondents are:

- id 12: II (Anaphylaxis)
- id 1: V (Hypoglycemia)
- id 6: II (Anaphylactic Shock)
- id 5: II - Anaphylaxsis
- id 19: I - MI
- id 13: I-VF
- id 3: III-Sepsis
- id 20: IV (VT)
- id 23: II-Anaphylaxsis
- id 11: IV (AF)

So only respondent 19 is in ""I - MI"". The example's answer was 2, which is incorrect based on the data provided. That suggests that perhaps there was a typo, or maybe the example is illustrative but not accurate. But regardless, in the current problem, we have to work with the data provided here.

Back to the current task. The task is to count the respondents in sessions where the average GRS for that session is >2.5. 

In the current dataset, each session name is unique except for possible typos. For example, ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" (respondent 5) and ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" (respondent 23) might be the same session but with different formatting. If that's the case, then their GRS scores would be 3 and 3, average 3.0. But if they are considered different sessions, then each has an average of 3.0. 

But according to the problem's instructions, we must treat the session names as they are written. Since the question states that the SessionName is an open-ended question, each variation is a separate session. Therefore, each session name is treated as distinct. 

Therefore, all sessions except ""V (Hypoglycemia)"" and ""I-VF"" have an average GRS of 3.0, which is above 2.5. 

So the sessions that qualify are:

1. II (Anaphylaxis)
2. II (Anaphylactic Shock)
3. II - Anaphylaxsis
4. I - MI
5. III-Sepsis
6. IV (VT)
7. II-Anaphylaxsis
8. IV (AF)

Each of these sessions has one respondent. Therefore, the total number of respondents is 8. 

But wait, let me check again. The respondents in these sessions are:

- 12, 6, 5, 19, 3, 20, 23, 11. That's 8 respondents. 

So the answer should be 8. But let me double-check each session's average:

- II (Anaphylaxis): 3 → 3.0 >2.5 → include
- II (Anaphylactic Shock):3 → include
- II - Anaphylaxsis:3 → include
- I - MI:3 → include
- III-Sepsis:3 → include
- IV (VT):3 → include
- II-Anaphylaxsis:3 → include
- IV (AF):3 → include

Yes, 8 respondents. 

But wait, the example in the problem had a similar structure, and the answer was 2. But in that example, the correct answer should have been 1. Maybe the example had a different data setup. But in our current case, the answer is 8.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the respondents who participated in a session where the average 'Situation' for that session name is greater than 2.0.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents who participated in a session where the average 'Situation' score for that session name is greater than 2.0. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The XML data has a list of respondents, each with answers to various questions, including the 'SessionName' and the 'Situation' score. The 'Situation' question is a rubric-based score from 0 to 3. 

The key steps here are:
1. Group all respondents by their 'SessionName'.
2. For each session, calculate the average 'Situation' score.
3. Identify which sessions have an average greater than 2.0.
4. Count all respondents in those qualifying sessions.

Let me start by extracting all the respondents and their 'SessionName' and 'Situation' scores. 

Looking at the data:

- Respondent 3: SessionName III-Sepsis, Situation 2
- Respondent 17: V (Hypoglycemia), Situation 3
- Respondent 7: III-Sepsis, Situation 3
- Respondent 13: I-VF, Situation 3
- Respondent 14: IV-Hypoglycemia, Situation 3
- Respondent 15: III - Sepsis, Situation 3
- Respondent 11: IV (AF), Situation 3
- Respondent 6: II (Anaphylactic Shock), Situation 2

Wait, I notice that some session names might be similar but written differently. For example, ""III-Sepsis"" and ""III - Sepsis"" – are these considered the same session? The problem states to group by session name, so I have to check if these are different or the same. The names are slightly different: ""III-Sepsis"" vs. ""III - Sepsis"". The hyphen placement and spacing might indicate different sessions. But maybe it's a typo. Hmm. Let me check the data again.

Looking at the respondents:
- Respondent 3: III-Sepsis
- Respondent 7: III-Sepsis
- Respondent 15: III - Sepsis (with a space and hyphen)

Are these two different sessions or the same? The problem says to group by the exact 'SessionName' as given. So ""III-Sepsis"" and ""III - Sepsis"" would be considered different session names. Therefore, they are separate groups. But wait, maybe it's a typo. Let me check the data again. The original data in the example had ""III-Sepsis"" and ""III - Sepsis"" as separate entries. So in the given data, they are different. Therefore, they are separate sessions.

Now, let's list all session names and their corresponding 'Situation' scores:

1. III-Sepsis:
   - Respondent 3: Situation 2
   - Respondent 7: Situation 3
   Average: (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5

2. V (Hypoglycemia):
   - Respondent 17: Situation 3
   Average: 3/1 = 3.0

3. I-VF:
   - Respondent 13: Situation 3
   Average: 3/1 = 3.0

4. IV-Hypoglycemia:
   - Respondent 14: Situation 3
   Average: 3/1 = 3.0

5. III - Sepsis:
   - Respondent 15: Situation 3
   Average: 3/1 = 3.0

6. IV (AF):
   - Respondent 11: Situation 3
   Average: 3/1 = 3.0

7. II (Anaphylactic Shock):
   - Respondent 6: Situation 2
   Average: 2/1 = 2.0

Now, calculate the average for each session:

- III-Sepsis: 2.5 (which is greater than 2.0)
- V (Hypoglycemia): 3.0
- I-VF: 3.0
- IV-Hypoglycemia: 3.0
- III - Sepsis: 3.0
- IV (AF): 3.0
- II (Anaphylactic Shock): 2.0 (exactly 2.0, not greater)

Sessions with average >2.0 are: III-Sepsis, V (Hypoglycemia), I-VF, IV-Hypoglycemia, III - Sepsis, IV (AF). The session II (Anaphylactic Shock) has an average of 2.0, which doesn't meet the condition.

Now, count the number of respondents in each qualifying session:

- III-Sepsis: 2 respondents (3 and 7)
- V (Hypoglycemia): 1 (17)
- I-VF: 1 (13)
- IV-Hypoglycemia: 1 (14)
- III - Sepsis: 1 (15)
- IV (AF): 1 (11)

Total respondents: 2 +1 +1 +1 +1 +1 = 7

Wait, but let me check each session again:

Wait, III-Sepsis has respondents 3 and 7. Then III - Sepsis (with space) has respondent 15. So those are two separate sessions. So each of those sessions has 2 and 1 respondents respectively. So the total would be 2 (III-Sepsis) +1 (V) +1 (I-VF) +1 (IV-Hypoglycemia) +1 (III - Sepsis) +1 (IV (AF)) = 7 respondents.

But wait, the session III - Sepsis (respondent 15) is separate from III-Sepsis (respondents 3 and 7). So their averages are calculated separately. Both have averages above 2.0. So all their respondents count.

So total respondents in qualifying sessions: 2 (III-Sepsis) +1 (V) +1 (I-VF) +1 (IV-Hypoglycemia) +1 (III - Sepsis) +1 (IV (AF)) = 7.

But wait, let me recount:

III-Sepsis: 2 respondents (3,7)
V (Hypoglycemia): 1 (17)
I-VF: 1 (13)
IV-Hypoglycemia:1 (14)
III - Sepsis:1 (15)
IV (AF):1 (11)
Total: 2+1+1+1+1+1=7

But the answer in the example was 2. Wait, the example had a different data set. Wait, no, the example is separate. The current problem is with the data provided after the example, which is the same as the example's data. Wait, looking back, the user provided the same data twice. Wait, the user included the example with data and then the same data again in the <questionnaire> tag. Wait, no, looking at the user's input, after the example, they have another <questionnaire> block. Wait, but in the user's message, after the example, they have another questionnaire with the same data. Let me check.

Wait, the user's input is as follows: after the example, they have another <questionnaire> block. But looking at the data, it's the same as the example's data. So the data for the current task is the same as the example. Wait, but in the example, the answer was 2. But in the current task, the data is the same, but the question is different. The example's question was ""How many respondents participated in a 'I - MI' session?"" and the answer was 2. But in the current task, the question is to count respondents in sessions where the average 'Situation' score is greater than 2.0.

But in the current data, let's recheck the 'Situation' scores for each session:

Wait, let's list all respondents again with their SessionName and Situation:

Respondent 3: SessionName III-Sepsis, Situation 2
Respondent 17: V (Hypoglycemia), Situation 3
Respondent 7: III-Sepsis, Situation 3
Respondent 13: I-VF, Situation 3
Respondent 14: IV-Hypoglycemia, Situation 3
Respondent 15: III - Sepsis, Situation 3
Respondent 11: IV (AF), Situation 3
Respondent 6: II (Anaphylactic Shock), Situation 2

Grouping by SessionName:

1. III-Sepsis: respondents 3 (Sit 2) and 7 (Sit 3) → average (2+3)/2 = 2.5
2. V (Hypoglycemia): respondent 17 (3) → 3.0
3. I-VF: respondent 13 (3) → 3.0
4. IV-Hypoglycemia: respondent 14 (3) → 3.0
5. III - Sepsis: respondent 15 (3) → 3.0
6. IV (AF): respondent 11 (3) → 3.0
7. II (Anaphylactic Shock): respondent 6 (2) → 2.0

Sessions with average >2.0 are all except II (Anaphylactic Shock). So the qualifying sessions are the first six. 

Now, count the number of respondents in these sessions:

III-Sepsis: 2
V (Hypoglycemia):1
I-VF:1
IV-Hypoglycemia:1
III - Sepsis:1
IV (AF):1
Total: 2+1+1+1+1+1=7

But the example's answer was 2, but that was for a different question. So according to the current data, the answer should be 7. However, I need to make sure that the data in the current task is the same as the example. Wait, looking at the user's input, after the example, they have another <questionnaire> block. Let me check if it's the same data.

Looking at the data in the example and the data in the current task's questionnaire block, they are identical. So the same respondents are present. Therefore, the answer for the current task, based on the data provided, should be 7. But wait, let me check again.

Wait, the example's answer was 2, but that was for a different question. The current task is different. So the answer here is 7. But let me verify once more.

Wait, the sessions with average 'Situation' >2.0 are:

- III-Sepsis (2.5)
- V (Hypoglycemia) (3.0)
- I-VF (3.0)
- IV-Hypoglycemia (3.0)
- III - Sepsis (3.0)
- IV (AF) (3.0)

Each of these sessions has an average above 2.0. The number of respondents in these sessions is:

III-Sepsis: 2
V:1
I-VF:1
IV-Hypoglycemia:1
III - Sepsis:1
IV (AF):1
Total: 2+1+1+1+1+1=7

Therefore, the answer should be 7. But wait, the example's data had a session named ""I - MI"" which wasn't present in the data, but the answer was 2. But in the current data, there's a session ""I-VF"" (respondent 13). So the current task's answer is 7.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the respondents who participated in a session where the average 'Background (examination)' for that session name is greater than 2.0.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents who participated in a session where the average 'Background (examination)' score for that session name is greater than 2.0. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The XML data has a list of respondents, each with answers to various questions, including the session name and the 'Background (examination)' score. 

The key steps here are:
1. Group all respondents by their session name.
2. For each session, calculate the average of the 'Background (examination)' scores.
3. Identify which sessions have an average greater than 2.0.
4. Count all respondents that are part of those sessions.

Let me start by going through each respondent and noting their session name and 'Background (examination)' score.

Looking at the respondents:

- Respondent 10: SessionName is ""(MI)-VT"", Background (examination) = 2
- Respondent 11: SessionName ""IV (AF)"", score 3
- Respondent 19: ""I - MI"", score 3
- Respondent 20: ""IV (VT)"", score -1
- Respondent 3: ""III-Sepsis"", score 3
- Respondent 2: ""MI"", score 3
- Respondent 5: ""II - Anaphylaxsis"", score 3
- Respondent 6: ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"", score 3
- Respondent 13: ""I-VF"", score 1
- Respondent 23: ""II-Anaphylaxsis"", score 2

Now, group them by session name:

1. ""(MI)-VT"": [10] scores: 2 → average 2.0
2. ""IV (AF)"": [11] → 3 → avg 3.0
3. ""I - MI"": [19] → 3 → avg 3.0
4. ""IV (VT)"": [20] → -1 → avg -1.0
5. ""III-Sepsis"": [3] → 3 → avg 3.0
6. ""MI"": [2] → 3 → avg 3.0
7. ""II - Anaphylaxsis"": [5] → 3 → avg 3.0
8. ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"": [6] → 3 → avg 3.0
9. ""I-VF"": [13] → 1 → avg 1.0
10. ""II-Anaphylaxsis"": [23] → 2 → avg 2.0

Next, calculate the average for each session and check if it's >2.0.

Sessions with average >2.0:
- ""IV (AF)"" (3.0)
- ""I - MI"" (3.0)
- ""III-Sepsis"" (3.0)
- ""MI"" (3.0)
- ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" (3.0)
- ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"" (3.0)

Now, count the respondents in these sessions:
- ""IV (AF)"": 1 respondent (11)
- ""I - MI"": 1 (19)
- ""III-Sepsis"": 1 (3)
- ""MI"": 1 (2)
- ""II - Anaphylaxsis"": 1 (5)
- ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"": 1 (6)

Total respondents: 1+1+1+1+1+1 = 6

Wait, but let me double-check. The sessions with averages over 2.0 are those where the average is greater than 2.0. The average must be >2.0. So, sessions with average 3.0 are included. The sessions with average 2.0 (like ""(MI)-VT"" and ""II-Anaphylaxsis"") are not included. 

So the correct sessions are the six I listed. Each of these sessions has one respondent. So total respondents are 6. But wait, looking back at the data:

Wait, the session ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" has respondent 5, and ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"" has respondent 6. Are these considered the same session? The session names are different: ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" vs. ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"". So they are separate sessions. Similarly, ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" (respondent 23) is another variation, but that session's average is 2.0, so it's excluded. 

So each of the six sessions has one respondent each. Therefore, the total number of respondents is 6. But wait, let me check again:

Wait, looking at the data:

Respondent 5: ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" (score 3)
Respondent 6: ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"" (score 3)
Respondent 23: ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" (score 2)

These are three different session names. So each is a separate session. The average for ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" is 3.0 (only respondent 5), ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"" is 3.0 (respondent 6), and ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" is 2.0 (respondent 23). So the first two are included, the third is not. 

So the sessions with average >2.0 are:

- IV (AF) (1)
- I - MI (1)
- III-Sepsis (1)
- MI (1)
- II - Anaphylaxsis (1)
- II (Anaphylactic Shock) (1)

Total respondents: 6. 

Therefore, the answer should be 6.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who participated in a session where the average 'Assessment' for that session name is greater than 2.5.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents who participated in a session where the average 'Assessment' score for that session name is greater than 2.5. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The XML data has a list of respondents, each with answers to various questions, including the session name and the 'Assessment' score. The 'Assessment' question uses a rubric from 0 to 3. 

So, the plan is:
1. Group all respondents by their session name.
2. For each session group, calculate the average 'Assessment' score.
3. Identify which sessions have an average greater than 2.5.
4. Count all respondents in those sessions.

Looking at the data, each respondent has a 'SessionName' and an 'Assessment' value. Let's list out each respondent's session and their assessment score.

From the responses:

- Respondent 22: SessionName ""IV (VT)"", Assessment 2
- Respondent 3: SessionName ""III-Sepsis"", Assessment 3
- Respondent 9: SessionName ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"", Assessment 2
- Respondent 15: SessionName ""III - Sepsis"", Assessment 2
- Respondent 14: SessionName ""IV-Hypoglycemia"", Assessment 3
- Respondent 16: SessionName ""I - MI"", Assessment 3
- Respondent 20: SessionName ""IV (VT)"", Assessment 3
- Respondent 19: SessionName ""I - MI"", Assessment 2

Now, group by SessionName:

1. IV (VT): Respondents 22 (2) and 20 (3). Average = (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5. Not greater than 2.5.
2. III-Sepsis: Respondent 3 (3). Average = 3.0. Greater than 2.5.
3. II (Anaphylaxsis): Respondent 9 (2). Average = 2.0. Not.
4. III - Sepsis: Respondent 15 (2). Average = 2.0. Not. Wait, but ""III-Sepsis"" and ""III - Sepsis"" might be the same session with different formatting. Need to check if they should be grouped together. The names are ""III-Sepsis"" and ""III - Sepsis"". The hyphen spacing might be a typo. If they are considered the same session, then combining respondents 3 (3) and 15 (2) would give an average of (3+2)/2=2.5, which is not greater than 2.5. But if they are separate, then III-Sepsis has 3.0 average. Need to check the data. The original data shows ""III-Sepsis"" for respondent 3 and ""III - Sepsis"" for 15. Since the names are slightly different, they might be considered separate sessions. So, III-Sepsis (3) has average 3.0, III - Sepsis (15) has 2.0. So only III-Sepsis (respondent 3) would count.

5. IV-Hypoglycemia: Respondent 14 (3). Average 3.0. Greater than 2.5.
6. I - MI: Respondents 16 (3) and 19 (2). Average (3+2)/2=2.5. Not greater than 2.5.

So sessions with average >2.5 are III-Sepsis (3.0) and IV-Hypoglycemia (3.0). 

Now, count the respondents in these sessions. 

III-Sepsis: 1 respondent (id 3)
IV-Hypoglycemia: 1 respondent (id 14)

Total respondents: 2.

Wait, but let me double-check. 

Wait, IV-Hypoglycemia has respondent 14 with Assessment 3. So average is 3.0, which is greater than 2.5. So that's one session. III-Sepsis (respondent 3) has average 3.0. So two sessions. Each has one respondent. So total respondents is 1 + 1 = 2.

But wait, the answer in the example was 2 for a similar question. Let me check again.

Wait, the example had two respondents in ""I - MI"" (ids 16 and 19), and the answer was 2. But in this task, the sessions with average >2.5 are III-Sepsis (1) and IV-Hypoglycemia (1), totaling 2 respondents. So the answer should be 2.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

How many respondents whose comments contain 'Good' also have a total score across all rubric items that is below the average total score for all sessions?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking: How many respondents whose comments contain 'Good' also have a total score across all rubric items that is below the average total score for all sessions?

First, I need to break down the requirements. There are two main parts here:

1. Identify all respondents whose comments include the word 'Good'.
2. For those respondents, calculate their total rubric scores and compare them to the average total score of all sessions to see if they are below that average.

Let me start by understanding the data structure. The XML data has a questionnaire with questions and responses. The responses include various answers, including comments and rubric scores. The rubric items are the questions with numerical scores (0-3), like Identification, Situation, Background (history), etc. The comments are open-ended text fields.

First, I need to parse through each respondent's data. For each respondent, I need to check if their comment contains the word 'Good'. Then, for those who do, calculate their total score across all rubric items. Then, compute the average total score across all respondents and see how many of the 'Good' commenters have a total below that average.

Let me list out the steps:

1. **Extract all respondents' data.**
2. **Identify which respondents have 'Good' in their comments.**
3. **Calculate each respondent's total rubric score.**
4. **Compute the average total score across all respondents.**
5. **For the respondents with 'Good' in comments, check if their total is below the average.**
6. **Count how many meet both criteria.**

Starting with step 1: Extract all respondents. Looking at the data, there are 10 respondents with IDs 7, 17, 4, 12, 14, 21, 10, 16, 9, 11.

Step 2: Check comments for 'Good'. Let's go through each respondent's comments:

- Respondent 7: Comments: ""Time: (1:00-1:17)"" → No 'Good'.
- Respondent 17: ""Concise - clear Satisfactory"" → No 'Good'.
- Respondent 4: ""Clinical handover... Satisfactory"" → No 'Good'.
- Respondent 12: ""Good"" → Yes.
- Respondent 14: ""Time... Late response..."" → No.
- Respondent 21: ""Diagnostic clarity... Good..."" → Yes.
- Respondent 10: ""Time..."" → No.
- Respondent 16: ""Consent denied... Satisfactory"" → No.
- Respondent 9: ""Overall a bit unclear..."" → No.
- Respondent 11: ""Clear communication..."" → No.

So respondents 12 and 21 have 'Good' in their comments.

Step 3: Calculate total rubric scores for each respondent. The rubric items are: Identification, Situation, Background (history), Background (examination), Assessment, Recommendation (clear recommendation), Recommendation (global rating scale). Each of these is scored 0-3. Let's compute each respondent's total.

Let me create a table:

Respondent ID | Identification | Situation | Background (history) | Background (examination) | Assessment | Rec (clear) | GRS | Total
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
7 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 3+3+2+3+2+2+2 = 17
17 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 3+3+3+3+3+3+2=20
4 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 3+3+3+2+2+2+2=17
12 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 3 | 3 | 3+3+3+3+2+3+3=20
14 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 2 | 3 | 1 | 2 | 3+3+2+2+3+1+2=16
21 | 3 | 2 | 3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 3 | 3+2+3+1+2+3+3=17
10 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2+2+2+2+2+2+2=14
16 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 3 | 3+3+3+3+3+2+3=20
9 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 3+3+2+2+2+3+2=17
11 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3+3+3+3+3+3+3=21

Now, let's list all totals:

- 7: 17
- 17: 20
- 4: 17
- 12: 20
- 14: 16
- 21: 17
- 10:14
- 16:20
- 9:17
- 11:21

Now, compute the average total score. Sum all totals and divide by 10.

Sum = 17+20+17+20+16+17+14+20+17+21 = let's calculate:

17+20=37; 37+17=54; 54+20=74; 74+16=90; 90+17=107; 107+14=121; 121+20=141; 141+17=158; 158+21=179.

Total sum is 179. Average = 179 / 10 = 17.9.

So the average total score is 17.9.

Now, check the respondents with 'Good' in comments: 12 and 21.

Respondent 12's total is 20, which is above 17.9.

Respondent 21's total is 17, which is below 17.9.

So only respondent 21 meets both criteria. Therefore, the count is 1.

Wait, but let me double-check. The question is asking for respondents whose comments contain 'Good' and have a total score below the average. So among the two (12 and 21), only 21's total is 17, which is below 17.9. Respondent 12's total is 20, which is above. So the answer is 1.

But wait, let me check the comments again. Respondent 12's comment is ""Good"". Respondent 21's comment is ""Diagnostic clarity is present Good and early assessment of condition is done"". So both have 'Good' in comments. But their totals are 20 and 17. The average is 17.9. So 17 is below, 20 is above. So only 21. So the answer is 1.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who participated in a session where the average 'Situation' for that session name is greater than 2.0.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents who participated in a session where the average 'Situation' score for that session name is greater than 2.0. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The data provided has a list of respondents, each with their answers to various questions, including the 'SessionName' and the 'Situation' score. The 'Situation' question is a rubric-based score from 0 to 3. 

The key steps here are:
1. Group all respondents by their 'SessionName'.
2. For each session group, calculate the average 'Situation' score.
3. Identify which session names have an average 'Situation' score greater than 2.0.
4. Count all respondents that belong to those sessions.

Let me start by listing all the respondents and their SessionNames along with their 'Situation' scores.

Looking at the responses:

- Respondent 2: SessionName ""MI"", Situation 3
- Respondent 8: SessionName ""III (Sepsis)"", Situation 3
- Respondent 13: SessionName ""I-VF"", Situation 3
- Respondent 20: SessionName ""IV (VT)"", Situation 3
- Respondent 23: SessionName ""II-Anaphylaxsis"", Situation 3
- Respondent 1: SessionName ""V (Hypoglycemia)"", Situation 2
- Respondent 7: SessionName ""III-Sepsis"", Situation 3
- Respondent 10: SessionName ""(MI)-VT"", Situation 2
- Respondent 4: SessionName ""III (Sepsis)"", Situation 3
- Respondent 21: SessionName ""I (Myocardial infarction)"", Situation 2

Now, group them by SessionName. But I need to check if different names might refer to the same session. For example, ""III (Sepsis)"" and ""III-Sepsis"" could be the same session. Similarly, ""MI"" and ""I (Myocardial infarction)"" might be related. However, the SessionNames are written differently, so unless explicitly stated, they should be considered separate. Let's proceed with the exact names as given.

Grouping:

1. MI: Respondent 2 (Situation 3)
2. III (Sepsis): Respondents 8 and 4 (both Situation 3)
3. I-VF: Respondent 13 (Situation 3)
4. IV (VT): Respondent 20 (Situation 3)
5. II-Anaphylaxsis: Respondent 23 (Situation 3)
6. V (Hypoglycemia): Respondent 1 (Situation 2)
7. III-Sepsis: Respondent 7 (Situation 3)
8. (MI)-VT: Respondent 10 (Situation 2)
9. I (Myocardial infarction): Respondent 21 (Situation 2)

Now, calculate the average 'Situation' score for each session:

1. MI: 3 (only one respondent) → average 3.0
2. III (Sepsis): 3 and 3 → average 3.0
3. I-VF: 3 → average 3.0
4. IV (VT): 3 → average 3.0
5. II-Anaphylaxsis: 3 → average 3.0
6. V (Hypoglycemia): 2 → average 2.0
7. III-Sepsis: 3 → average 3.0
8. (MI)-VT: 2 → average 2.0
9. I (Myocardial infarction): 2 → average 2.0

Next, determine which sessions have an average greater than 2.0. All sessions except V (Hypoglycemia), (MI)-VT, and I (Myocardial infarction) have averages of 3.0, which is greater than 2.0. The sessions with averages <=2.0 are V (Hypoglycemia), (MI)-VT, and I (Myocardial infarction), each with average 2.0. Wait, the task says ""greater than 2.0"", so averages equal to 2.0 don't count. So sessions with average >2.0 are those with 3.0. 

So the qualifying sessions are: MI, III (Sepsis), I-VF, IV (VT), II-Anaphylaxsis, III-Sepsis. 

Now, count the number of respondents in these sessions:

- MI: 1 (Respondent 2)
- III (Sepsis): 2 (8 and 4)
- I-VF: 1 (13)
- IV (VT): 1 (20)
- II-Anaphylaxsis: 1 (23)
- III-Sepsis: 1 (7)

Total respondents: 1+2+1+1+1+1 = 7.

Wait, but let me check again. The session ""III (Sepsis)"" has two respondents (8 and 4), and ""III-Sepsis"" is another session with respondent 7. Are these considered the same session? The SessionNames are ""III (Sepsis)"" and ""III-Sepsis"". The names are slightly different, so unless the data indicates they are the same, they should be treated as separate. Therefore, each is a separate session. 

So, the qualifying sessions are:

1. MI (1)
2. III (Sepsis) (2)
3. I-VF (1)
4. IV (VT) (1)
5. II-Anaphylaxsis (1)
6. III-Sepsis (1)

Total respondents: 1+2+1+1+1+1 = 7.

But wait, the example given in the problem had a similar structure. In the example, the answer was 2 for 'I - MI' session. Looking at the example data, the SessionNames included ""MI"" and ""(MI)-VT"", but the answer was 2. So in that case, the user considered exact matches. Therefore, in this problem, we need to treat SessionNames as exact strings. 

Therefore, the sessions with average >2.0 are those where the average is 3.0. Each of these sessions has an average of 3.0. So the count is 1 (MI) + 2 (III (Sepsis)) +1 (I-VF) +1 (IV (VT)) +1 (II-Anaphylaxsis) +1 (III-Sepsis) = 7 respondents. 

But wait, let me check each session's average again:

- MI: 3 → 3.0
- III (Sepsis): 3 and 3 → 3.0
- I-VF: 3 → 3.0
- IV (VT): 3 → 3.0
- II-Anaphylaxsis: 3 → 3.0
- III-Sepsis: 3 → 3.0
- (MI)-VT: 2 → 2.0 (doesn't qualify)
- V (Hypoglycemia): 2 → 2.0 (doesn't qualify)
- I (Myocardial infarction): 2 → 2.0 (doesn't qualify)

So the qualifying sessions are 6 in total. The respondents in these sessions are:

- MI: 1
- III (Sepsis): 2
- I-VF:1
- IV (VT):1
- II-Anaphylaxsis:1
- III-Sepsis:1

Total: 1+2+1+1+1+1=7.

Therefore, the answer should be 7.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
How many respondents have a 'Identification' score that is higher than the average 'Identification' for all sessions on the same date?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking how many respondents have an 'Identification' score higher than the average 'Identification' score for all sessions on the same date. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The XML data has a list of respondents, each with various answers, including the 'Date' and 'Identification' score. The 'Identification' question uses a rubric from 0 to 3. 

The plan is to:
1. Group respondents by their session date.
2. Calculate the average 'Identification' score for each date.
3. Compare each respondent's 'Identification' score to their date's average.
4. Count how many have a score higher than the average.

Let me start by extracting all the respondents and their dates and Identification scores. 

Looking at the data:

Respondent 9: Date 2025-05-04, Identification 3
Respondent 10: 2025-03-14, 2
Respondent 11: 2025-04-04, 3
Respondent 4: 2025-05-16, 3
Respondent 1: 2025-05-02, -1 (Wait, the rubric is 0-3. Hmm, maybe a typo? But the data shows -1. I'll have to include it as is unless instructed otherwise.)
Respondent 16: 2025-05-02, 3
Respondent 14: 2025-03-14, 3
Respondent 6: 2025-04-04, 3
Respondent 3: 2025-04-04, 0

Now, group by date:

2025-05-04: [3]
2025-03-14: [2, 3]
2025-04-04: [3, 3, 0]
2025-05-16: [3]
2025-05-02: [-1, 3]

For each date, calculate the average:

2025-05-04: Only one respondent, average is 3.
2025-03-14: (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5
2025-04-04: (3 + 3 + 0)/3 = 2
2025-05-16: 3
2025-05-02: (-1 + 3)/2 = 1

Now, compare each respondent's score to their date's average:

Respondent 9 (2025-05-04, 3 vs 3): Not higher. Equal, so no.
Respondent 10 (2025-03-14, 2 vs 2.5): 2 < 2.5 → No.
Respondent 11 (2025-04-04, 3 vs 2): 3 > 2 → Yes.
Respondent 4 (2025-05-16, 3 vs 3): Equal → No.
Respondent 1 (2025-05-02, -1 vs 1): -1 < 1 → No.
Respondent 16 (2025-05-02, 3 vs 1): 3 > 1 → Yes.
Respondent 14 (2025-03-14, 3 vs 2.5): 3 > 2.5 → Yes.
Respondent 6 (2025-04-04, 3 vs 2): 3 > 2 → Yes.
Respondent 3 (2025-04-04, 0 vs 2): 0 < 2 → No.

Now count the ""Yes"" cases: Respondents 11, 16, 14, 6. That's 4 respondents.

Wait, let me double-check:

For 2025-04-04, average is 2. Respondents 11 (3), 6 (3), 3 (0). So 3 and 3 are higher than 2. So two here.

2025-03-14: average 2.5. Respondent 10 (2) and 14 (3). Only 14 is higher.

2025-05-02: average 1. Respondent 1 (-1) and 16 (3). Only 16 is higher.

So total: 14 (3), 11 (3), 6 (3), 16 (3). That's four respondents. So the answer should be 4.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
How many respondents have a 'Background (examination)' score that is higher than the average 'Background (examination)' for all sessions on the same date?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find out how many respondents have a 'Background (examination)' score higher than the average for all sessions on the same date. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The XML has a responses section with multiple respondents, each having answers to various questions. The relevant question here is ""Background (examination)"" with a rubric score from 0 to 3. Each respondent also has a date for their session.

The plan is:

1. **Extract all 'Background (examination)' scores along with their dates.**
   - Go through each respondent and note their date and the score for Background (examination).

2. **Calculate the average score for each date.**
   - Group the scores by date and compute the average for each group.

3. **Compare each respondent's score to the average of their respective date group.**
   - For each respondent, check if their score is higher than the average of the date they belong to.

4. **Count how many respondents meet this condition.**

Let's start by extracting the data. Looking at the responses:

- Respondent 18: Date 2025-05-04, score 2
- Respondent 8: 2025-05-02, score 2
- Respondent 17: 2025-05-04, score 3
- Respondent 23: 2025-03-14, score 2
- Respondent 12: 2025-05-02, score 3
- Respondent 3: 2025-04-04, score 3
- Respondent 13: 2025-03-14, score 1
- Respondent 2: 2025-04-04, score 3
- Respondent 7: 2025-03-14, score 3
- Respondent 1: 2025-05-02, score 2
- Respondent 22: 2025-05-16, score 3

Now, group by date and calculate averages:

- **2025-03-14**: Respondents 23 (2), 13 (1), 7 (3)
  - Scores: 2, 1, 3 → sum 6 → average 6/3 = 2.0

- **2025-04-04**: Respondents 3 (3), 2 (3)
  - Scores: 3, 3 → sum 6 → average 6/2 = 3.0

- **2025-05-02**: Respondents 8 (2), 12 (3), 1 (2)
  - Scores: 2, 3, 2 → sum 7 → average 7/3 ≈ 2.33

- **2025-05-04**: Respondents 18 (2), 17 (3)
  - Scores: 2, 3 → sum 5 → average 5/2 = 2.5

- **2025-05-16**: Respondent 22 (3)
  - Only one score, average is 3.0

Now, compare each respondent's score to their date's average:

- **2025-03-14 (avg 2.0):**
  - 23: 2 → equal, not higher
  - 13: 1 → lower
  - 7: 3 → higher (3 > 2.0) ✅

- **2025-04-04 (avg 3.0):**
  - 3: 3 → equal
  - 2: 3 → equal

- **2025-05-02 (avg ~2.33):**
  - 8: 2 → lower (2 < 2.33)
  - 12: 3 → higher (3 > 2.33) ✅
  - 1: 2 → lower

- **2025-05-04 (avg 2.5):**
  - 18: 2 → lower
  - 17: 3 → higher (3 > 2.5) ✅

- **2025-05-16 (avg 3.0):**
  - 22: 3 → equal

So the respondents with scores higher than their date's average are:
- Respondent 7 (2025-03-14)
- Respondent 12 (2025-05-02)
- Respondent 17 (2025-05-04)

That's a total of 3 respondents.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents whose comments contain 'Clear' also have a total score across all rubric items that is below the average total score for all sessions?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking: How many respondents whose comments contain 'Clear' also have a total score across all rubric items that is below the average total score for all sessions?

First, I need to break down the problem into parts. 

1. Identify all respondents whose comments include the word 'Clear' (case-insensitive? The example shows 'Clear communication' so probably case-sensitive as per data).
2. Calculate each respondent's total score by summing all rubric items. The rubric items are the questions with numerical scores (0-3). These are: Identification, Situation, Background (history), Background (examination), Assessment, Recommendation (clear recommendation), Recommendation (global rating scale). The other questions (Date, SessionName, Comments) are open-ended and not scored.
3. Compute the average total score across all sessions.
4. For each respondent from step 1, check if their total score is below the average from step 3.
5. Count how many such respondents there are.

Let's start by listing all respondents and their comments. Looking at the data:

Respondent 11: Comments: ""Clear communication and handover"" → contains 'Clear'.
Respondent 19: Comments: ""Wrong CPR position Clarity is a bit low over whole case scenario Satisfactory"" → 'Clarity' is present but not 'Clear'? Hmm, maybe. Wait, the exact comment is: ""Clarity is a bit low over whole case scenario"". So 'Clarity' is there, but not 'Clear'. So maybe not. But need to check case. The user might be looking for exact 'Clear' in the comments. Let's check all.

Respondent 14: Comments mention 'Late response...' → no 'Clear'.
Respondent 22: ""Clear communication skills Good"" → contains 'Clear'.
Respondent 13: ""Lack of communication..."" → no.
Respondent 21: ""Diagnostic clarity is present..."" → 'clarity' but not 'Clear'.
Respondent 10: No 'Clear' in comments.
Respondent 4: ""Clinical handover and communication skills, satisfactory..."" → no.

So respondents with 'Clear' in comments are 11 and 22. Wait, let me check again:

Respondent 11: ""Clear communication and handover"" → yes.
Respondent 19: ""Clarity is a bit low..."" → 'Clarity' is different from 'Clear', so no.
Respondent 22: ""Clear communication skills Good"" → yes.
Any others? Respondent 4's comment: ""Clinical handover..."" → 'Clinical' not 'Clear'. So total of two respondents: 11 and 22.

Wait, but let me check again. The task says ""comments contain 'Clear'"". So case-sensitive? The data shows 'Clear' in 11 and 22. So those two.

Next, calculate their total scores.

For each respondent, sum the scores of the rubric items. The rubric items are:

- Identification
- Situation
- Background (history)
- Background (examination)
- Assessment
- Recommendation (clear recommendation)
- Recommendation (global rating scale)

So for each respondent, sum these seven scores.

Let's start with respondent 11:

Answers:
Identification: 3
Situation: 3
Background (history):3
Background (examination):3
Assessment:3
Recommendation (clear recommendation):3
Recommendation (global rating scale):3

Total = 3+3+3+3+3+3+3 = 21.

Respondent 22:

Answers:
Identification:3
Situation:3
Background (history):3
Background (examination):3
Assessment:2
Recommendation (clear recommendation):2
Recommendation (global rating scale):3

Total: 3+3+3+3+2+2+3 = 19.

Now, compute the average total score for all sessions. So we need to calculate the total score for each respondent (all 8 respondents) and then find the average.

Let's list all respondents and their total scores:

Respondent 11: 21
Respondent 19: Let's calculate:

Answers:
Identification:3
Situation:3
Background (history):3
Background (examination):3
Assessment:2
Recommendation (clear recommendation):3
GRS:3

Total: 3+3+3+3+2+3+3 = 20.

Respondent 14:

Answers:
Identification:3
Situation:3
Background (history):2
Background (examination):2
Assessment:3
Recommendation (clear recommendation):1
GRS:2

Total: 3+3+2+2+3+1+2 = 16.

Respondent 22: 19 (as above)
Respondent 13:

Answers:
Identification:3
Situation:3
Background (history):2
Background (examination):1
Assessment:2
Recommendation (clear recommendation):2
GRS:2

Total: 3+3+2+1+2+2+2 = 15.

Respondent 21:

Answers:
Identification:3
Situation:2
Background (history):3
Background (examination):1
Assessment:2
Recommendation (clear recommendation):3
GRS:3

Total:3+2+3+1+2+3+3= 17.

Respondent 10:

Answers:
Identification:2
Situation:2
Background (history):2
Background (examination):2
Assessment:2
Recommendation (clear recommendation):2
GRS:2

Total:2+2+2+2+2+2+2=14.

Respondent 4:

Answers:
Identification:3
Situation:3
Background (history):3
Background (examination):2
Assessment:2
Recommendation (clear recommendation):2
GRS:2

Total:3+3+3+2+2+2+2=17.

So all totals:

11:21

19:20

14:16

22:19

13:15

21:17

10:14

4:17

Now, sum all these totals and divide by 8 (number of respondents).

Sum = 21 +20 +16 +19 +15 +17 +14 +17 = Let's compute:

21+20=41

41+16=57

57+19=76

76+15=91

91+17=108

108+14=122

122+17=139.

Average = 139 /8 = 17.375.

So the average total score is 17.375.

Now, check the respondents with 'Clear' in comments (11 and 22) and see if their total scores are below this average.

Respondent 11: 21. 21 is above 17.375 → so no.

Respondent 22: 19. 19 is above 17.375 → so no.

Wait, but wait, 19 is higher than 17.375. So neither of them have a total below the average. But that can't be right. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, 17.375 is the average. So any total below that would be 17 or lower. Let's check:

Respondent 11:21 → above.

Respondent 22:19 → above.

So none of the respondents with 'Clear' in comments have a total below average. But that would mean the answer is 0. But let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I missed other respondents with 'Clear' in comments. Let me recheck the comments.

Looking back:

Respondent 4's comment: ""Clinical handover and communication skills, satisfactory..."" → 'Clinical' not 'Clear'.

Respondent 21: ""Diagnostic clarity is present..."" → 'clarity' not 'Clear'.

Respondent 19: ""Clarity is a bit low..."" → 'Clarity' again.

So only 11 and 22 have 'Clear' in comments.

But their totals are 21 and 19, both above 17.375. So the answer would be 0.

But wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the average. Let me recheck the sum.

Total scores:

11:21

19:20

14:16

22:19

13:15

21:17

10:14

4:17

Adding these:

21 +20 =41

41 +16=57

57 +19=76

76 +15=91

91 +17=108

108 +14=122

122 +17=139.

Yes, sum is 139. 139 divided by 8 is 17.375. Correct.

So the average is 17.375. So any total below that is 17 or lower. The two respondents with 'Clear' in comments have 21 and 19, both above. Therefore, the answer is 0.

But wait, maybe I missed a respondent. Let me check again.

Wait, respondent 22's total is 19, which is above 17.375. So no. So none of the 'Clear' commenters are below average. So the answer is 0.

But the example given in the problem had an answer of 2, but that was for a different question. So in this case, the answer is 0.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents whose comments contain 'Satisfactory' also have a total score across all rubric items that is below the average total score for all sessions?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find out how many respondents have comments containing 'Satisfactory' and also have a total score below the average total score of all sessions. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The XML has a list of respondents, each with answers to various questions. The questions include rubric-based scores and open-ended comments. The key here is to calculate each respondent's total score, find the average total score across all respondents, then check which respondents with 'Satisfactory' in their comments have totals below that average.

Let me start by identifying which questions are rubric items. Looking at the questions section, the rubric-based questions are: Identification, Situation, Background (history), Background (examination), Assessment, Recommendation (clear recommendation), and Recommendation (global rating scale). Each of these has a rubric from 0 to 3. 

For each respondent, I need to sum the scores of these seven questions. But wait, I should check if any of the answers are invalid, like negative numbers. For example, in the example data, respondent 1 has an Identification score of -1. How should that be handled? The rubric for Identification starts at 0, so maybe -1 is a missing value or an error. But the problem statement doesn't mention handling such cases, so perhaps we should treat them as their numerical value. However, since the rubric doesn't include negative scores, maybe those entries are mistakes. But since the user hasn't specified, I'll proceed by taking the values as they are, including -1. 

Next, calculate the total score for each respondent. Let's list all respondents and their scores:

Looking at the responses:

Respondent 1:
- Identification: -1
- Situation: 2
- Background (history): 2
- Background (examination): 2
- Assessment: 3
- Recommendation (clear recommendation): 2
- GRS: 2
Total: (-1) + 2 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 2 = 12

Respondent 11:
All rubric scores are 3 except maybe? Let's check:
- Identification:3, Situation:3, History:3, Exam:3, Assessment:3, Rec:3, GRS:3. Total: 3*7=21

Respondent 6:
Scores: 3,2,3,3,2,2,3. Wait, let's check each:
Identification:3, Situation:2, History:3, Exam:3, Assessment:2, Rec:2, GRS:3. Total: 3+2+3+3+2+2+3= 18

Respondent 20:
Scores:3,3,2,-1,3,2,3. Wait, let's check:
Identification:3, Situation:3, History:2, Exam:-1, Assessment:3, Rec:2, GRS:3. Total: 3+3+2+(-1)+3+2+3= 15

Respondent 15:
Scores:3,3,2,3,2,2,2. Let's add: 3+3+2+3+2+2+2=17

Respondent 12:
Scores:3,3,3,3,2,3,3. Total: 3+3+3+3+2+3+3=20

Respondent 3:
Scores:0,2,3,3,3,3,3. Total:0+2+3+3+3+3+3=17

Respondent 14:
Scores:3,3,2,2,3,1,2. Total:3+3+2+2+3+1+2=16

Respondent 16:
Scores:3,3,3,3,3,2,3. Total:3+3+3+3+3+2+3=20

Respondent 2:
Scores:3,3,2,3,3,2,1. Total:3+3+2+3+3+2+1=17

Respondent 4:
Scores:3,3,3,2,2,2,2. Total:3+3+3+2+2+2+2=17

Wait, let me double-check each to avoid mistakes:

Respondent 1: -1+2+2+2+3+2+2 = (-1) + 2=1; 1+2=3; 3+2=5; 5+3=8; 8+2=10; 10+2=12. Correct.

Respondent 11: All 3s. 3*7=21.

Respondent 6: 3 (ID) +2 (Sit) +3 (Hist) +3 (Exam) +2 (Assess) +2 (Rec) +3 (GRS) = 3+2=5, +3=8, +3=11, +2=13, +2=15, +3=18. Correct.

Respondent 20: 3 (ID) +3 (Sit) +2 (Hist) + (-1) (Exam) +3 (Assess) +2 (Rec) +3 (GRS) = 3+3=6, +2=8, -1=7, +3=10, +2=12, +3=15. Correct.

Respondent 15: 3 (ID) +3 (Sit) +2 (Hist) +3 (Exam) +2 (Assess) +2 (Rec) +2 (GRS) = 3+3=6, +2=8, +3=11, +2=13, +2=15, +2=17. Correct.

Respondent 12: 3 (ID) +3 (Sit) +3 (Hist) +3 (Exam) +2 (Assess) +3 (Rec) +3 (GRS) = 3+3=6, +3=9, +3=12, +2=14, +3=17, +3=20. Correct.

Respondent 3: 0 (ID) +2 (Sit) +3 (Hist) +3 (Exam) +3 (Assess) +3 (Rec) +3 (GRS) = 0+2=2, +3=5, +3=8, +3=11, +3=14, +3=17. Correct.

Respondent 14: 3 (ID) +3 (Sit) +2 (Hist) +2 (Exam) +3 (Assess) +1 (Rec) +2 (GRS) = 3+3=6, +2=8, +2=10, +3=13, +1=14, +2=16. Correct.

Respondent 16: 3 (ID) +3 (Sit) +3 (Hist) +3 (Exam) +3 (Assess) +2 (Rec) +3 (GRS) = 3+3=6, +3=9, +3=12, +3=15, +2=17, +3=20. Correct.

Respondent 2: 3 (ID) +3 (Sit) +2 (Hist) +3 (Exam) +3 (Assess) +2 (Rec) +1 (GRS) = 3+3=6, +2=8, +3=11, +3=14, +2=16, +1=17. Correct.

Respondent 4: 3 (ID) +3 (Sit) +3 (Hist) +2 (Exam) +2 (Assess) +2 (Rec) +2 (GRS) = 3+3=6, +3=9, +2=11, +2=13, +2=15, +2=17. Correct.

Now, list all the totals:

Respondent 1: 12

Respondent 11:21

Respondent 6:18

Respondent 20:15

Respondent 15:17

Respondent 12:20

Respondent 3:17

Respondent 14:16

Respondent 16:20

Respondent 2:17

Respondent 4:17

Now, calculate the average total score. Sum all these totals and divide by the number of respondents (11).

Sum = 12 +21 +18 +15 +17 +20 +17 +16 +20 +17 +17.

Let's compute step by step:

12 +21 =33

33+18=51

51+15=66

66+17=83

83+20=103

103+17=120

120+16=136

136+20=156

156+17=173

173+17=190

Total sum is 190. Number of respondents is 11. Average = 190 / 11 ≈17.27.

So the average total score is approximately 17.27.

Now, we need to find respondents whose comments include 'Satisfactory' and have a total score below 17.27.

Check each respondent's comments:

Respondent 1: Comments: ""Satisfactory"" — total 12 (which is below 17.27)

Respondent 11: Comments: ""Clear communication and handover"" — no 'Satisfactory'

Respondent 6: Comments: empty — no

Respondent 20: Comments: ""Good"" — no

Respondent 15: Comments: ""Detailed Response - clear communication"" — no 'Satisfactory'

Respondent 12: Comments: ""Good"" — no

Respondent 3: Comments: mentions ""Clear communication..."" but not 'Satisfactory'

Respondent 14: Comments: mentions ""Late response..."" — no

Respondent 16: Comments: ""Consent denied for video recordings Satisfactory"" — contains 'Satisfactory'. Total score is 20, which is above 17.27. So this doesn't count.

Respondent 2: Comments: empty — no

Respondent 4: Comments: ""Clinical handover... Satisfactory"" — contains 'Satisfactory'. Total score is 17, which is below 17.27? Wait, 17 is less than 17.27. So yes.

Wait, respondent 4's total is 17, which is below 17.27. So that's another one.

Wait, let's check again:

Respondent 1: Comments: ""Satisfactory"" — total 12 (below average)

Respondent 16: Comments: ""Satisfactory"" — total 20 (above average)

Respondent 4: Comments: ""Satisfactory"" — total 17 (below average)

Wait, in the data:

Respondent 4's comments: ""Clinical handover and communication skills, satisfactory No panic, no arrest team Satisfactory""

So the comments include 'satisfactory' twice. So yes, it's included.

So respondents 1, 4, and 16 have 'Satisfactory' in comments. But 16's total is 20, which is above average. So only 1 and 4.

Wait, let's check all comments again:

Looking at each respondent's comments:

Respondent 1: ""Satisfactory""

Respondent 11: ""Clear communication and handover""

Respondent 6: (empty)

Respondent 20: ""Good""

Respondent 15: ""Detailed Response - clear communication""

Respondent 12: ""Good""

Respondent 3: ""The patient/simulation is not oriented in TPP. Clear communication between Reg and colleague during handover""

Respondent 14: ""Time: (2:36-2:53) Late response for considering consultation""

Respondent 16: ""Consent denied for video recordings Satisfactory""

Respondent 2: (empty)

Respondent 4: ""Clinical handover and communication skills, satisfactory No panic, no arrest team Satisfactory""

So respondents 1, 16, and 4 have 'Satisfactory' in their comments.

Now check their totals:

Respondent 1: 12 (below 17.27)

Respondent 16: 20 (above)

Respondent 4: 17 (below 17.27)

So that's two respondents: 1 and 4.

Wait, but respondent 4's total is 17, which is 17.0, and the average is approximately 17.27. So 17 is below 17.27. So yes, it counts.

So the answer is 2 respondents: respondent 1 and 4. Therefore, the count is 2.
