</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents participated in a 'IV - VT' session?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question. The task is to find out how many respondents participated in a session named 'IV - VT'. 

First, I need to look through the responses and check each respondent's SessionName. The key here is to match the exact session name as given in the question, which is 'IV - VT'. But I should also be careful about variations in the formatting. For example, some entries might have hyphens, spaces, or parentheses differently.

Looking at the data:

- Respondent 1: SessionName is ""V (Hypoglycemia)"" – not a match.
- Respondent 5: ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" – different session.
- Respondent 14: ""IV-Hypoglycemia"" – IV but different topic.
- Respondent 22: ""IV (VT)"" – This is IV and VT, but written as ""IV (VT)"". The question is about ""IV - VT"". The hyphen vs. parentheses might be a variation. But the session name here is ""IV (VT)"", so maybe not exactly the same. Need to check if the question considers different formatting as the same session.
- Respondent 3: ""III-Sepsis"" – different.
- Respondent 16: ""I - MI"" – different.
- Respondent 9: ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"" – different.
- Respondent 11: ""IV (AF)"" – IV but different topic.
- Respondent 10: ""(MI)-VT"" – MI and VT, but not IV.
- Respondent 12: ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" – different.
- Respondent 7: ""III-Sepsis"" – different.
- Respondent 18: ""IV - VT"" – Here, the SessionName is exactly ""IV - VT"". So this is a match.

Wait, the question is asking for 'IV - VT' with a space around the hyphen. Respondent 18's SessionName is ""IV - VT"", which matches exactly. Respondent 22's is ""IV (VT)"", which is IV but with VT in parentheses. The question specifies 'IV - VT', so only Respondent 18 matches. 

So the count is 1. But wait, let me check again. Are there any other respondents with SessionName that could be considered 'IV - VT' even if written differently? For example, Respondent 22's ""IV (VT)"" – if the session is considered the same regardless of parentheses or hyphen usage, but the question specifically says 'IV - VT'. The example given in the problem had a session ""I - MI"" and the answer was 1 (Respondent 16). Similarly, in the data, Respondent 10 has ""(MI)-VT"" which wasn't counted as ""I - MI"". So the exact formatting matters. Therefore, only Respondent 18 has ""IV - VT"" exactly. So the answer is 1.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
How many respondents who scored 2 on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' also have 'Comments' that contain the word 'reflected'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find out how many respondents scored 2 on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and also have 'Comments' that include the word 'reflected'. 

First, I need to go through each respondent's data. Let's start by looking at the 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' field for each. The question specifies that we need respondents who scored exactly 2 here. 

Looking at the responses:

- Respondent 9: Recommendation (clear recommendation) is 3. So, no.
- Respondent 7: Scored 2 here. Now check the Comments. Their comment is ""Time: (1:00-1:17)"". No mention of 'reflected'.
- Respondent 4: Scored 2. Comments mention ""Clinical handover..."", ""No panic..."", ""Satisfactory"". No 'reflected'.
- Respondent 15: Scored 2. Comments: ""Detailed Response - clear communication"". No 'reflected'.
- Respondent 3: Scored 3. Not applicable.
- Respondent 22: Scored 2. Comments: ""Clear communication skills Good"". No 'reflected'.
- Respondent 1: Scored 2. Comments: ""Satisfactory"". No.
- Respondent 2: Scored 2. Comments are empty. So no.
- Respondent 13: Scored 2. Comments mention ""Ventricular fibrillation..."" and ""Lack of communication..."". No 'reflected'.
- Respondent 6: Scored 2. Comments are empty. No.
- Respondent 21: Scored 3. Not applicable.

Now, among those who scored 2, check if their Comments contain 'reflected'. The only one with 'reflected' in comments is Respondent 9, but they scored 3, so they don't qualify. Wait, no. Wait, Respondent 9's comment is ""Overall a bit unclear communication reflected"". But their Recommendation (clear recommendation) is 3, so they don't meet the first condition. 

Wait, let me double-check. The task is respondents who scored 2 on Recommendation (clear recommendation) AND have 'reflected' in Comments. So among all respondents with score 2, check their comments. 

Looking again at the list of respondents with score 2: 7,4,15,22,1,2,13,6. Wait, wait, let me list them properly:

Respondent 7: 2
Respondent 4: 2
Respondent 15: 2
Respondent 22: 2
Respondent 1: 2
Respondent 2: 2
Respondent 13: 2
Respondent 6: 2

Wait, no. Wait, looking back:

Respondent 7: 2
Respondent 4: 2
Respondent 15: 2
Respondent 22: 2
Respondent 1: 2
Respondent 2: 2
Respondent 13: 2
Respondent 6: 2

Wait, but looking at the data:

Respondent 9: 3
Respondent 7: 2
Respondent 4: 2
Respondent 15: 2
Respondent 3: 3
Respondent 22: 2
Respondent 1: 2
Respondent 2: 2
Respondent 13: 2
Respondent 6: 2
Respondent 21: 3

So total of 8 respondents with score 2. Now, check each of their comments for the word 'reflected'.

Respondent 7: Comments: ""Time: (1:00-1:17)"" – no.
Respondent 4: Comments: ""Clinical handover..."", ""No panic..."", ""Satisfactory"" – no.
Respondent 15: ""Detailed Response - clear communication"" – no.
Respondent 22: ""Clear communication skills Good"" – no.
Respondent 1: ""Satisfactory"" – no.
Respondent 2: Comments empty – no.
Respondent 13: Comments mention ""Ventricular fibrillation..."", ""Lack of communication..."" – no.
Respondent 6: Comments empty – no.

Wait, but wait, the example in the initial data had Respondent 9 with Comments: ""Overall a bit unclear communication reflected"". But Respondent 9's Recommendation (clear recommendation) is 3, so they don't count. So none of the respondents with score 2 have 'reflected' in their comments. Therefore, the answer should be 0.

</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the number of respondents whose total score for 'Background (examination)' and 'Assessment' is greater than 5. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The 'Questions' section defines each field. 'Background (examination)' is question 6, and 'Assessment' is question 7. Both are scored on a rubric from 0 to 3.

Looking at the 'Responses' section, each respondent has values for these two questions. I need to sum the scores of these two fields for each respondent and check if the sum exceeds 5.

Let's go through each respondent one by one:

- **Respondent 19**: Background (examination) = 3, Assessment = 2. Sum is 3+2=5. Not greater than 5. Exclude.
- **Respondent 7**: Background (examination) = 3, Assessment = 2. Sum is 5. Exclude.
- **Respondent 3**: Background (examination) = 3, Assessment = 3. Sum is 6. Include.
- **Respondent 18**: Background (examination) = 2, Assessment = 3. Sum is 5. Exclude.
- **Respondent 22**: Background (examination) = 3, Assessment = 2. Sum is 5. Exclude.
- **Respondent 23**: Background (examination) = 2, Assessment = 3. Sum is 5. Exclude.
- **Respondent 8**: Background (examination) = 2, Assessment = 2. Sum is 4. Exclude.

Only Respondent 3 has a total of 6, which is greater than 5. So the count is 1.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents from the 'II (Anaphylaxsis)' session scored 3 on 'Situation' and 2 on 'Assessment'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find out how many respondents from the 'II (Anaphylaxsis)' session scored 3 on 'Situation' and 2 on 'Assessment'. 

First, I need to go through each respondent's data and check their SessionName, Situation score, and Assessment score. Let's start by listing all the respondents and their relevant details.

Looking at the data:

- **Respondent 5**: SessionName is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"". Situation is 3, Assessment is 3. So, Situation is good, but Assessment is 3, which doesn't meet the required 2. So this one doesn't count.

- **Respondent 20**: SessionName is ""IV (VT)"". Not the session we're looking for. Skip.

- **Respondent 1**: SessionName is ""V (Hypoglycemia)"". Not relevant. Skip.

- **Respondent 9**: SessionName is ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"". Situation is 3, Assessment is 2. This matches both criteria. So count this one.

- **Respondent 23**: SessionName is ""II-Anaphylaxsis"". Situation is 3, Assessment is 3. Assessment is 3, so doesn't meet the 2 requirement. Exclude.

- **Respondent 19**: SessionName is ""I - MI"". Not the right session. Skip.

- **Respondent 22**: SessionName is ""IV (VT)"". Not relevant. Skip.

- **Respondent 6**: SessionName is ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"". The name is slightly different, using ""Anaphylactic Shock"" instead of ""Anaphylaxsis"". The question specifies ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"", so this might be a different session. But maybe it's a typo? Wait, the original data has ""Anaphylaxsis"" in some and ""Anaphylactic Shock"" here. Since the question specifically asks for ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"", Respondent 6's session is named differently, so we shouldn't count it. 

- **Respondent 2**: SessionName is ""MI"". Not relevant. Skip.

- **Respondent 11**: SessionName is ""IV (AF)"". Not relevant. Skip.

So, the only respondent that matches is Respondent 9. But wait, let me double-check. Are there any other respondents with SessionName variations of ""II (Anaphylaxsis)""? Respondent 5 has ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" with a hyphen instead of parentheses. Respondent 23 has ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" with a hyphen. The question specifies ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"" with parentheses. Should these variations be considered the same session? The example given in the data shows that ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" and ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"" are treated as the same, but the example answer was 2 for a similar question. Wait, in the example, the answer was 2 for 'I - MI' session. Looking at the example data, Respondent 19 has ""I - MI"" and Respondent 2 has ""MI"". The answer was 2, which suggests that both ""I - MI"" and ""MI"" are considered part of the same session. But in the example, the answer was 2, but looking at the example data, only Respondent 19 and Respondent 2 have MI-related sessions. Wait, in the example, the answer was 2, but in the example data, Respondent 19 is ""I - MI"" and Respondent 2 is ""MI"". So maybe the session name is considered the same if it contains ""MI"" regardless of the prefix. But in the current task, the session name is ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"", so we need to check if variations like ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" or ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" are considered the same. 

But the question specifically asks for ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"", so perhaps only the exact match. However, in the example, the answer included both ""I - MI"" and ""MI"" as part of the same session. So maybe the session name is considered the same if the main part matches, regardless of formatting. For example, ""II - Anaphylaxsis"", ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"", and ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" might all be considered the same session. If that's the case, then we need to check all variations of ""II"" followed by Anaphylaxsis. 

So, let's re-examine:

- Respondent 5: II - Anaphylaxsis. Situation 3, Assessment 3. Doesn't meet Assessment 2.

- Respondent 9: II (Anaphylaxsis). Situation 3, Assessment 2. Meets.

- Respondent 23: II-Anaphylaxsis. Situation 3, Assessment 3. Doesn't meet.

- Respondent 6: II (Anaphylactic Shock). Different session name, even though Anaphylactic Shock is similar to Anaphylaxsis (maybe a typo?), but the question specifies Anaphylaxsis. So exclude.

So, only Respondent 9 meets the exact criteria if we consider exact session name. But if variations in formatting (like hyphens vs parentheses) are considered the same session, then we need to check. However, the example in the problem shows that ""I - MI"" and ""MI"" are considered the same. Wait, in the example, the answer was 2 for the 'I - MI' session. Looking at the example data, Respondent 19 has ""I - MI"" and Respondent 2 has ""MI"". The answer was 2, which suggests that both are counted. But in the example's data, Respondent 2's SessionName is ""MI"", and the answer was 2. Wait, the example's answer is 2, but in the example data, there are two respondents with SessionName related to MI: Respondent 19 (I - MI) and Respondent 2 (MI). So the answer is 2, which implies that both are counted. Therefore, session names that include the key term (like ""MI"") regardless of the prefix or formatting are considered part of the same session. 

Applying that logic to the current task: the session name is ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"". So any session that includes ""II"" and ""Anaphylaxsis"" in the name would count. So Respondent 5 (II - Anaphylaxsis), Respondent 9 (II (Anaphylaxsis)), and Respondent 23 (II-Anaphylaxsis) would all be considered part of the same session. 

Now, check their Situation and Assessment scores:

- Respondent 5: Situation 3, Assessment 3. So Assessment is 3, which doesn't meet the required 2. Exclude.

- Respondent 9: Situation 3, Assessment 2. Meets both criteria. Count.

- Respondent 23: Situation 3, Assessment 3. Exclude.

So only Respondent 9. But wait, the example's answer was 2, which included two respondents. So perhaps in the example, the SessionName ""MI"" and ""I - MI"" are considered the same. So maybe the key is the part after the session number. For example, ""I - MI"" and ""MI"" both have ""MI"" as the main session name. Similarly, in the current task, the main session name is ""Anaphylaxsis"", so any session that includes ""Anaphylaxsis"" in the name, regardless of the prefix (like II -, II (, etc.), would be considered part of the same session. 

But the current task specifies ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"", so perhaps the session number is important. So ""II"" followed by Anaphylaxsis. So sessions like ""II - Anaphylaxsis"", ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"", ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" would all be considered ""II"" sessions. So in that case, the three respondents (5,9,23) are part of the II session. Now check their scores:

- Respondent 5: Situation 3, Assessment 3. Doesn't meet.

- Respondent 9: Situation 3, Assessment 2. Meets.

- Respondent 23: Situation 3, Assessment 3. Doesn't meet.

So only Respondent 9. But wait, the example's answer was 2, which included two respondents. Let me check the example again. In the example, the question was ""How many respondents participated in a 'I - MI' session?"" The answer was 2. Looking at the example data, Respondent 19 has ""I - MI"" and Respondent 2 has ""MI"". So the answer counts both, even though the session names are different. Therefore, the session name matching is case-insensitive and considers variations. So in the current task, any session that includes ""Anaphylaxsis"" and the session number ""II"" in any format would be considered. 

Wait, but the example's answer included ""I - MI"" and ""MI"" as the same session. So perhaps the session name is considered the same if the main part (after the session number) matches. So for the current task, ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"" would include any session where the main name is Anaphylaxsis and the session is II. So ""II - Anaphylaxsis"", ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"", ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" are all part of the same session. Therefore, we need to check all three respondents (5,9,23) for their scores.

Looking again:

- Respondent 5: SessionName ""II - Anaphylaxsis"". Situation 3, Assessment 3. Doesn't meet.

- Respondent 9: SessionName ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"". Situation 3, Assessment 2. Meets.

- Respondent 23: SessionName ""II-Anaphylaxsis"". Situation 3, Assessment 3. Doesn't meet.

So only Respondent 9. Therefore, the answer should be 1. But wait, the example's answer was 2, which included two respondents. Let me check if there's another respondent I missed. 

Wait, Respondent 6's SessionName is ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"". That's a different condition, so not part of Anaphylaxsis. So no. 

Therefore, the correct answer is 1. But wait, let me check again. The question is asking for the session named 'II (Anaphylaxsis)'. If the session name must exactly match that, then only Respondent 9. If variations are allowed, then maybe others. But according to the example, variations in the session name (like ""I - MI"" and ""MI"") are considered the same. So in this case, ""II - Anaphylaxsis"", ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"", and ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" would all be considered the same session. But in the example, ""I - MI"" and ""MI"" are considered the same. So perhaps the session number is part of the name. Wait, in the example, the session name is ""I - MI"" and ""MI"". The answer counts both, implying that the session number is not considered. Wait, that's confusing. Maybe the session name is considered as the main part after the number. For example, ""I - MI"" and ""MI"" both have ""MI"" as the main name, so they are grouped together. Similarly, in the current task, the main name is ""Anaphylaxsis"", so any session with that name, regardless of the session number, would be considered. But the question specifies ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"", so the session number is part of the name. Therefore, only sessions that have ""II"" in their name along with ""Anaphylaxsis"" would count. 

In that case, the three respondents (5,9,23) are part of the II session. Now, checking their scores:

- Respondent 5: Situation 3, Assessment 3. Doesn't meet.

- Respondent 9: Situation 3, Assessment 2. Meets.

- Respondent 23: Situation 3, Assessment 3. Doesn't meet.

So only one respondent. Therefore, the answer is 1. But wait, the example's answer was 2, which included two respondents. Let me check the example again. In the example, the question was about 'I - MI' session. The data had Respondent 19 with 'I - MI' and Respondent 2 with 'MI'. The answer was 2. So even though the session names are different, they were counted. Therefore, the session name matching is not exact. So in the current task, if the session name includes ""Anaphylaxsis"" and the session number is ""II"", regardless of formatting, then all three respondents (5,9,23) are part of the session. But their scores:

- Respondent 5: Situation 3, Assessment 3. Doesn't meet.

- Respondent 9: Situation 3, Assessment 2. Meets.

- Respondent 23: Situation 3, Assessment 3. Doesn't meet.

So only one. Therefore, the answer is 1. But maybe I'm missing something. Let me check all respondents again.

Wait, Respondent 6's SessionName is ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"". That's a different condition. So no. 

So the final answer is 1. But wait, the example's answer was 2, which included two respondents. Let me check the example again. In the example, the question was ""How many respondents participated in a 'I - MI' session?"" The answer was 2. Looking at the data, Respondent 19 has ""I - MI"" and Respondent 2 has ""MI"". So the answer counts both. Therefore, the session name is considered to be the part after the session number, and variations in the session number's formatting (like ""I - MI"" vs ""MI"") are considered the same. Wait, but in that case, the session number is part of the name. So ""I - MI"" includes the session number ""I"", while ""MI"" doesn't have a session number. But the example answer counts both. That's confusing. Maybe the session number is not considered, and the main name is the key. So ""I - MI"" and ""MI"" are considered the same session. If that's the case, then in the current task, any session with ""Anaphylaxsis"" in the name, regardless of the session number, would be considered. But the question specifies ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"", so the session number is part of the name. Therefore, the session number must be ""II"". 

Alternatively, maybe the session number is part of the name, so ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"" is a specific session, and variations like ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" are the same. Therefore, in the current task, the three respondents (5,9,23) are part of the same session. But their scores:

- Respondent 5: Situation 3, Assessment 3. Doesn't meet.

- Respondent 9: Situation 3, Assessment 2. Meets.

- Respondent 23: Situation 3, Assessment 3. Doesn't meet.

So only one. Therefore, the answer is 1. But I need to make sure I didn't miss any other respondents. Let me list all respondents again:

Respondent 5: II - Anaphylaxsis

Respondent 9: II (Anaphylaxsis)

Respondent 23: II-Anaphylaxsis

Respondent 6: II (Anaphylactic Shock)

Others are different sessions.

So, only the first three are part of the II Anaphylaxsis sessions. Of those, only Respondent 9 has Situation 3 and Assessment 2. So the answer is 1.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and 'Situation' is greater than 5.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the number of respondents whose total score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and 'Situation' is greater than 5. 

First, I need to make sure I understand the data structure. The questions section defines each field, and the responses are from different respondents. The key fields here are 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and 'Situation'. 

Looking at the questions, 'Situation' is question 4, and its rubric goes from 0 to 3. Similarly, 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' is question 8, also with a rubric from 0 to 3. The task is to sum these two scores for each respondent and count how many have a sum greater than 5.

Now, let's go through each respondent's data:

**Respondent 5:**
- Situation: 3
- Recommendation (clear recommendation): 2
- Sum: 3 + 2 = 5 → Not greater than 5.

**Respondent 1:**
- Situation: 2
- Recommendation (clear recommendation): 2
- Sum: 2 + 2 = 4 → Not greater than 5.

**Respondent 12:**
- Situation: 3
- Recommendation (clear recommendation): 3
- Sum: 3 + 3 = 6 → Greater than 5. Count this one.

**Respondent 8:**
- Situation: 3
- Recommendation (clear recommendation): 2
- Sum: 3 + 2 = 5 → Not greater than 5.

**Respondent 19:**
- Situation: 3
- Recommendation (clear recommendation): 3
- Sum: 3 + 3 = 6 → Greater than 5. Count this one.

So, out of the five respondents, two (Respondent 12 and 19) have a total score greater than 5. Therefore, the answer should be 2.

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
How many respondents from the 'II (Anaphylactic Shock)' session scored 3 on 'Background (examination)' and 2 on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find out how many respondents from the 'II (Anaphylactic Shock)' session scored 3 on 'Background (examination)' and 2 on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)'. 

First, I need to go through each respondent's data and check if they meet all three criteria: their SessionName is 'II (Anaphylactic Shock)', their Background (examination) score is 3, and their Recommendation (clear recommendation) score is 2.

Looking at the data:

- **Respondent 1**: SessionName is 'V (Hypoglycemia)' – doesn't match. Skip.
- **Respondent 6**: SessionName is 'II (Anaphylactic Shock)'. Check scores: Background (examination) is 3, Recommendation (clear recommendation) is 2. This one meets the criteria.
- **Respondent 9**: SessionName is 'II (Anaphylaxsis)' – note the spelling difference. The question specifies 'Anaphylactic Shock', so this might be a typo but it's a different session name. So, doesn't match.
- **Respondent 2**: SessionName is 'MI' – nope.
- **Respondent 5**: SessionName is 'II - Anaphylaxsis' – again, different spelling. Not matching.
- **Respondent 14**: SessionName is 'IV-Hypoglycemia' – no.
- **Respondent 17**: SessionName is 'V (Hypoglycemia)' – no.
- **Respondent 4**: SessionName is 'III (Sepsis)' – no.
- **Respondent 12**: SessionName is 'II (Anaphylaxis)' – 'Anaphylaxis' vs. 'Anaphylactic Shock' – different names. So, not a match.
- **Respondent 20**: SessionName is 'IV (VT)' – no.

Only Respondent 6 fits all the conditions. So the count should be 1.

</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking: How many respondents who scored 2 on 'Background (examination)' also have 'Comments' that contain the word 'communication'?

First, I need to go through each respondent in the data and check two things: their score on 'Background (examination)' and whether their 'Comments' include the word 'communication'. 

Starting with the list of respondents:

- **Respondent 15**: Background (examination) is 3. So, doesn't meet the score of 2. Skip.
- **Respondent 12**: Background (examination) is 3. Skip.
- **Respondent 17**: Score 3. Skip.
- **Respondent 19**: Score 3. Skip.
- **Respondent 4**: Background (examination) is 2. Now check Comments: ""Clinical handover and communication skills, satisfactory"" and ""No panic, no arrest team"". The word 'communication' is present. So this counts.
- **Respondent 23**: Score 2 on Background (examination). Comments mention ""Talking to registrav could not summarize the condition of patient very clearly"" and ""DID: Sepsis I Anaphylaxsis given by team"". No 'communication' here. So doesn't count.
- **Respondent 21**: Background (examination) is 1. Skip.
- **Respondent 8**: Background (examination) is 2. Comments: ""Clear communication during handover"" and ""Good"". 'Communication' is present. So this counts.
- **Respondent 10**: Score 2. Comments: ""Time: (15:53-16:14)"". No mention of communication. Skip.
- **Respondent 1**: Score 2. Comments: ""Satisfactory"". No 'communication'. Skip.
- **Respondent 22**: Score 3. Skip.

So, the respondents with Background (examination) score 2 are Respondent 4, 23, 8, 10, 1. Wait, wait. Let me check again. 

Wait, looking back:

Respondent 4: 2 (yes)
Respondent 23: 2 (yes)
Respondent 8: 2 (yes)
Respondent 10: 2 (yes)
Respondent 1: 2 (yes?)

Wait, no. Wait, let me recheck each:

Looking at each respondent's Background (examination):

- Respondent 15: 3
- 12:3
- 17:3
- 19:3
- 4:2
- 23:2 (from the data, yes: Background (examination): 2)
- 21:1
- 8:2
- 10:2 (Background (examination): 2)
- 1:2 (Background (examination): 2)
- 22:3

Wait, so the respondents with Background (examination) score 2 are 4, 23, 8, 10, 1. Wait, but in the data:

Looking at Respondent 1: Background (examination): 2. Yes. So that's five respondents. But wait, the original example answer was 2, but that was for a different question. Let's focus on the current task.

Now, among these, check if their Comments include 'communication':

- Respondent 4: Comments include 'communication' (yes)
- Respondent 23: Comments do not have 'communication' (no)
- Respondent 8: Comments have 'communication' (yes)
- Respondent 10: No 'communication' in comments
- Respondent 1: No 'communication' in comments

So, only respondents 4 and 8 meet both criteria. Therefore, the answer should be 2.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents who scored 3 on 'Background (examination)' also have 'Comments' that contain the word 'reflected'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking for the number of respondents who scored 3 on 'Background (examination)' and also have 'Comments' that include the word 'reflected'. 

First, I need to go through each respondent's data in the provided survey responses. For each respondent, I'll check two things: their score on the 'Background (examination)' question and whether their 'Comments' section contains the word 'reflected'.

Starting with Respondent 10: Their Background (examination) score is 2, which doesn't meet the 3 requirement. The comments don't mention 'reflected', so they're out.

Respondent 15 has a Background (examination) score of 3. Let me check their comments: ""Detailed Response - clear communication"". No 'reflected' here, so not counted.

Respondent 21's Background (examination) is 1. Doesn't qualify.

Respondent 1: Background (examination) is 2. Skip.

Respondent 2: Background (examination) is 3. Their comments are empty, so no 'reflected' here.

Respondent 16: Background (examination) is 3. Comments are ""Consent denied for video recordings"" and ""Satisfactory"". No 'reflected'.

Respondent 13: Background (examination) is 1. Not applicable.

Respondent 14: Score 2. Skip.

Respondent 11: Background (examination) is 3. Comments: ""Clear communication and handover"". No 'reflected'.

Respondent 19: Background (examination) is 3. Comments mention ""Wrong CPR position"", ""Clarity is a bit low..."", and ""Satisfactory"". Still no 'reflected'.

Respondent 8: Score 2. Not relevant.

Respondent 12: Background (examination) is 3. Comments: ""Good"". No 'reflected' here either.

After checking all respondents, none of those who scored 3 on Background (examination) have comments containing 'reflected'. So the count should be zero.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and 'Background (history)' is greater than 5.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. The question is asking to count the number of respondents whose total score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and 'Background (history)' is greater than 5. 

First, I need to make sure I understand the data structure. The 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and 'Background (history)' are two separate questions in the survey. Each has a rubric with scores from 0 to 3. The task is to add the scores for these two questions for each respondent and count how many have a sum greater than 5.

Looking at the data provided, each respondent has entries for these two fields. Let's go through each respondent one by one.

Starting with Respondent 3:
- Background (history): 3
- Recommendation (clear recommendation): 3
Sum: 3 + 3 = 6. 6 is greater than 5, so this counts.

Respondent 23:
- Background (history): 2
- Recommendation (clear recommendation): 3
Sum: 2 + 3 = 5. 5 is not greater than 5, so exclude.

Respondent 11:
- Background (history): 3
- Recommendation (clear recommendation): 3
Sum: 6. Include.

Respondent 20:
- Background (history): 2
- Recommendation (clear recommendation): 2
Sum: 4. Exclude.

Respondent 5:
- Background (history): 3
- Recommendation (clear recommendation): 2
Sum: 5. Exclude.

Respondent 22:
- Background (history): 3
- Recommendation (clear recommendation): 2
Sum: 5. Exclude.

Respondent 19:
- Background (history): 3
- Recommendation (clear recommendation): 3
Sum: 6. Include.

Respondent 9:
- Background (history): 2
- Recommendation (clear recommendation): 3
Sum: 5. Exclude.

Respondent 10:
- Background (history): 2
- Recommendation (clear recommendation): 2
Sum: 4. Exclude.

Respondent 21:
- Background (history): 3
- Recommendation (clear recommendation): 3
Sum: 6. Include.

Respondent 15:
- Background (history): 2
- Recommendation (clear recommendation): 2
Sum: 4. Exclude.

Now, tallying up the respondents who meet the criteria: Respondents 3, 11, 19, 21. That's a total of 4.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents from the '(MI)-VT' session scored 2 on 'Assessment' and 2 on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find out how many respondents from the '(MI)-VT' session scored 2 on 'Assessment' and 2 on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)'. 

First, I need to look through all the respondents and check their SessionName. The target session is '(MI)-VT'. Let me go through each respondent one by one.

Starting with Respondent 23: SessionName is II-Anaphylaxsis. Not the one we need. Next, Respondent 11: IV (AF). Nope. Respondent 13: I-VF. Not matching. Respondent 20: IV (VT). Still not. Respondent 17: V (Hypoglycemia). No. Respondent 10: SessionName is (MI)-VT. That's a match. Now check their Assessment and Recommendation (clear recommendation). Assessment is 2, Recommendation (clear recommendation) is 2. So this respondent meets the criteria.

Moving on. Respondent 15: III - Sepsis. Not relevant. Respondent 14: IV-Hypoglycemia. No. Respondent 2: MI. The SessionName here is just MI, not (MI)-VT, so that's different. Respondent 21: I (Myocardial infarction). Not the same. Respondent 12: II (Anaphylaxis). No. Respondent 19: I - MI. Again, different session name.

So only Respondent 10 is in the '(MI)-VT' session and has both Assessment 2 and Recommendation (clear recommendation) 2. Therefore, the count is 1.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

How many respondents from the 'I-VF' session scored 2 on 'Assessment' and 3 on 'Situation'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find out how many respondents from the 'I-VF' session scored 2 on 'Assessment' and 3 on 'Situation'. 

First, I need to look through all the respondents and check their SessionName. The session in question is 'I-VF'. Let me go through each respondent one by one.

Starting with Respondent 7: SessionName is III-Sepsis. Not I-VF. Skip.

Respondent 14: IV-Hypoglycemia. Not relevant.

Respondent 15: III - Sepsis. Nope.

Respondent 8: III (Sepsis). Still not.

Respondent 22: IV (VT). No.

Respondent 11: IV (AF). Not matching.

Respondent 21: I (Myocardial infarction). Different session.

Respondent 13: SessionName is I-VF. Okay, this is the one. Now check their scores. Situation is 3, Assessment is 2. So that's a match. So count 1 so far.

Respondent 23: II-Anaphylaxsis. Not relevant.

Respondent 12: II (Anaphylaxis). No.

Respondent 2: MI. Not I-VF.

Respondent 6: II (Anaphylactic Shock). Not applicable.

So only Respondent 13 is in the I-VF session. Their Situation score is 3 and Assessment is 2. Therefore, the answer should be 1.

How many respondents who scored 2 on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' also have 'Comments' that contain the word 'unclear'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find out how many respondents scored a 2 on the 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and also have 'Comments' that include the word 'unclear'. 

First, I need to go through each respondent's data. Let me start by looking at the 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' for each one. The rubric for this question says that a score of 2 means ""Confident but required some further questioning"".

Looking at the responses:

- Respondent 11: GRS is 3. Doesn't meet the score 2.
- Respondent 22: GRS is 3. Nope.
- Respondent 9: GRS is 2. Okay, this one qualifies. Now check the comments: ""Overall a bit unclear communication reflected"". The word 'unclear' is there. So this counts.
- Respondent 12: GRS is 3. Skip.
- Respondent 5: GRS is 3. No.
- Respondent 16: GRS is 3. No.
- Respondent 3: GRS is 3. No.
- Respondent 17: GRS is 2. Check comments: ""Concise - clear"". No 'unclear' here.
- Respondent 14: GRS is 2. Comments mention ""Late response for considering consultation"". No 'unclear'.
- Respondent 2: GRS is 1. Doesn't qualify.
- Respondent 15: GRS is 2. Comments: ""Detailed Response - clear communication"". 'Clear' is there, but not 'unclear'.

So, only Respondent 9 has a GRS of 2 and comments with 'unclear'. Therefore, the count is 1.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents from the 'IV - VT' session scored 2 on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 3 on 'Situation'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find out how many respondents from the 'IV - VT' session scored 2 on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 3 on 'Situation'. 

First, I need to go through each respondent in the data and check two things: their SessionName and their scores on the two specified questions. 

Starting with the SessionName. The question specifies 'IV - VT'. Looking at the responses, I need to find all respondents where the SessionName exactly matches 'IV - VT' or any variations that might be considered the same. For example, sometimes there might be parentheses instead of dashes, or extra spaces. Let me check each respondent's SessionName:

- Respondent 4: III (Sepsis) – Not IV - VT.
- Respondent 12: II (Anaphylaxis) – No.
- Respondent 5: II - Anaphylaxsis – No.
- Respondent 18: IV - VT – This matches exactly. So Respondent 18 is a candidate.
- Respondent 2: MI – No.
- Respondent 20: IV (VT) – Hmm, this is written as IV (VT). The question is about 'IV - VT', but VT here is in parentheses. Since VT is the same condition, maybe this is considered the same session but written differently. So Respondent 20 might be part of the same session. The question is whether the SessionName 'IV (VT)' is equivalent to 'IV - VT'. The original example in the data shows that SessionName can have variations like ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" vs ""II (Anaphylaxis)"", so perhaps the format (dash vs parentheses) doesn't change the session name. Therefore, Respondent 20's session is IV (VT), which is likely the same as IV - VT. So both Respondent 18 and 20 are in the IV - VT session.

Wait, but the task says 'IV - VT' specifically. Let me check the exact SessionNames. Respondent 18's SessionName is ""IV - VT"" with a dash, and Respondent 20's is ""IV (VT)"" with parentheses. Are these considered the same? The example given in the data shows that ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" and ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" are treated as the same session (like Respondent 5 and 12). So perhaps the session name is considered the same if the main identifier (IV and VT) matches, regardless of the punctuation. Therefore, both Respondent 18 and 20 are part of the IV - VT session. 

But wait, the original example in the data had a question about 'I - MI' session, and the answer was 2. Looking at the example data, Respondent 2's SessionName is ""MI"", and that's the only one. But the answer was 2, which suggests that maybe the session names are case-insensitive or abbreviations. Wait, in the example, the answer was 2, but in the data provided, only Respondent 2 has SessionName ""MI"". However, the example's answer is 2, which might be a mistake, but perhaps in the actual data here, the same logic applies. So maybe the session name can be written in different formats but refers to the same session. So for the current task, 'IV - VT' would include both ""IV - VT"" and ""IV (VT)"".

So proceeding under that assumption, both Respondent 18 and 20 are in the IV - VT session.

Now, for each of these respondents, check their scores on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 'Situation'.

First, Respondent 18:
- Situation: 3
- Recommendation (global rating scale): 2
So this meets the criteria (Situation 3 and GRS 2).

Respondent 20:
- Situation: 3
- Recommendation (global rating scale): 3
Here, GRS is 3, which doesn't meet the requirement of 2. So only Respondent 18 qualifies.

Wait, but the task is to count respondents from 'IV - VT' session who scored 2 on GRS and 3 on Situation. So Respondent 18 is the only one. But wait, let me check again.

Wait, Respondent 20's SessionName is ""IV (VT)"", which we considered as part of IV - VT. But their GRS is 3, so they don't meet the GRS=2 condition. Therefore, only Respondent 18 meets both criteria.

But wait, let me check all other respondents again to make sure I didn't miss any. Let's go through each one:

Respondent 4: Session III (Sepsis) – Not IV - VT.

Respondent 12: II (Anaphylaxis) – No.

Respondent 5: II - Anaphylaxsis – No.

Respondent 18: IV - VT – Yes. Situation 3, GRS 2. Count 1.

Respondent 2: MI – No.

Respondent 20: IV (VT) – Session considered as IV - VT. Situation 3, GRS 3. Doesn't meet GRS=2. So no.

Respondent 11: IV (AF) – Different session.

Respondent 23: II-Anaphylaxsis – No.

Respondent 7: III-Sepsis – No.

Respondent 6: II (Anaphylactic Shock) – No.

Respondent 17: V (Hypoglycemia) – No.

So only Respondent 18 meets both conditions. Therefore, the answer should be 1.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 'Assessment' is greater than 5.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this task. The question is asking to count the number of respondents whose total score for 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 'Assessment' is greater than 5. 

First, I need to make sure I understand the data structure. The 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is question 9, and 'Assessment' is question 7. Both are scored on a rubric from 0 to 3. So the maximum possible total for these two would be 6 (3+3). The task is to find respondents where the sum of these two scores is greater than 5. That means their total has to be 6, since 5.5 isn't possible here.

Now, I'll go through each respondent and check their scores for these two questions.

Starting with Respondent 2: 
- Assessment: 3
- GRS: 1
Total: 4. Not greater than 5.

Respondent 10:
- Assessment: 2
- GRS: 2
Total: 4. No.

Respondent 20:
- Assessment: 3
- GRS: 3
Total: 6. This one counts.

Respondent 22:
- Assessment: 2
- GRS: 3
Total: 5. Not enough.

Respondent 12:
- Assessment: 2
- GRS: 3
Total: 5. No.

Respondent 4:
- Assessment: 2
- GRS: 2
Total: 4. No.

Respondent 17:
- Assessment: 3
- GRS: 2
Total: 5. No.

Respondent 7:
- Assessment: 2
- GRS: 2
Total: 4. No.

Respondent 3:
- Assessment: 3
- GRS: 3
Total: 6. This counts.

Respondent 11:
- Assessment: 3
- GRS: 3
Total: 6. Another one.

Respondent 8:
- Assessment: 2
- GRS: 3
Total: 5. No.

So, the respondents with totals over 5 are 20, 3, and 11. That's three respondents. Wait, let me double-check each:

Respondent 20: 3+3=6 ✅
Respondent 3: 3+3=6 ✅
Respondent 11: 3+3=6 ✅

Yes, three respondents. So the answer should be 3.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents from the 'II (Anaphylaxis)' session scored 3 on 'Background (examination)' and 3 on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find out how many respondents from the 'II (Anaphylaxis)' session scored 3 on both 'Background (examination)' and 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)'. 

First, I need to identify all respondents who participated in the session named 'II (Anaphylaxis)'. Let me go through each respondent's data.

Looking at Respondent 12: Their SessionName is ""II (Anaphylaxis)"". So that's one. Then Respondent 23's SessionName is ""II-Anaphylaxsis"". Hmm, the spelling is slightly different here—""Anaphylaxsis"" instead of ""Anaphylaxis"". But maybe that's a typo and they're referring to the same session. Similarly, Respondent 9 has ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"". The question uses ""II (Anaphylaxis)"", so I need to check if these are considered the same. Since the session names are case-insensitive and variations in spacing or hyphens might be acceptable, but the spelling difference between ""Anaphylaxis"" and ""Anaphylaxsis"" could be a mistake. However, given that the example in the data shows both ""Anaphylaxis"" and ""Anaphylaxsis"", perhaps they are different sessions. Wait, but the task specifically mentions 'II (Anaphylaxis)', so maybe only Respondent 12 and Respondent 9 (if their session is considered the same) qualify. Wait, no—Respondent 9's SessionName is ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"", which might be a typo. Alternatively, maybe it's a different session. The original question is about 'II (Anaphylaxis)', so I should only count exact matches. But the example in the data shows that in the answer, the session ""I - MI"" had 1 respondent (Respondent 16), and the example answer was 2. Wait, no, the example's answer was 2, but in the data provided in the example, only Respondent 16 had SessionName ""I - MI"". Wait, maybe the example had a different dataset. But in the current task's data, let's focus on the exact SessionName as per the question.

So, the question is about 'II (Anaphylaxis)'. Let's check each respondent:

- Respondent 12: SessionName is ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" → matches.
- Respondent 23: SessionName is ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" → different spelling, possibly a typo, but not exact.
- Respondent 9: SessionName is ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"" → again, the spelling is different. So unless ""Anaphylaxsis"" is a typo for ""Anaphylaxis"", these are different. But since the question specifies ""Anaphylaxis"", I should only consider exact matches. So only Respondent 12.

Wait, but maybe the hyphen vs parentheses don't matter. For example, in the example, the SessionName ""I - MI"" was considered, and the answer was 2, but in the data provided, only Respondent 16 had ""I - MI"". Wait, the example's answer was 2, but in the example data, only one respondent (16) had that session. That suggests that maybe there's a mistake in the example, but perhaps in the actual task, we need to be precise. Alternatively, maybe the example's data was different. Let's not get confused by the example. Let's focus on the current task's data.

So, in the current data, the respondents with SessionName exactly 'II (Anaphylaxis)' are:

- Respondent 12: SessionName: II (Anaphylaxis)
- Are there others? Let's check all:

Respondent 4: III (Sepsis)
Respondent 12: II (Anaphylaxis)
Respondent 18: IV - VT
Respondent 22: IV (VT)
Respondent 23: II-Anaphylaxsis
Respondent 9: II (Anaphylaxsis)
Respondent 8: III (Sepsis)
Respondent 14: IV-Hypoglycemia
Respondent 16: I - MI

So only Respondent 12 has the exact ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" session name. The others with similar names are Respondent 23 and 9, but their session names have ""Anaphylaxsis"" with an extra 's', which might be a typo. However, the question is case-sensitive? The output rules say to preserve capitalization, but the session names are case-insensitive? The problem says to refer to the questions schema. The SessionName is an open-ended question, so the exact text matters. Therefore, ""Anaphylaxis"" vs ""Anaphylaxsis"" are different. Therefore, only Respondent 12 is in the 'II (Anaphylaxis)' session.

Now, for Respondent 12, check their scores on 'Background (examination)' and 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)'. 

Looking at Respondent 12's data:
- Background (examination): 3
- Recommendation (clear recommendation): 3

So they meet both criteria. Therefore, count 1.

But wait, are there any other respondents in the 'II (Anaphylaxis)' session? If the session name variations are considered, like ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" or ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"", but the question specifically asks for 'II (Anaphylaxis)', so those would not be included. Therefore, the answer is 1.

Wait, but let me check again. The task says: ""How many respondents from the 'II (Anaphylaxis)' session scored 3 on 'Background (examination)' and 3 on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)'?"" So only Respondent 12 fits. But wait, in the data, Respondent 9's SessionName is ""II (Anaphylaxsis)""—maybe that's a typo. If the user intended to include all variations of Anaphylaxis, but the question is specific. So unless there's another respondent in the exact session name, the answer is 1. But let me check again.

Wait, Respondent 23's SessionName is ""II-Anaphylaxsis"", and Respondent 9's is ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"". Both have ""Anaphylaxsis"" with an extra 's'. So unless that's a typo, they are different sessions. Therefore, only Respondent 12 is in the correct session. So the answer is 1. But wait, in the example given, the answer was 2 for 'I - MI' session, but in the data provided, only Respondent 16 had that session. So perhaps the example had a different dataset. Therefore, in this case, the answer is 1. But I need to make sure.

Alternatively, maybe the session names are case-insensitive and variations in formatting (like hyphens vs parentheses) are ignored. For example, ""II-Anaphylaxis"" vs ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" might be considered the same. But in the data, Respondent 23's SessionName is ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" (with the extra 's'), which is different. So unless that's a typo, it's a different session. Therefore, the answer is 1.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents who scored 3 on 'Background (examination)' also have 'Comments' that contain the word 'unclear'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking how many respondents scored a 3 on 'Background (examination)' and also have 'Comments' that include the word 'unclear'. 

First, I need to go through each respondent's data and check two things: their score on 'Background (examination)' and whether their comments contain 'unclear'. 

Starting with Respondent 20: Their Background (examination) is -1, which isn't 3, so they're out. 

Respondent 23: Background (examination) is 2. Not 3. Skip.

Respondent 21: Background (examination) is 1. Nope.

Respondent 18: Score is 2. Not matching.

Respondent 1: Score is 2. Doesn't qualify.

Respondent 9: Score is 2. Next.

Respondent 19: Here, Background (examination) is 3. Now check the comments. The comments mention ""Clarity is a bit low over whole case scenario"". The word 'unclear' isn't there, but 'clarity is a bit low' might be similar. Wait, the task is to look for the exact word 'unclear'. So this comment doesn't have 'unclear', so this respondent doesn't count.

Respondent 6: Score is 3. Comments are empty. So no 'unclear' here. Doesn't count.

Respondent 5: Score is 3. Comments say ""Good clear and precise clinical handover Good"". No 'unclear' here. So no.

Respondent 12: Score is 3. Comments are ""Good"". No 'unclear'.

Respondent 13: Score is 1. Not applicable.

Respondent 15: Score is 3. Comments: ""Detailed Response - clear communication"". No 'unclear' here.

So, among all respondents, only those with Background (examination) 3 are 19, 6, 5, 12, 15. Now checking their comments for 'unclear':

- Respondent 19: 'unclear' not present.
- Respondent 6: No comments.
- Respondent 5: No 'unclear'.
- Respondent 12: No.
- Respondent 15: No.

Wait, but wait. Let me check again. The question is about 'unclear' in the comments. Let me scan each comment again.

Looking at Respondent 9: Their comment is ""Overall a bit unclear communication reflected"". But their Background (examination) is 2, so they don't qualify. 

Respondent 19's comment has ""Clarity is a bit low"", which is similar but not the exact word 'unclear'. So even though it's a similar meaning, the question specifies the word 'unclear' must be present. So Respondent 19 doesn't count.

So, none of the respondents with Background (examination) 3 have 'unclear' in their comments. Therefore, the answer is 0.

<task>
Count the respondents who participated in a session where the average 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' for that session name is greater than 2.5.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents who participated in a session where the average 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' for that session name is greater than 2.5. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The data provided includes multiple respondents, each with a SessionName and a 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' score. The goal is to group respondents by their SessionName, calculate the average of the global rating scale for each session, and then count how many respondents are in sessions where this average exceeds 2.5.

Let me start by listing all the SessionNames and their corresponding global rating scale values. 

Looking at each respondent:

- Respondent 12: SessionName ""II (Anaphylaxis)"", GRS 3
- Respondent 1: ""V (Hypoglycemia)"", GRS 2
- Respondent 6: ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"", GRS 3
- Respondent 5: ""II - Anaphylaxsis"", GRS 3
- Respondent 19: ""I - MI"", GRS 3
- Respondent 13: ""I-VF"", GRS 2
- Respondent 3: ""III-Sepsis"", GRS 3
- Respondent 20: ""IV (VT)"", GRS 3
- Respondent 23: ""II-Anaphylaxsis"", GRS 3
- Respondent 11: ""IV (AF)"", GRS 3

Now, group these by SessionName. Some SessionNames might be the same but written differently. For example, ""II (Anaphylaxis)"", ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"", ""II - Anaphylaxsis"", and ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" might be variations of the same session. But the problem states that the SessionName is open-ended, so exact matches are necessary unless specified otherwise. Wait, the example given in the initial data shows that ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" and ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" are considered different sessions. For instance, in the example, the answer was 2, which probably refers to two respondents in the ""I - MI"" session. Wait, in the example, the answer was 2, but looking at the example data, there was only one respondent (Respondent 19) with SessionName ""I - MI"". Hmm, maybe the example had a different setup. But in the current task, we need to be precise.

Wait, the current task is different from the example. Let's focus on the current data. Let me list all SessionNames and their GRS:

1. II (Anaphylaxis) - GRS 3 (Respondent 12)
2. V (Hypoglycemia) - GRS 2 (Respondent 1)
3. II (Anaphylactic Shock) - GRS 3 (Respondent 6)
4. II - Anaphylaxsis - GRS 3 (Respondent 5)
5. I - MI - GRS 3 (Respondent 19)
6. I-VF - GRS 2 (Respondent 13)
7. III-Sepsis - GRS 3 (Respondent 3)
8. IV (VT) - GRS 3 (Respondent 20)
9. II-Anaphylaxsis - GRS 3 (Respondent 23)
10. IV (AF) - GRS 3 (Respondent 11)

Now, group by SessionName:

- ""II (Anaphylaxis)"": 1 respondent, GRS 3 → average 3
- ""V (Hypoglycemia)"": 1 respondent, GRS 2 → average 2
- ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"": 1 respondent, GRS 3 → average 3
- ""II - Anaphylaxsis"": 1 respondent, GRS 3 → average 3
- ""I - MI"": 1 respondent, GRS 3 → average 3
- ""I-VF"": 1 respondent, GRS 2 → average 2
- ""III-Sepsis"": 1 respondent, GRS 3 → average 3
- ""IV (VT)"": 1 respondent, GRS 3 → average 3
- ""II-Anaphylaxsis"": 1 respondent, GRS 3 → average 3
- ""IV (AF)"": 1 respondent, GRS 3 → average 3

Wait, but some SessionNames might be the same but written with different variations. For example, ""II (Anaphylaxis)"", ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"", ""II - Anaphylaxsis"", and ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" could all be different sessions, but perhaps they are variations of the same session. However, since the SessionName is an open-ended field, the exact name matters. Unless there's a note that different spellings are considered the same, we have to treat them as distinct. For example, ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" vs. ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" might be different sessions. Similarly, ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" and ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" could be the same but written with or without a space and hyphen. But without explicit instruction to group them, we must consider them as separate.

However, looking at the example provided in the initial data, the answer was 2 for the session ""I - MI"". In the example data, there was only one respondent (Respondent 19) with that session name, but the answer was 2. That suggests that perhaps in the example, there were two respondents, but in the current data, perhaps the example was different. Wait, maybe the example was part of the user's setup, and the actual data here is different. Let me check the current data again.

In the current data provided under <questionnaire>, looking for SessionName ""I - MI"", there's only Respondent 19. So in the example, the answer was 2, but that's part of the example, not the current data. So in the current task, we need to process the data as given here.

So, each SessionName is treated as a unique session unless the names are exactly the same. For example, ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" and ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"" are different. Similarly, ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" and ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" might be considered different unless there's a typo. Let me check the exact spellings:

- Respondent 5: SessionName ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" (with a space and hyphen)
- Respondent 23: SessionName ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" (hyphen without space)
- Respondent 12: ""II (Anaphylaxis)""
- Respondent 6: ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)""

Assuming that these are all different sessions, each with one respondent. Therefore, each session's average is the same as the individual's GRS because there's only one respondent per session. Wait, but that can't be right. Wait, no, the task is to group by SessionName and calculate the average for each session. If a session has multiple respondents, their GRS scores are averaged. But in the current data, each SessionName appears only once. Let me confirm:

Looking through all respondents:

- ""II (Anaphylaxis)"": only Respondent 12
- ""V (Hypoglycemia)"": only Respondent 1
- ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"": only Respondent 6
- ""II - Anaphylaxsis"": only Respondent 5
- ""I - MI"": only Respondent 19
- ""I-VF"": only Respondent 13
- ""III-Sepsis"": only Respondent 3
- ""IV (VT)"": only Respondent 20
- ""II-Anaphylaxsis"": only Respondent 23
- ""IV (AF)"": only Respondent 11

So each SessionName has exactly one respondent. Therefore, the average GRS for each session is the same as the individual's GRS. Therefore, any session where the GRS is greater than 2.5 (i.e., 3, since the rubric is 0-3 in integers) would have an average of 3. So all sessions with GRS 3 would have an average of 3, which is greater than 2.5. Then, count the number of respondents in those sessions.

Looking at each respondent's GRS:

- Respondent 12: 3 → included
- Respondent 1: 2 → excluded
- Respondent 6: 3 → included
- Respondent 5: 3 → included
- Respondent 19: 3 → included
- Respondent 13: 2 → excluded
- Respondent 3: 3 → included
- Respondent 20: 3 → included
- Respondent 23: 3 → included
- Respondent 11: 3 → included

So total respondents in sessions with average GRS >2.5: Let's count:

Respondent 12, 6,5,19,3,20,23,11. That's 8 respondents. Wait, but let's check each:

- 12: yes (3)
- 6: yes (3)
- 5: yes (3)
- 19: yes (3)
- 3: yes (3)
- 20: yes (3)
- 23: yes (3)
- 11: yes (3)
- Also, Respondent 3: GRS 3 → yes
- Respondent 20: GRS 3 → yes
- Respondent 23: GRS 3 → yes
- Respondent 11: GRS 3 → yes

So that's 8 respondents. Wait, let's count again:

1. Respondent 12: yes
2. Respondent 6: yes
3. Respondent 5: yes
4. Respondent 19: yes
5. Respondent 3: yes
6. Respondent 20: yes
7. Respondent 23: yes
8. Respondent 11: yes

That's 8. But wait, what about Respondent 3? Their SessionName is ""III-Sepsis"" with GRS 3. So yes. So total 8 respondents. But let me check again:

Total respondents with GRS 3:

- 12: 3
- 6: 3
- 5: 3
- 19:3
- 3:3
- 20:3
- 23:3
- 11:3

That's 8. The others (Respondent 1, 13) have GRS 2, so excluded.

Therefore, the answer should be 8.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who participated in a session where the average 'Situation' for that session name is greater than 2.0.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents who participated in a session where the average 'Situation' score for that session name is greater than 2.0. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The data provided includes multiple respondents, each with a SessionName and a 'Situation' score. The 'Situation' question is rated on a rubric from 0 to 3. The goal is to group respondents by their SessionName, calculate the average 'Situation' score for each session, and then count how many respondents are in sessions where this average is above 2.0.

Let me start by listing all the respondents and their SessionNames along with their 'Situation' scores:

- Respondent 3: SessionName ""III-Sepsis"", Situation score 2
- Respondent 17: SessionName ""V (Hypoglycemia)"", Situation score 3
- Respondent 7: SessionName ""III-Sepsis"", Situation score 3
- Respondent 13: SessionName ""I-VF"", Situation score 3
- Respondent 14: SessionName ""IV-Hypoglycemia"", Situation score 3
- Respondent 15: SessionName ""III - Sepsis"", Situation score 3
- Respondent 11: SessionName ""IV (AF)"", Situation score 3
- Respondent 6: SessionName ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"", Situation score 2

Wait, I notice that some SessionNames might be similar but written differently. For example, ""III-Sepsis"" and ""III - Sepsis"" could be the same session but with different formatting. Similarly, ""V (Hypoglycemia)"" and ""IV-Hypoglycemia"" might be different sessions. I need to check if these are considered the same or different based on the data. Let's list each unique SessionName as per the data entries:

1. III-Sepsis (Respondents 3 and 7)
2. V (Hypoglycemia) (Respondent 17)
3. I-VF (Respondent 13)
4. IV-Hypoglycemia (Respondent 14)
5. III - Sepsis (Respondent 15)
6. IV (AF) (Respondent 11)
7. II (Anaphylactic Shock) (Respondent 6)

Now, I need to calculate the average 'Situation' score for each SessionName. Let's go through each:

1. III-Sepsis: Respondents 3 (Situation=2) and 7 (Situation=3). Average = (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5
2. V (Hypoglycemia): Only Respondent 17 with Situation=3. Average = 3.0
3. I-VF: Respondent 13 with Situation=3. Average = 3.0
4. IV-Hypoglycemia: Respondent 14 with Situation=3. Average = 3.0
5. III - Sepsis: Respondent 15 with Situation=3. Average = 3.0
6. IV (AF): Respondent 11 with Situation=3. Average = 3.0
7. II (Anaphylactic Shock): Respondent 6 with Situation=2. Average = 2.0

Wait, but ""III-Sepsis"" and ""III - Sepsis"" are written slightly differently. Are they considered the same session? The problem might consider them as separate sessions if the names are different. For example, ""III-Sepsis"" vs. ""III - Sepsis"" (with a space and hyphen). However, in the data, Respondent 15's SessionName is ""III - Sepsis"" with a space, while Respondents 3 and 7 have ""III-Sepsis"" without the space. Unless there's a typo, these might be different sessions. But maybe it's a formatting inconsistency. Let's check the original data again.

Looking back:

- Respondent 3: SessionName: III-Sepsis
- Respondent 7: SessionName: III-Sepsis
- Respondent 15: SessionName: III - Sepsis (with a space before and after the hyphen)

Hmm, the hyphen placement is different. If the SessionName is taken exactly as written, then ""III-Sepsis"" and ""III - Sepsis"" are different. Therefore, they would be treated as separate sessions. So, the average for ""III-Sepsis"" is 2.5 (from respondents 3 and 7), and the average for ""III - Sepsis"" is 3.0 (from respondent 15). 

But maybe that's a mistake. For example, maybe the hyphen placement is a typo, and they should be considered the same. However, without explicit information that they are the same, I should treat them as different. So, proceeding with the exact names as given.

Now, the next step is to check which sessions have an average 'Situation' score greater than 2.0. Let's list the averages:

1. III-Sepsis: 2.5 > 2.0 → Yes
2. V (Hypoglycemia): 3.0 > 2.0 → Yes
3. I-VF: 3.0 > 2.0 → Yes
4. IV-Hypoglycemia: 3.0 > 2.0 → Yes
5. III - Sepsis: 3.0 > 2.0 → Yes
6. IV (AF): 3.0 > 2.0 → Yes
7. II (Anaphylactic Shock): 2.0 → Not greater than 2.0

So, all sessions except ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"" have an average 'Situation' score above 2.0. Now, count the number of respondents in each qualifying session:

- III-Sepsis: 2 respondents (3 and 7)
- V (Hypoglycemia): 1 (17)
- I-VF: 1 (13)
- IV-Hypoglycemia: 1 (14)
- III - Sepsis: 1 (15)
- IV (AF): 1 (11)

Total respondents in qualifying sessions: 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7.

Wait, but let me recount:

III-Sepsis: 2
V (Hypoglycemia): 1
I-VF:1
IV-Hypoglycemia:1
III - Sepsis:1
IV (AF):1
Total: 2+1+1+1+1+1=7.

But wait, the answer in the example was 2, but that was for a different question. However, in this case, the correct answer would be 7. But let me double-check.

Wait, the example given in the problem had an answer of 2, but that was for a different question (how many in 'I - MI' session). So, in this current task, the answer is 7. But let me confirm again.

Wait, the sessions that qualify (average >2.0) are:

- III-Sepsis (2.5)
- V (Hypoglycemia) (3.0)
- I-VF (3.0)
- IV-Hypoglycemia (3.0)
- III - Sepsis (3.0)
- IV (AF) (3.0)

Each of these sessions has an average above 2.0. The number of respondents in these sessions:

III-Sepsis: 2
V (Hypoglycemia):1
I-VF:1
IV-Hypoglycemia:1
III - Sepsis:1
IV (AF):1
Total: 2+1+1+1+1+1=7.

But wait, the SessionName ""III - Sepsis"" (with spaces) has only Respondent 15. So that's 1. The original III-Sepsis (without spaces) has 2 respondents. So total 2+1=3 for Sepsis-related sessions? No, because they are considered different sessions here. So each is separate.

Therefore, the total number of respondents in sessions with average 'Situation' >2.0 is 7. But let me check again each session's average:

III-Sepsis: 2 and 3 → average 2.5 → yes
V (Hypoglycemia): 3 → 3 → yes
I-VF:3 → yes
IV-Hypoglycemia:3 → yes
III - Sepsis:3 → yes
IV (AF):3 → yes
II (Anaphylactic Shock):2 → no

So 6 sessions qualify, with a total of 2+1+1+1+1+1=7 respondents.

But wait, the SessionName ""III - Sepsis"" (Respondent 15) is separate from ""III-Sepsis"" (Respondents 3 and 7). So each is a separate session. Therefore, the count is correct.

Thus, the answer should be 7.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who participated in a session where the average 'Background (examination)' for that session name is greater than 2.0.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the number of respondents who participated in a session where the average 'Background (examination)' score for that session name is greater than 2.0. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The data provided includes multiple respondents, each with a SessionName and various scores, including 'Background (examination)'. The 'Background (examination)' is a rubric-based score ranging from 0 to 3. 

The goal is to group respondents by their SessionName, calculate the average 'Background (examination)' score for each session, and then count how many respondents are in sessions where this average is above 2.0.

Let me start by listing all the SessionNames and their corresponding 'Background (examination)' scores from each respondent. 

Looking at the responses:

- Respondent 10: SessionName (MI)-VT, Background (examination): 2
- Respondent 11: IV (AF), 3
- Respondent 19: I - MI, 3
- Respondent 20: IV (VT), -1 (Wait, the rubric for Background (examination) is 0-3. But here it's -1. Maybe a typo? But according to the data, it's -1. Hmm, but the rubric doesn't include negative values. Maybe it's an error, but I have to take the data as given. So this score is -1.)
- Respondent 3: III-Sepsis, 3
- Respondent 2: MI, 3
- Respondent 5: II - Anaphylaxsis, 3
- Respondent 6: II (Anaphylactic Shock), 3
- Respondent 13: I-VF, 1
- Respondent 23: II-Anaphylaxsis, 2

Now, group by SessionName and calculate the average for each:

1. (MI)-VT: Only Respondent 10. Score 2. Average is 2.0. Since the task is looking for average >2.0, this doesn't qualify.
2. IV (AF): Respondent 11. Score 3. Average 3.0. This is above 2.0. So all respondents in IV (AF) (just 1) would count.
3. I - MI: Respondent 19. Score 3. Average 3.0. So this session's average is above 2.0. Respondent 19 counts.
4. IV (VT): Respondent 20. Score -1. Average -1.0. Below 2.0. Exclude.
5. III-Sepsis: Respondent 3. Score 3. Average 3.0. So this session's average is 3.0. Respondent 3 counts.
6. MI: Respondent 2. Score 3. Average 3.0. So this session (MI) has average 3.0. Respondent 2 counts.
7. II - Anaphylaxsis: Respondent 5. Score 3. Average 3.0. So this session's average is 3.0. Respondent 5 counts.
8. II (Anaphylactic Shock): Respondent 6. Score 3. Average 3.0. So this session's average is 3.0. Respondent 6 counts.
9. I-VF: Respondent 13. Score 1. Average 1.0. Below 2.0. Exclude.
10. II-Anaphylaxsis: Respondent 23. Score 2. Average 2.0. The task says greater than 2.0, so this is exactly 2.0, which doesn't meet the condition. Exclude.

Wait, but II-Anaphylaxsis (Respondent 23) has a score of 2. So average is 2.0. So that's not greater than 2.0. So sessions that qualify are:

- IV (AF): 1 respondent (11)
- I - MI: 1 (19)
- III-Sepsis: 1 (3)
- MI: 1 (2)
- II - Anaphylaxsis: 1 (5)
- II (Anaphylactic Shock): 1 (6)

Wait, but wait, are II - Anaphylaxsis and II-Anaphylaxsis the same session? Let me check. The SessionNames are:

Respondent 5: II - Anaphylaxsis
Respondent 23: II-Anaphylaxsis

The hyphen placement is different. Are these considered the same session? The problem says to group by SessionName. So if the names are different, even slightly, they are separate. For example, ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" vs. ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" (with a space vs. without). So they are different sessions. Therefore, each is treated separately. 

So for Respondent 5: SessionName is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" (with space), and their score is 3. So average for that session is 3.0. So that's one session. Respondent 5 is part of that session. 

Respondent 23: SessionName is ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" (no space), score 2. So average is 2.0. So that session doesn't qualify. 

Similarly, ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"" is another session. 

So the qualifying sessions are:

- IV (AF): 1 respondent (11)
- I - MI: 1 (19)
- III-Sepsis: 1 (3)
- MI: 1 (2)
- II - Anaphylaxsis: 1 (5)
- II (Anaphylactic Shock): 1 (6)

Each of these sessions has an average 'Background (examination)' score greater than 2.0. 

So total respondents in these sessions: 1+1+1+1+1+1 = 6.

Wait, but let me double-check each session's average:

- IV (AF): 3.0 (only one respondent)
- I - MI: 3.0 (only one)
- III-Sepsis: 3.0 (only one)
- MI: 3.0 (only one)
- II - Anaphylaxsis: 3.0 (only one)
- II (Anaphylactic Shock): 3.0 (only one)

Each of these sessions has a single respondent, so their individual scores are the average. All of these are 3 except for II (Anaphylactic Shock) which is 3. So all qualify. 

So the total number of respondents is 6. 

But wait, let me check again. Are there any other sessions with multiple respondents? For example, the original example had ""I - MI"" and ""MI"" as separate sessions. So ""MI"" (Respondent 2) and ""I - MI"" (Respondent 19) are different sessions. 

So each of these sessions has one respondent each. Therefore, the count is 6 respondents. 

But wait, let me check all the SessionNames again to ensure I didn't miss any:

Looking at all SessionNames:

1. (MI)-VT (Respondent 10)
2. IV (AF) (11)
3. I - MI (19)
4. IV (VT) (20)
5. III-Sepsis (3)
6. MI (2)
7. II - Anaphylaxsis (5)
8. II (Anaphylactic Shock) (6)
9. I-VF (13)
10. II-Anaphylaxsis (23)

Each of these is a unique session. So the qualifying sessions are those where the average is >2.0. For each qualifying session, count the number of respondents in that session. Since each qualifying session has only one respondent, the total is 6. 

Therefore, the answer should be 6.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who participated in a session where the average 'Assessment' for that session name is greater than 2.5.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents who participated in a session where the average 'Assessment' score for that session name is greater than 2.5. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The data provided includes multiple respondents, each with a SessionName and an Assessment score. The Assessment is a rubric-based score ranging from 0 to 3. 

The key steps here are:
1. Group all respondents by their SessionName.
2. For each group (session), calculate the average Assessment score.
3. Identify which sessions have an average Assessment greater than 2.5.
4. Count all respondents that belong to those sessions.

Let me start by listing all the respondents and their SessionNames along with their Assessment scores.

Looking at the responses:

- Respondent 22: SessionName ""IV (VT)"", Assessment 2
- Respondent 3: SessionName ""III-Sepsis"", Assessment 3
- Respondent 9: SessionName ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"", Assessment 2
- Respondent 15: SessionName ""III - Sepsis"", Assessment 2
- Respondent 14: SessionName ""IV-Hypoglycemia"", Assessment 3
- Respondent 16: SessionName ""I - MI"", Assessment 3
- Respondent 20: SessionName ""IV (VT)"", Assessment 3
- Respondent 19: SessionName ""I - MI"", Assessment 2

Now, group them by SessionName:

1. IV (VT): Respondents 22 (Assessment 2) and 20 (Assessment 3). Total Assessments: 2 + 3 = 5. Average: 5/2 = 2.5. Since the average is exactly 2.5, which is not greater than 2.5, this session doesn't qualify.

2. III-Sepsis: Respondent 3 (Assessment 3). Average: 3/1 = 3.0. This is greater than 2.5.

3. III - Sepsis: Respondent 15 (Assessment 2). Average: 2/1 = 2.0. Not qualifying.

4. II (Anaphylaxsis): Respondent 9 (Assessment 2). Average: 2.0. Not qualifying.

5. IV-Hypoglycemia: Respondent 14 (Assessment 3). Average: 3.0. This is greater than 2.5.

6. I - MI: Respondents 16 (Assessment 3) and 19 (Assessment 2). Total: 3 + 2 = 5. Average: 5/2 = 2.5. Again, exactly 2.5, so not qualifying.

Wait, but the problem states ""average greater than 2.5"". So sessions with average exactly 2.5 are excluded. 

So the qualifying sessions are III-Sepsis (average 3.0) and IV-Hypoglycemia (average 3.0). 

Now, count the respondents in these sessions:

- III-Sepsis: 1 respondent (Respondent 3)
- IV-Hypoglycemia: 1 respondent (Respondent 14)

Total respondents: 1 + 1 = 2.

Wait, but let me double-check. Are there any other sessions I missed? Let me list all session names again:

IV (VT), III-Sepsis, II (Anaphylaxsis), III - Sepsis (note the hyphen and space), IV-Hypoglycemia, I - MI. 

Wait, ""III-Sepsis"" and ""III - Sepsis"" might be the same session but written differently. Let me check the SessionNames again. 

Looking at the data:

Respondent 3: SessionName ""III-Sepsis""
Respondent 15: SessionName ""III - Sepsis""

These are two different ways of writing the session name. The hyphen placement and spacing differ. So, they are considered separate sessions. Therefore, each has only one respondent. 

So, III-Sepsis (Respondent 3) has an average of 3.0, and III - Sepsis (Respondent 15) has an average of 2.0. 

IV-Hypoglycemia (Respondent 14) has an average of 3.0. 

So the qualifying sessions are III-Sepsis and IV-Hypoglycemia, each with one respondent. 

Therefore, the total number of respondents is 2. 

But wait, let me check again. Are there any other sessions with average >2.5? 

Another session is IV-Hypoglycemia (Respondent 14, Assessment 3). So average is 3.0. 

So total respondents in qualifying sessions: 1 (III-Sepsis) + 1 (IV-Hypoglycemia) = 2. 

But wait, what about Respondent 3 and 15? Their SessionNames are similar but written differently. The problem might consider them as the same session. For example, ""III-Sepsis"" vs. ""III - Sepsis"" could be a typo or formatting difference. If that's the case, then combining them would give two respondents (3 and 15) with Assessments 3 and 2. The average would be (3+2)/2 = 2.5, which is not greater than 2.5. So that session wouldn't qualify. 

But according to the data as given, the SessionNames are written differently. Unless instructed otherwise, we should treat them as separate sessions. Therefore, the answer remains 2 respondents. 

Wait, but let me check the original example. In the example, the answer was 2 for a similar question. But in that case, the SessionName was ""I - MI"", and there were two respondents (16 and 19). Their average was (3+2)/2=2.5, which didn't qualify. But the example's answer was 2. Wait, no, the example's question was ""How many respondents participated in a 'I - MI' session?"" which had two respondents, hence the answer 2. But in the current task, the answer would be different. 

But in our current task, the qualifying sessions are III-Sepsis (average 3.0) and IV-Hypoglycemia (average 3.0), each with one respondent. So total respondents is 2. 

Therefore, the answer should be 2.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents whose comments contain 'Good' also have a total score across all rubric items that is below the average total score for all sessions?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking how many respondents have comments containing the word 'Good' and also have a total score below the average total score of all sessions. 

First, I need to identify which respondents have comments with 'Good'. Looking through the comments in each response:

- Respondent 12's comment is ""Good"".
- Respondent 21's comment mentions ""Good and early assessment..."".
- Respondent 11's comment is ""Clear communication and handover"" – no 'Good' here.
- Others like Respondent 17, 4, 14, 10, 16, 9 don't have 'Good' in their comments.

So, Respondents 12 and 21 have 'Good' in their comments.

Next, calculate each respondent's total score. The rubric items are questions 3 to 9, each scored 0-3. Let's compute totals:

- Respondent 7: 3+3+2+3+2+2+2 = 17
- Respondent 17: 3+3+3+3+3+3+2 = 20
- Respondent 4: 3+3+3+2+2+2+2 = 17
- Respondent 12: 3+3+3+3+2+3+3 = 20
- Respondent 14: 3+3+2+2+3+1+2 = 16
- Respondent 21: 3+2+3+1+2+3+3 = 17
- Respondent 10: 2+2+2+2+2+2+2 = 14
- Respondent 16: 3+3+3+3+3+2+3 = 20
- Respondent 9: 3+3+2+2+2+3+2 = 17
- Respondent 11: 3+3+3+3+3+3+3 = 21

Now, find the average total score. Sum all totals and divide by number of respondents (10):

17 + 20 +17 +20 +16 +17 +14 +20 +17 +21 = 179. Average is 179 /10 = 17.9.

Now, check the total scores of Respondents 12 and 21. 

- Respondent 12's total is 20, which is above 17.9.
- Respondent 21's total is 17, which is below 17.9.

So only Respondent 21 meets both conditions. Therefore, the answer is 1.

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the respondents who participated in a session where the average 'Situation' for that session name is greater than 2.0.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the number of respondents who participated in a session where the average 'Situation' score for that session name is greater than 2.0. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The data provided includes multiple respondents, each with a SessionName and a Situation score. The Situation score is a rubric-based value ranging from 0 to 3. 

The key steps here are:
1. Group all respondents by their SessionName.
2. For each group (session), calculate the average Situation score.
3. Identify which sessions have an average Situation score greater than 2.0.
4. Count all respondents that belong to those sessions.

Let me start by listing all the respondents and their SessionName along with their Situation scores.

Looking at the data:

- Respondent 2: SessionName ""MI"", Situation 3
- Respondent 8: SessionName ""III (Sepsis)"", Situation 3
- Respondent 13: SessionName ""I-VF"", Situation 3
- Respondent 20: SessionName ""IV (VT)"", Situation 3
- Respondent 23: SessionName ""II-Anaphylaxsis"", Situation 3
- Respondent 1: SessionName ""V (Hypoglycemia)"", Situation 2
- Respondent 7: SessionName ""III-Sepsis"", Situation 3
- Respondent 10: SessionName ""(MI)-VT"", Situation 2
- Respondent 4: SessionName ""III (Sepsis)"", Situation 3
- Respondent 21: SessionName ""I (Myocardial infarction)"", Situation 2

Now, group them by SessionName:

1. MI: Respondents 2 and 10 (Wait, no. Respondent 10's SessionName is ""(MI)-VT"", which might be a different session. Let me check. The SessionName for Respondent 10 is ""(MI)-VT"". So that's a separate session. So ""MI"" is only Respondent 2. Then ""(MI)-VT"" is another session with Respondent 10.

2. III (Sepsis): Respondents 8 and 4. Wait, Respondent 8's SessionName is ""III (Sepsis)"", and Respondent 4's is also ""III (Sepsis)"". So that's two respondents here.

3. I-VF: Respondent 13.

4. IV (VT): Respondent 20.

5. II-Anaphylaxsis: Respondent 23.

6. V (Hypoglycemia): Respondent 1.

7. III-Sepsis: Respondent 7. Wait, the SessionName here is ""III-Sepsis"". Is that the same as ""III (Sepsis)""? The names are slightly different: one uses parentheses, the other a hyphen. But the content is ""III Sepsis"" vs. ""III (Sepsis)"". Are these considered the same session? The problem states that the SessionName is an open-ended field, so exact string matching is required. Since ""III-Sepsis"" and ""III (Sepsis)"" are different strings, they are different sessions. So Respondent 7 is in a separate session.

8. (MI)-VT: Respondent 10.

9. I (Myocardial infarction): Respondent 21.

Now, for each session, calculate the average Situation score:

1. MI (Respondent 2): Situation 3. Only one respondent. Average = 3.0. This is greater than 2.0.

2. III (Sepsis) (Respondents 8 and 4): Both have Situation 3. Average = (3 + 3)/2 = 3.0. Greater than 2.0.

3. I-VF (Respondent 13): Situation 3. Average 3.0. >2.0.

4. IV (VT) (Respondent 20): Situation 3. Average 3.0. >2.0.

5. II-Anaphylaxsis (Respondent 23): Situation 3. Average 3.0. >2.0.

6. V (Hypoglycemia) (Respondent 1): Situation 2. Average 2.0. Not greater than 2.0.

7. III-Sepsis (Respondent 7): Situation 3. Average 3.0. >2.0.

8. (MI)-VT (Respondent 10): Situation 2. Average 2.0. Not greater than 2.0.

9. I (Myocardial infarction) (Respondent 21): Situation 2. Average 2.0. Not greater than 2.0.

So the sessions with average Situation >2.0 are: MI, III (Sepsis), I-VF, IV (VT), II-Anaphylaxsis, III-Sepsis.

Now, count all respondents in these sessions:

- MI: 1 (Respondent 2)
- III (Sepsis): 2 (8 and 4)
- I-VF: 1 (13)
- IV (VT): 1 (20)
- II-Anaphylaxsis: 1 (23)
- III-Sepsis: 1 (7)

Total respondents: 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7.

Wait, let me check again:

MI: 1
III (Sepsis): 2
I-VF:1
IV (VT):1
II-Anaphylaxsis:1
III-Sepsis:1

Total: 1+2=3, +1=4, +1=5, +1=6, +1=7. So 7 respondents.

But wait, let me verify each session's respondents:

- MI: Respondent 2. Correct.
- III (Sepsis): Respondents 8 and 4. Correct.
- I-VF: 13. Correct.
- IV (VT): 20. Correct.
- II-Anaphylaxsis:23. Correct.
- III-Sepsis:7. Correct.

Yes, that's 1+2+1+1+1+1=7.

So the answer should be 7.

<task>
How many respondents have a 'Identification' score that is higher than the average 'Identification' for all sessions on the same date?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find out how many respondents have an 'Identification' score higher than the average 'Identification' score for all sessions on the same date. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The data provided includes multiple respondents, each with a Date, SessionName, and various scores including Identification. The Identification score is a rubric-based value ranging from 0 to 3. 

The key steps here are:
1. Calculate the average Identification score for each date.
2. For each respondent, compare their Identification score to the average of their respective date.
3. Count how many respondents have a score higher than their date's average.

Let me start by listing all the respondents along with their dates and Identification scores:

- Respondent 9: 2025-05-04, Identification 3
- Respondent 10: 2025-03-14, Identification 2
- Respondent 11: 2025-04-04, Identification 3
- Respondent 4: 2025-05-16, Identification 3
- Respondent 1: 2025-05-02, Identification -1 (Wait, the rubric for Identification is 0-3. But here, Respondent 1 has -1. That might be an error, but according to the data, it's -1. I'll have to include it as is unless specified otherwise.)
- Respondent 16: 2025-05-02, Identification 3
- Respondent 14: 2025-03-14, Identification 3
- Respondent 6: 2025-04-04, Identification 3
- Respondent 3: 2025-04-04, Identification 0

Now, group the respondents by date and calculate the average Identification for each date.

Let's process each date:

1. **2025-05-04**: Only Respondent 9. Average is 3. So, compare each respondent on this date (only one) to 3. Respondent 9's score is 3, which is equal, not higher. So no one here.

2. **2025-03-14**: Respondents 10 and 14.
   - Respondent 10: 2
   - Respondent 14: 3
   Total = 2 + 3 = 5. Average = 5/2 = 2.5
   So, respondents scoring higher than 2.5: Respondent 14 (3 > 2.5). So count 1.

3. **2025-04-04**: Respondents 11, 6, and 3.
   - Respondent 11: 3
   - Respondent 6: 3
   - Respondent 3: 0
   Total = 3 + 3 + 0 = 6. Average = 6/3 = 2
   Scores higher than 2: Respondents 11 (3), 6 (3). So count 2.

4. **2025-05-16**: Only Respondent 4. Average is 3. Respondent 4's score is 3, equal. No count.

5. **2025-05-02**: Respondents 1 and 16.
   - Respondent 1: -1
   - Respondent 16: 3
   Total = -1 + 3 = 2. Average = 2/2 = 1
   Scores higher than 1: Respondent 16 (3 > 1). So count 1.

Now, summing up the counts from each date:
- 2025-03-14: 1
- 2025-04-04: 2
- 2025-05-02: 1
Total = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations to ensure there are no mistakes.

For 2025-03-14: (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5. Scores above 2.5 are 3, so Respondent 14. Correct.

For 2025-04-04: (3 + 3 + 0)/3 = 2. Scores above 2 are 3 and 3. Correct.

For 2025-05-02: (-1 + 3)/2 = 1. Scores above 1 are 3. Correct.

So total of 4 respondents. But let me check each respondent again:

- Respondent 14: 3 > 2.5 → yes
- Respondent 11: 3 > 2 → yes
- Respondent 6: 3 > 2 → yes
- Respondent 16: 3 > 1 → yes

Yes, that's four respondents. So the answer should be 4.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents have a 'Background (examination)' score that is higher than the average 'Background (examination)' for all sessions on the same date?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find out how many respondents have a 'Background (examination)' score higher than the average 'Background (examination)' score for all sessions on the same date. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The data provided includes multiple respondents, each with a Date, SessionName, and various scores, including 'Background (examination)'. 

The plan is as follows:
1. For each respondent, note their Date and Background (examination) score.
2. Calculate the average Background (examination) score for each date.
3. Compare each respondent's score to the average of their respective date.
4. Count how many respondents have a score higher than their date's average.

Let's start by listing all respondents with their dates and Background (examination) scores.

Looking at the data:

Respondent 18: Date 2025-05-04, Score 2
Respondent 8: 2025-05-02, Score 2
Respondent 17: 2025-05-04, Score 3
Respondent 23: 2025-03-14, Score 2
Respondent 12: 2025-05-02, Score 3
Respondent 3: 2025-04-04, Score 3
Respondent 13: 2025-03-14, Score 1
Respondent 2: 2025-04-04, Score 3
Respondent 7: 2025-03-14, Score 3
Respondent 1: 2025-05-02, Score 2
Respondent 22: 2025-05-16, Score 3

Now, group them by date and calculate the average for each date.

Let's process each date:

1. 2025-03-14:
   Respondents: 23 (Score 2), 13 (1), 7 (3)
   Scores: 2, 1, 3 → Sum = 6 → Average = 6/3 = 2

2. 2025-04-04:
   Respondents: 3 (3), 2 (3)
   Scores: 3, 3 → Sum = 6 → Average = 6/2 = 3

3. 2025-05-02:
   Respondents: 8 (2), 12 (3), 1 (2)
   Scores: 2, 3, 2 → Sum = 7 → Average ≈ 2.333...

4. 2025-05-04:
   Respondents: 18 (2), 17 (3)
   Scores: 2, 3 → Sum = 5 → Average = 2.5

5. 2025-05-16:
   Respondent: 22 (3)
   Only one respondent, so average is 3.

Now, compare each respondent's score to their date's average:

- Respondent 18 (2025-05-04, Score 2 vs. Avg 2.5): 2 < 2.5 → No
- Respondent 8 (2025-05-02, 2 vs. ~2.333): 2 < 2.333 → No
- Respondent 17 (2025-05-04, 3 vs. 2.5): 3 > 2.5 → Yes
- Respondent 23 (2025-03-14, 2 vs. 2): Equal → No
- Respondent 12 (2025-05-02, 3 vs. ~2.333): 3 > 2.333 → Yes
- Respondent 3 (2024-04-04, 3 vs. 3): Equal → No
- Respondent 13 (2025-03-14, 1 vs. 2): 1 < 2 → No
- Respondent 2 (2025-04-04, 3 vs. 3): Equal → No
- Respondent 7 (2025-03-14, 3 vs. 2): 3 > 2 → Yes
- Respondent 1 (2025-05-02, 2 vs. ~2.333): 2 < 2.333 → No
- Respondent 22 (2025-05-16, 3 vs. 3): Equal → No

Now, count the ""Yes"" cases. Respondents 17, 12, and 7 have scores higher than their date's average. That's 3 respondents.

Wait, let me double-check:

For 2025-03-14, the average is 2. Respondent 7 has a score of 3, which is higher. So that's one. Respondent 12 is in 2025-05-02, where the average is ~2.333, and their score is 3, which is higher. Respondent 17 is in 2025-05-04, average 2.5, score 3. So three respondents. 

Yes, that's correct. So the answer should be 3.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents whose comments contain 'Clear' also have a total score across all rubric items that is below the average total score for all sessions?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking: How many respondents whose comments contain 'Clear' also have a total score across all rubric items that is below the average total score for all sessions?

First, I need to break down the requirements. 

1. Identify all respondents whose comments include the word 'Clear'. 
2. Calculate the total score for each of those respondents.
3. Find the average total score across all sessions.
4. Compare each of the identified respondents' total scores to this average.
5. Count how many of them have a total score below the average.

Let's start by going through each respondent's data.

Looking at the responses:

- Respondent 11: Comments say ""Clear communication and handover"". So 'Clear' is present. Let's note their total score. Their rubric scores are all 3s except for Assessment and Recommendations which are 3. Wait, looking at their data: Identification:3, Situation:3, Background (history):3, Background (examination):3, Assessment:3, Recommendation (clear recommendation):3, GRS:3. So total is 3+3+3+3+3+3+3 = 21. Wait, but the rubric items are from Q3 to Q9. Let me check the questions again. The rubric items are Q3 to Q9, which are 7 items. Each is scored 0-3. So each respondent has 7 scores. Let me confirm:

For Respondent 11: Q3=3, Q4=3, Q5=3, Q6=3, Q7=3, Q8=3, Q9=3. So 7*3=21. Total score 21.

Respondent 19: Comments include ""Clarity is a bit low over whole case scenario"" but also ""Satisfactory"". Wait, the comment starts with ""Wrong CPR position"" and then ""Clarity is a bit low..."". The word 'Clear' isn't in the comments here. Wait, the exact comments are: ""Wrong CPR position Clarity is a bit low over whole case scenario Satisfactory"". The word 'Clarity' is present, but the question is looking for 'Clear' in the comments. Since 'Clarity' is a different word, this respondent's comments don't contain 'Clear'. So Respondent 19 is not included.

Respondent 14: Comments: ""Late response for considering consultation"". No 'Clear' here.

Respondent 22: Comments: ""Clear communication skills Good"". So 'Clear' is present. Let's calculate their total. Their scores: Q3=3, Q4=3, Q5=3, Q6=3, Q7=2, Q8=2, Q9=3. Total: 3+3+3+3+2+2+3 = 19.

Respondent 13: Comments mention ""Lack of communication..."" and ""Further brief to patient..."". No 'Clear' here.

Respondent 21: Comments: ""Diagnostic clarity is present Good and early assessment..."". 'Clarity' again, not 'Clear', so not included.

Respondent 10: Comments: ""Time: (15:53-16:14)"". No 'Clear'.

Respondent 4: Comments: ""Clinical handover and communication skills, satisfactory No panic, no arrest team Satisfactory"". No 'Clear' here.

So the respondents with 'Clear' in comments are Respondent 11 and Respondent 22.

Now, calculate their total scores:

- Respondent 11: 21
- Respondent 22: 19

Next, compute the average total score for all sessions. Let's list all respondents' total scores.

First, list all respondents and their scores:

Respondent 11: 3,3,3,3,3,3,3 → 21
Respondent 19: 3,3,3,3,2,3,3 → Let's add: 3+3+3+3+2+3+3 = 20
Respondent 14: 3,3,2,2,3,1,2 → Wait, let's check:

Respondent 14's data:
Identification:3, Situation:3, Background (history):2, Background (examination):2, Assessment:3, Recommendation (clear recommendation):1, GRS:2. So total: 3+3+2+2+3+1+2 = 16.

Respondent 22: 3,3,3,3,2,2,3 → 19 (as before)
Respondent 13: 3,3,2,1,2,2,2 → 3+3=6, +2=8, +1=9, +2=11, +2=13, +2=15. Total 15.
Respondent 21: 3,2,3,1,2,3,3 → 3+2=5, +3=8, +1=9, +2=11, +3=14, +3=17. Wait, let's recount:

Wait, Q3:3, Q4:2, Q5:3, Q6:1, Q7:2, Q8:3, Q9:3. So 3+2+3+1+2+3+3= 17.

Respondent 10: 2,2,2,2,2,2,2 → 14.

Respondent 4: 3,3,3,2,2,2,2 → 3+3=6+3=9+2=11+2=13+2=15+2=17.

So all total scores:

11:21

19:20

14:16

22:19

13:15

21:17

10:14

4:17

Now, sum all these totals and divide by the number of respondents (8).

Sum: 21 +20 +16 +19 +15 +17 +14 +17 = Let's add step by step:

21+20=41; 41+16=57; 57+19=76; 76+15=91; 91+17=108; 108+14=122; 122+17=139.

Total sum is 139. Number of respondents is 8. Average is 139 /8 = 17.375.

Now, the average total score is 17.375.

Now, check which of the respondents with 'Clear' in comments have total below this average.

Respondent 11: 21. 21 >17.375 → Not below.

Respondent 22: 19. 19 >17.375 → Also not below. Wait, 19 is higher than 17.375. So neither of them are below the average. Wait, but that can't be right. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recheck the total scores and the average.

Wait, the sum is 139 for 8 respondents. 139 divided by 8 is 17.375. Correct.

Respondent 11:21 (above average), Respondent 22:19 (also above average). So neither of them have a total score below the average. Therefore, the answer would be 0.

But wait, maybe I missed other respondents with 'Clear' in comments. Let me check again.

Looking back at the comments:

Respondent 11: ""Clear communication and handover"" → 'Clear' present.

Respondent 22: ""Clear communication skills Good"" → 'Clear' present.

Any others? Respondent 4's comments: ""Clinical handover and communication skills, satisfactory"" → no 'Clear'.

Respondent 19: ""Clarity is a bit low..."" → 'Clarity' not 'Clear'.

So only two respondents. Both have totals above the average. So the answer is 0.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents whose comments contain 'Satisfactory' also have a total score across all rubric items that is below the average total score for all sessions?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking: How many respondents whose comments contain 'Satisfactory' also have a total score across all rubric items that is below the average total score for all sessions?

First, I need to understand the data structure. The data provided includes multiple respondents, each with various rubric scores and comments. The task involves two main parts: 

1. Identify all respondents whose comments include the word 'Satisfactory'.
2. Calculate their total scores and compare each to the average total score of all sessions to see if they are below that average.

Let me start by breaking down the steps required.

**Step 1: Calculate Total Scores for All Respondents**

Each respondent has several rubric items (from Identification to Recommendation (global rating scale)). The rubric items are numbered 3 to 9 in the questions section. Each of these has a score (from 0 to 3, except for some that might have -1, like Respondent 1's Identification score). 

Wait, looking at the data, I see some scores are -1. For example, Respondent 1's Identification is -1. But the rubric for Identification is 0-3. So maybe -1 is an invalid or missing value. How should I handle that? The problem says ""total score across all rubric items"". The rubric items are all scored 0-3, so perhaps -1 is an error. But since the data is given, I need to process it as is. However, the problem might consider -1 as a valid score. Wait, looking at the schema for Identification: the rubric is 0-3. So a -1 is not a valid value. But in the data, Respondent 1 has Identification: -1. Maybe that's a typo, but since the data is given, I have to include it as is. So when calculating total scores, I need to sum all rubric items, including any negative values. But maybe the -1 is a mistake. For example, in Respondent 1's case, Identification is -1. But the rubric for Identification is 0-3. So perhaps that's a data entry error. However, since the problem doesn't mention handling such cases, I should proceed with the data as given, treating -1 as part of the score. Alternatively, maybe it's a missing value, but the problem doesn't specify, so I'll include it in the total.

Wait, but the problem says ""total score across all rubric items"". The rubric items are questions 3 to 9. Let me list them:

3. Identification
4. Situation
5. Background (history)
6. Background (examination)
7. Assessment
8. Recommendation (clear recommendation)
9. Recommendation (global rating scale)

Each of these is a rubric item with a score. So each respondent has 7 rubric scores. The total score for each respondent is the sum of these 7 scores.

So first, I need to calculate the total score for each respondent by adding up their scores for questions 3 to 9. Then, compute the average total score across all respondents. Then, for each respondent whose comments include 'Satisfactory', check if their total score is below that average. Finally, count how many such respondents there are.

Let me start by calculating each respondent's total score.

**Calculating Total Scores:**

Let's go through each respondent one by one.

**Respondent 1:**
- Identification: -1
- Situation: 2
- Background (history): 2
- Background (examination): 2
- Assessment: 3
- Recommendation (clear recommendation): 2
- Recommendation (global rating scale): 2
Total = (-1) + 2 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 2 = Let's compute: (-1 +2)=1; 1+2=3; 3+2=5; 5+3=8; 8+2=10; 10+2=12. So total 12.

**Respondent 11:**
All rubric scores are 3 except maybe? Let's check:
- Identification:3
- Situation:3
- Background (history):3
- Background (examination):3
- Assessment:3
- Recommendation (clear recommendation):3
- Recommendation (global rating scale):3
Total: 3*7=21.

**Respondent 6:**
- Identification:3
- Situation:2
- Background (history):3
- Background (examination):3
- Assessment:2
- Recommendation (clear recommendation):2
- Recommendation (global rating scale):3
Total: 3+2+3+3+2+2+3= 3+2=5; 5+3=8; 8+3=11; 11+2=13; 13+2=15; 15+3=18.

Wait, wait, let me add again: 3 (Id) +2 (Sit) =5; +3 (hist)=8; +3 (exam)=11; +2 (assess)=13; +2 (rec)=15; +3 (GRS)=18. So total 18.

**Respondent 20:**
- Identification:3
- Situation:3
- Background (history):2
- Background (examination):-1
- Assessment:3
- Recommendation (clear recommendation):2
- Recommendation (global rating scale):3
Total: 3+3=6; +2=8; +(-1)=7; +3=10; +2=12; +3=15. Total 15.

**Respondent 15:**
- Identification:3
- Situation:3
- Background (history):2
- Background (examination):3
- Assessment:2
- Recommendation (clear recommendation):2
- Recommendation (global rating scale):2
Total: 3+3=6; +2=8; +3=11; +2=13; +2=15; +2=17. Wait, 3+3=6, +2 (history)=8, +3 (exam)=11, +2 (assess)=13, +2 (rec)=15, +2 (GRS)=17. So total 17.

**Respondent 12:**
- Identification:3
- Situation:3
- Background (history):3
- Background (examination):3
- Assessment:2
- Recommendation (clear recommendation):3
- Recommendation (global rating scale):3
Total: 3+3=6; +3=9; +3=12; +2=14; +3=17; +3=20. So 20.

**Respondent 3:**
- Identification:0
- Situation:2
- Background (history):3
- Background (examination):3
- Assessment:3
- Recommendation (clear recommendation):3
- Recommendation (global rating scale):3
Total: 0+2=2; +3=5; +3=8; +3=11; +3=14; +3=17. So 17.

**Respondent 14:**
- Identification:3
- Situation:3
- Background (history):2
- Background (examination):2
- Assessment:3
- Recommendation (clear recommendation):1
- Recommendation (global rating scale):2
Total: 3+3=6; +2=8; +2=10; +3=13; +1=14; +2=16. So 16.

**Respondent 16:**
- Identification:3
- Situation:3
- Background (history):3
- Background (examination):3
- Assessment:3
- Recommendation (clear recommendation):2
- Recommendation (global rating scale):3
Total: 3+3=6; +3=9; +3=12; +3=15; +2=17; +3=20. So 20.

**Respondent 2:**
- Identification:3
- Situation:3
- Background (history):2
- Background (examination):3
- Assessment:3
- Recommendation (clear recommendation):2
- Recommendation (global rating scale):1
Total: 3+3=6; +2=8; +3=11; +3=14; +2=16; +1=17. So 17.

**Respondent 4:**
- Identification:3
- Situation:3
- Background (history):3
- Background (examination):2
- Assessment:2
- Recommendation (clear recommendation):2
- Recommendation (global rating scale):2
Total: 3+3=6; +3=9; +2=11; +2=13; +2=15; +2=17. So 17.

Now, compiling all total scores:

- Respondent 1: 12
- Respondent 11: 21
- Respondent 6: 18
- Respondent 20: 15
- Respondent 15: 17
- Respondent 12: 20
- Respondent 3: 17
- Respondent 14: 16
- Respondent 16: 20
- Respondent 2: 17
- Respondent 4: 17

Wait, wait, the list of respondents in the data is:

Respondent 1, 11, 6, 20, 15, 12, 3, 14, 16, 2, 4. That's 11 respondents. Let me check if I have all 11 totals:

Yes, 11 totals. Now, let's list them all:

1. 12
2. 21
3. 18
4. 15
5. 17
6. 20
7. 17
8. 16
9. 20
10. 17 (Respondent 2)
11. 17 (Respondent 4)

Now, compute the average total score.

Sum all these totals:

12 + 21 = 33

33 +18=51

51 +15=66

66 +17=83

83 +20=103

103 +17=120

120 +16=136

136 +20=156

156 +17=173 (Respondent 2)

173 +17=190 (Respondent 4)

Total sum is 190.

Number of respondents: 11.

Average total score = 190 / 11 ≈ 17.27.

So the average is approximately 17.27.

Now, the next step is to find all respondents whose comments include 'Satisfactory' and have a total score below 17.27.

First, identify which respondents have 'Satisfactory' in their comments.

Looking at each respondent's comments:

- Respondent 1: Comments: ""Satisfactory"" → contains 'Satisfactory'.
- Respondent 11: Comments: ""Clear communication and handover"" → no.
- Respondent 6: Comments: (empty) → no.
- Respondent 20: Comments: ""Good"" → no.
- Respondent 15: Comments: ""Detailed Response - clear communication"" → no. Wait, the comment is ""Detailed Response - clear communication"". No 'Satisfactory' here.
Wait, let me check again:

Respondent 15's Comments: ""Detailed Response - clear communication"" – no 'Satisfactory'.

Respondent 12: Comments: ""Good"" → no.

Respondent 3: Comments: ""The patient/simulation is not oriented in TPP. Clear communication between Reg and colleague during handover"" → no 'Satisfactory'.

Respondent 14: Comments: ""Time: (2:36-2:53) Late response for considering consultation"" → no.

Respondent 16: Comments: ""Consent denied for video recordings Satisfactory"" → contains 'Satisfactory'.

Respondent 2: Comments: (empty) → no.

Respondent 4: Comments: ""Clinical handover and communication skills, satisfactory No panic, no arrest team Satisfactory"" → contains 'satisfactory' (lowercase?), but in the data, it's written as ""satisfactory""? Wait, looking at the data:

Respondent 4's Comments: ""Clinical handover and communication skills, satisfactory No panic, no arrest team Satisfactory""

So the comments have 'satisfactory' (lowercase 's') and 'Satisfactory' (capital 'S'). The problem says ""comments contain 'Satisfactory'"". The search is case-sensitive? The problem says ""contain 'Satisfactory'"", which is with a capital S. So in Respondent 4's comments, there's ""Satisfactory"" at the end. So yes, that's a match. Also, the first 'satisfactory' is lowercase, but the second is 'Satisfactory'. So Respondent 4's comments do contain 'Satisfactory'.

So the respondents with 'Satisfactory' in comments are:

- Respondent 1: Yes
- Respondent 16: Yes
- Respondent 4: Yes

Wait, let's check each:

Respondent 1: Comments: ""Satisfactory"" → yes.

Respondent 16: Comments: ""Consent denied for video recordings
Satisfactory"" → 'Satisfactory' is present.

Respondent 4: Comments: ""Clinical handover and communication skills, satisfactory No panic, no arrest team
Satisfactory"" → 'Satisfactory' is present (the last word). The first 'satisfactory' is lowercase, but the last is 'Satisfactory' with a capital S. So yes, it's included.

Any others?

Respondent 3's comments: No.

Respondent 14: No.

Respondent 15: No.

So total three respondents: 1, 16, 4.

Now, check their total scores:

- Respondent 1: 12 → which is below 17.27 → yes.
- Respondent 16: 20 → which is above 17.27 → no.
- Respondent 4: 17 → which is 17, which is slightly below 17.27? Wait, 17 is less than 17.27? Yes, because 17.27 is approximately 17.27, so 17 is below.

So respondents 1 and 4 have total scores below the average. Respondent 16's score is 20, which is above.

Wait, let me confirm the average again. Total sum is 190, divided by 11 respondents: 190 / 11 = 17.2727... So approximately 17.27. So 17 is below that, and 20 is above.

So among the three respondents with 'Satisfactory' in comments, two (1 and 4) have total scores below the average. Respondent 4's total is 17, which is below 17.27.

Wait, but Respondent 4's total is 17. Let me check:

Respondent 4's total: 3 (Id) +3 (Sit) +3 (hist) +2 (exam) +2 (assess) +2 (rec) +2 (GRS) = 3+3=6, +3=9, +2=11, +2=13, +2=15, +2=17. Yes, 17.

So 17 is less than 17.27, so it's below average.

Respondent 1: 12 (below), Respondent 4: 17 (below), Respondent 16: 20 (above). So two respondents meet the criteria.

Wait, but let me check again. The three respondents with 'Satisfactory' in comments are 1, 16, and 4. Their scores are 12, 20, and 17. The average is ~17.27. So 12 and 17 are below, 20 is above. So two respondents.

Therefore, the answer should be 2.
