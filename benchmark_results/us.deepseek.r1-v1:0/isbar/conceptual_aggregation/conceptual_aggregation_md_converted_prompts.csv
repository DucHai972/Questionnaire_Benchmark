<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents participated in a 'IV - VT' session?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question. The task is to find out how many respondents participated in a session named 'IV - VT'. 

First, I need to look through all the responses and check the 'SessionName' field for each respondent. The key here is to match the exact session name as given in the question, which is 'IV - VT'. But I should also be cautious about possible variations in the session names that might still refer to the same session.

Looking at the data provided, each respondent has a 'SessionName' entry. Let me go through each one:

- Respondent 1: SessionName is ""V (Hypoglycemia)"" – not IV - VT.
- Respondent 5: ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" – nope.
- Respondent 14: ""IV-Hypoglycemia"" – IV but different topic.
- Respondent 22: ""IV (VT)"" – This has IV and VT, but written as ""IV (VT)"". The question is about ""IV - VT"". The hyphen vs. parentheses might be a variation. Need to check if these are considered the same.
- Respondent 3: ""III-Sepsis"" – different.
- Respondent 16: ""I - MI"" – different.
- Respondent 9: ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"" – no.
- Respondent 11: ""IV (AF)"" – IV but AF instead of VT.
- Respondent 10: ""(MI)-VT"" – MI and VT, but not IV.
- Respondent 12: ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" – no.
- Respondent 7: ""III-Sepsis"" – different.
- Respondent 18: ""IV - VT"" – This exactly matches the session name in the question.

So, Respondent 18's SessionName is ""IV - VT"", which is an exact match. Respondent 22 has ""IV (VT)"", which might be the same session but formatted differently. However, the question specifically asks for 'IV - VT', so I need to check if these are considered the same. 

Looking at the data, the hyphen and parentheses might just be formatting differences. For example, in the example provided in the problem, the answer was 2 for 'I - MI' session. In the example data, Respondent 16 has ""I - MI"" and Respondent 10 has ""(MI)-VT"". The example answer counted only Respondent 16. So, the exact match is required. Therefore, in this case, only Respondent 18 has ""IV - VT"" exactly. Respondent 22's ""IV (VT)"" is a different format and might be a different session. 

Therefore, the count is 1.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

How many respondents who scored 2 on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' also have 'Comments' that contain the word 'reflected'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find out how many respondents scored 2 on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and also have 'Comments' that include the word 'reflected'. 

First, I need to go through each respondent's data. Let me start by looking at the 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' field for each. The question specifies that we need respondents who scored exactly 2 here. 

Looking at the responses:

- Respondent 9: Recommendation (clear recommendation) is 3. So, skip.
- Respondent 7: Score 2. Check comments: ""Time: (1:00-1:17)"". No 'reflected' here.
- Respondent 4: Score 2. Comments mention ""Clinical handover..."", no 'reflected'.
- Respondent 15: Score 2. Comments: ""Detailed Response - clear communication"". No 'reflected'.
- Respondent 3: Score 3. Skip.
- Respondent 22: Score 2. Comments: ""Clear communication skills Good"". No 'reflected'.
- Respondent 1: Score 2. Comments: ""Satisfactory"". No 'reflected'.
- Respondent 2: Score 2. Comments are empty. Skip.
- Respondent 13: Score 2. Comments mention ""Lack of communication..."", no 'reflected'.
- Respondent 6: Score 2. Comments are empty. Skip.
- Respondent 21: Score 3. Skip.

Now, among those with score 2, check their 'Comments' for the word 'reflected'. The only one with 'reflected' in comments is Respondent 9, but their score was 3, so they don't count. Wait, no. Wait, Respondent 9's comment is ""Overall a bit unclear communication reflected"". But their 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' is 3, so they don't meet the score 2 requirement. 

Wait, did I miss any? Let me check again. All respondents with score 2 in 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' are 7,4,15,22,1,2,13,6. Wait, no. Let me list them properly:

Looking at each respondent:

- Respondent 7: Score 2. Comments: No 'reflected'.
- Respondent 4: Score 2. Comments: No.
- Respondent 15: Score 2. No.
- Respondent 22: Score 2. No.
- Respondent 1: Score 2. No.
- Respondent 2: Score 2. No comments.
- Respondent 13: Score 2. No.
- Respondent 6: Score 2. No comments.

Wait, actually, the only comment with 'reflected' is Respondent 9, but their score is 3. So none of the respondents with score 2 have 'reflected' in their comments. Therefore, the answer should be 0. But wait, let me double-check. Did I miss any?

Wait, Respondent 9's comment is ""Overall a bit unclear communication reflected"". The word 'reflected' is there. But their 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' is 3, not 2. So they don't meet both criteria. Therefore, the count is zero. But wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check all the comments again for the word 'reflected':

Looking through all comments:

- Respondent 9: ""reflected"" is present. But their score is 3.
- Others: No. So no one with score 2 has 'reflected' in comments. So the answer is 0.

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the number of respondents where the sum of their 'Background (examination)' score and 'Assessment' score is greater than 5. 

First, I need to look at each respondent's data. Let's go through each one listed in the responses.

Starting with Respondent 19. Their Background (examination) is 3 and Assessment is 2. Adding those gives 5. But 5 is not greater than 5, so this one doesn't count.

Next, Respondent 7. Background (examination) is 3 and Assessment is 2. That's also 5. Again, not greater than 5. So skip.

Respondent 3: Background (examination) is 3, Assessment is 3. 3+3=6. That's greater than 5. So this counts. That's one.

Respondent 18: Background (examination) is 2, Assessment is 3. 2+3=5. Doesn't meet the condition. Skip.

Respondent 22: Background (examination) is 3, Assessment is 2. 3+2=5. No good.

Respondent 23: Background (examination) is 2, Assessment is 3. 2+3=5. Doesn't qualify.

Respondent 8: Background (examination) is 2, Assessment is 2. 2+2=4. Also below.

So, only Respondent 3 has a total of 6, which is greater than 5. Therefore, the count is 1.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents from the 'II (Anaphylaxsis)' session scored 3 on 'Situation' and 2 on 'Assessment'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find out how many respondents from the 'II (Anaphylaxsis)' session scored 3 on 'Situation' and 2 on 'Assessment'. 

First, I need to go through each respondent's data and check their SessionName, Situation score, and Assessment score. 

Starting with Respondent 5: Their SessionName is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"". The question specifies ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"", but the format here uses a hyphen instead of parentheses. However, the session name seems to be the same topic, just different formatting. So maybe variations like ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" and ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"" should be considered the same. The Situation is 3, and Assessment is 3. So this doesn't meet the Assessment score of 2.

Respondent 20: SessionName is ""IV (VT)"", so not relevant.

Respondent 1: SessionName is ""V (Hypoglycemia)"", so skip.

Respondent 9: SessionName is ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"". Situation is 3, Assessment is 2. This matches both criteria. So count 1.

Respondent 23: SessionName is ""II-Anaphylaxsis"". Again, different punctuation but same session. Situation is 3, Assessment is 3. Doesn't meet the Assessment score.

Respondent 19: SessionName is ""I - MI"", not relevant.

Respondent 22: SessionName is ""IV (VT)"", skip.

Respondent 6: SessionName is ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"". The name is slightly different, so maybe a different session. So probably not included.

Respondent 2: SessionName is ""MI"", not relevant.

Respondent 11: SessionName is ""IV (AF)"", skip.

So checking again, only Respondent 9 has SessionName ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"" with Situation 3 and Assessment 2. But wait, let me check again. Are there any others?

Wait, Respondent 5's SessionName is ""II - Anaphylaxsis"". If the session name is considered the same as ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"", then we need to check if their Situation and Assessment scores match. Respondent 5's Situation is 3, Assessment is 3. So no. 

Respondent 23's SessionName is ""II-Anaphylaxsis"". If that's considered the same, their Situation is 3, Assessment is 3. So no. 

Respondent 6's SessionName is ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"", which is a different name, so not included. 

So the only one that matches is Respondent 9. Therefore, the answer should be 1.

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and 'Situation' is greater than 5.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the number of respondents whose total score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and 'Situation' is greater than 5. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and 'Situation' are both rubric-based questions with scores from 0 to 3. The total of these two scores needs to be greater than 5. Since each can be up to 3, the maximum possible sum is 6 (3+3). So, a sum greater than 5 means the sum must be exactly 6.

Now, I'll go through each respondent and calculate their scores for these two fields.

Starting with Respondent 5:
- Recommendation (clear recommendation): 2
- Situation: 3
Sum: 2 + 3 = 5. Not greater than 5. So, exclude.

Respondent 1:
- Recommendation: 2
- Situation: 2
Sum: 4. Exclude.

Respondent 12:
- Recommendation: 3
- Situation: 3
Sum: 6. This is greater than 5. Include.

Respondent 8:
- Recommendation: 2
- Situation: 3
Sum: 5. Exclude.

Respondent 19:
- Recommendation: 3
- Situation: 3
Sum: 6. Include.

So, respondents 12 and 19 meet the criteria. That's a total of 2 respondents.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".

<task>
How many respondents from the 'II (Anaphylactic Shock)' session scored 3 on 'Background (examination)' and 2 on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find out how many respondents from the 'II (Anaphylactic Shock)' session scored 3 on 'Background (examination)' and 2 on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)'. 

First, I need to go through each respondent in the data and check if they meet all the criteria. Let's start by identifying which respondents are part of the 'II (Anaphylactic Shock)' session. 

Looking at the SessionName for each respondent:

- Respondent 6 has SessionName: II (Anaphylactic Shock)
- Respondent 9: II (Anaphylaxsis)
- Respondent 5: II - Anaphylaxsis
- Respondent 12: II (Anaphylaxis)

Wait, the session names have variations. The target is 'II (Anaphylactic Shock)', so I need to check exact matches. Let's see:

- Respondent 6's SessionName is exactly ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"". The others have ""Anaphylaxsis"" or ""Anaphylaxis"", which might be typos but are different from ""Anaphylactic Shock"". So only Respondent 6 is in the exact session specified.

Now, check Respondent 6's scores. For 'Background (examination)', they have a 3. For 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)', they have a 2. That meets both criteria. 

Are there any other respondents in the session? Let me double-check. The other respondents with ""II"" in their SessionName are 9, 5, and 12, but their session names are variations of Anaphylaxis, not Anaphylactic Shock. So they don't count. 

Therefore, only Respondent 6 fits both the session name and the required scores. The answer should be 1.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents who scored 2 on 'Background (examination)' also have 'Comments' that contain the word 'communication'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking: How many respondents who scored 2 on 'Background (examination)' also have 'Comments' that contain the word 'communication'?

First, I need to go through each respondent in the data and check two things: their score for 'Background (examination)' and whether their 'Comments' include the word 'communication'. 

Starting with the list of respondents:

1. **Respondent 15**: Background (examination) is 3. So, this doesn't meet the score of 2. Move on.
2. **Respondent 12**: Background (examination) is 3. Not 2. Skip.
3. **Respondent 17**: Score is 3. Next.
4. **Respondent 19**: Score is 3. Not relevant.
5. **Respondent 4**: Background (examination) is 2. Now check the comments. The comments are: ""Clinical handover and communication skills, satisfactory. No panic, no arrest team. Satisfactory."" The word 'communication' is present. So this counts.
6. **Respondent 23**: Score is 2. Comments: ""Talking to registrav could not summarize the condition of patient very clearly. DID: Sepsis I Anaphylaxsis given by team."" No mention of 'communication'. So no.
7. **Respondent 21**: Score is 1. Doesn't meet the 2. Skip.
8. **Respondent 8**: Score is 2. Comments: ""Clear communication during handover. Good."" Here, 'communication' is present. So this counts.
9. **Respondent 10**: Score is 2. Comments: ""Time: (15:53-16:14)"". No 'communication' here.
10. **Respondent 1**: Score is 2. Comments: ""Satisfactory."" No 'communication'.
11. **Respondent 22**: Score is 3. Not applicable.

So, the respondents with a score of 2 in Background (examination) are Respondent 4, 8, 10, 1. Wait, wait. Wait, let me check again. 

Wait, Respondent 4: Background (examination) is 2. Correct. Respondent 8: 2. Correct. Respondent 10: Background (examination) is 2. Yes. Respondent 1: Background (examination) is 2. Wait, looking back:

Wait, Respondent 1's Background (examination) is 2? Let me check. 

Looking at Respondent 1's data: 

- **Background (examination):** 2. Yes. So that's four respondents with score 2. But wait, the task is to find those with score 2 AND comments containing 'communication'. 

So among these four (4,8,10,1), check their comments:

- Respondent 4: Comments include 'communication' (yes)
- Respondent 8: Comments include 'communication' (yes)
- Respondent 10: Comments don't have 'communication'
- Respondent 1: Comments don't have 'communication'

So that's two respondents: 4 and 8. 

Wait, but let me confirm each one again:

Respondent 4: Comments: ""Clinical handover and communication skills, satisfactory..."" Yes, 'communication' is there.

Respondent 8: Comments: ""Clear communication during handover..."" Yes.

Respondent 10: Comments: Just a time. No.

Respondent 1: Comments: ""Satisfactory."" No.

So total of 2 respondents meet both criteria. Therefore, the answer should be 2.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents who scored 3 on 'Background (examination)' also have 'Comments' that contain the word 'reflected'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find out how many respondents scored 3 on 'Background (examination)' and also have the word 'reflected' in their comments. 

First, I need to go through each respondent's data. Let me start by looking at the 'Background (examination)' scores. The rubric says a 3 means ""Comprehensive focused examination/observations."" So I need to filter all respondents who have a 3 in that category.

Looking at the responses:

- Respondent 10: Background (examination) is 2. Not 3.
- Respondent 15: 3 here. So check their comments. Their comment is ""Detailed Response - clear communication."" No 'reflected' here.
- Respondent 21: 1. Not applicable.
- Respondent 1: 2. No.
- Respondent 2: 3. Check comments: The comment is empty. So no.
- Respondent 16: 3. Comments: ""Consent denied for video recordings Satisfactory."" No 'reflected'.
- Respondent 13: 1. Not 3.
- Respondent 14: 2. No.
- Respondent 11: 3. Comments: ""Clear communication and handover."" No 'reflected'.
- Respondent 19: 3. Comments mention ""Wrong CPR position Clarity is a bit low over whole case scenario Satisfactory."" Still no 'reflected'.
- Respondent 8: 2. Not 3.
- Respondent 12: 3. Comments: ""Good."" No 'reflected'.

Wait, so the respondents with 'Background (examination)' score 3 are 15, 2, 16, 11, 19, and 12. Let me double-check:

- Respondent 15: 3
- Respondent 2: 3
- Respondent 16: 3
- Respondent 11: 3
- Respondent 19: 3
- Respondent 12: 3

That's six respondents. Now, check each of their comments for the word 'reflected'. 

Looking at each comment again:

- 15: ""Detailed Response - clear communication"" → No.
- 2: No comment. → No.
- 16: ""Consent denied for video recordings Satisfactory"" → No.
- 11: ""Clear communication and handover"" → No.
- 19: ""Wrong CPR position Clarity is a bit low over whole case scenario Satisfactory"" → No.
- 12: ""Good"" → No.

None of these comments include the word 'reflected'. So the count should be zero. But wait, maybe I missed someone. Let me check all comments again in case I overlooked. 

Wait, the task says ""Comments that contain the word 'reflected'"". Let me scan all comments again for any occurrence. 

Looking through all respondents, not just those with 3 in Background (examination):

- Respondent 10: Time: (15:53-16:14) → No.
- Respondent 15: ""Detailed Response - clear communication"" → No.
- Respondent 21: ""Diagnostic clarity is present Good and early assessment of condition is done"" → No.
- Respondent 1: ""Satisfactory"" → No.
- Respondent 2: (empty) → No.
- Respondent 16: ""Consent denied for video recordings Satisfactory"" → No.
- Respondent 13: ""Time: (10:29-10:54) Ventricular fibrillation (CVS) Lack of communication btween 2 main interns Further brief to patient, ask patent concerns"" → 'communication' but not 'reflected'.
- Respondent 14: ""Time: (2:36-2:53) Late response for considering consultation"" → No.
- Respondent 11: ""Clear communication and handover"" → No.
- Respondent 19: ""Wrong CPR position Clarity is a bit low over whole case scenario Satisfactory"" → No.
- Respondent 8: ""Clear communication during handover Good"" → No.
- Respondent 12: ""Good"" → No.

None of the comments have the word 'reflected'. Therefore, even though there are six respondents with a score of 3 in Background (examination), none of their comments include 'reflected'. So the answer is 0.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and 'Background (history)' is greater than 5.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the number of respondents whose total score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and 'Background (history)' is greater than 5. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and 'Background (history)' are both rubric-based questions with scores from 0 to 3. The sum of these two scores needs to be greater than 5. Since each can be up to 3, the maximum possible sum is 6. So, to get a sum greater than 5, the sum must be exactly 6. That means both scores need to be 3 each because 3 + 3 = 6. If either is less than 3, the sum would be 5 or lower.

Now, I'll go through each respondent and check their scores for these two fields.

Starting with Respondent 3:
- Background (history): 3
- Recommendation (clear recommendation): 3
Sum: 6. So this counts.

Respondent 23:
- Background (history): 2
- Recommendation: 3
Sum: 5. Doesn't meet the criteria.

Respondent 11:
- Both are 3. Sum 6. Counts.

Respondent 20:
- Background (history): 2
- Recommendation: 2
Sum: 4. No.

Respondent 5:
- Background: 3
- Recommendation: 2
Sum: 5. No.

Respondent 22:
- Background: 3
- Recommendation: 2
Sum: 5. No.

Respondent 19:
- Background: 3
- Recommendation: 3
Sum: 6. Counts.

Respondent 9:
- Background: 2
- Recommendation: 3
Sum: 5. No.

Respondent 10:
- Both are 2. Sum 4. No.

Respondent 21:
- Background: 3
- Recommendation: 3
Sum: 6. Counts.

Respondent 15:
- Background: 2
- Recommendation: 2
Sum: 4. No.

So, the respondents who meet the criteria are 3, 11, 19, 21. That's four respondents. Wait, let me double-check:

Respondent 3: 3+3=6 ✅
Respondent 11: 3+3=6 ✅
Respondent 19: 3+3=6 ✅
Respondent 21: 3+3=6 ✅

Yes, four respondents. But wait, the example answer given was 2, but that was for a different question. In this case, the correct count here is 4. Let me check again to make sure I didn't miss any.

Wait, looking back:

Respondent 3: 3 and 3 → 6
Respondent 11: 3 and 3 → 6
Respondent 19: 3 and 3 → 6
Respondent 21: 3 and 3 → 6

Yes, four respondents. But wait, let me check all again to be sure.

Wait, Respondent 5: Background is 3, Recommendation is 2. Sum 5. No.

Respondent 15: Background 2, Recommendation 2. Sum 4. No.

Others: Correct. So total of 4. But the example answer was 2 for a different question, but here the answer should be 4. Unless I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, let me check each one again:

Respondent 3: 3 +3=6 ✅
Respondent 23: 2+3=5 ❌
Respondent 11:3+3=6 ✅
Respondent 20:2+2=4 ❌
Respondent5:3+2=5 ❌
Respondent22:3+2=5 ❌
Respondent19:3+3=6 ✅
Respondent9:2+3=5 ❌
Respondent10:2+2=4 ❌
Respondent21:3+3=6 ✅
Respondent15:2+2=4 ❌

Yes, that's four. So the answer should be 4. But wait, the example answer was 2, but that was for a different question. So in this case, the correct answer is 4.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents from the '(MI)-VT' session scored 2 on 'Assessment' and 2 on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find out how many respondents from the '(MI)-VT' session scored 2 on 'Assessment' and 2 on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)'. 

First, I need to look through all the responses and identify which ones have the SessionName '(MI)-VT'. Let me go through each respondent one by one.

Starting with Respondent 23: Their SessionName is II-Anaphylaxsis. Not the one we're looking for. 

Respondent 11: SessionName is IV (AF). Nope. 

Respondent 13: I-VF. Not matching. 

Respondent 20: IV (VT). Still not. 

Respondent 17: V (Hypoglycemia). No. 

Respondent 10: Here's the SessionName '(MI)-VT'. That's the one we need. Now check their Assessment and Recommendation (clear recommendation) scores. Assessment is 2, and Recommendation (clear recommendation) is 2. So this respondent meets both criteria. 

Moving on to Respondent 15: III - Sepsis. Not relevant. 

Respondent 14: IV-Hypoglycemia. No. 

Respondent 2: SessionName is MI. Close, but the exact session name is MI, not (MI)-VT. So this doesn't count. 

Respondent 21: I (Myocardial infarction). Not matching. 

Respondent 12: II (Anaphylaxis). No. 

Respondent 19: I - MI. Again, different session name. 

So the only respondent that fits the '(MI)-VT' session is Respondent 10. They scored 2 on both Assessment and Recommendation (clear recommendation). Therefore, the count is 1.

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").

<task>
How many respondents from the 'I-VF' session scored 2 on 'Assessment' and 3 on 'Situation'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find out how many respondents from the 'I-VF' session scored 2 on 'Assessment' and 3 on 'Situation'. 

First, I need to look through all the responses and identify which ones are part of the 'I-VF' session. The SessionName field will tell me that. Let me go through each respondent one by one.

Starting with Respondent 7: SessionName is III-Sepsis. Not I-VF. Next, Respondent 14: IV-Hypoglycemia. Still not. Respondent 15: III - Sepsis. Nope. Respondent 8: III (Sepsis). Not matching. Respondent 22: IV (VT). No. Respondent 11: IV (AF). Not it. Respondent 21: I (Myocardial infarction). Close, but the session name is different. 

Ah, Respondent 13: SessionName is I-VF. That's the one we're looking for. Now, check their scores. Situation is 3, Assessment is 2. So that's a match. 

Are there any other respondents with SessionName I-VF? Let me check the rest. Respondent 23: II-Anaphylaxsis. Respondent 12: II (Anaphylaxis). Respondent 2: MI. Respondent 6: II (Anaphylactic Shock). No others have I-VF. 

So only Respondent 13 meets both criteria. Therefore, the answer should be 1.

<task>
How many respondents who scored 2 on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' also have 'Comments' that contain the word 'unclear'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find out how many respondents scored a 2 on the 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and also have 'Comments' that include the word 'unclear'. 

First, I need to look through all the respondents in the data provided. Let me go through each respondent one by one.

Starting with Respondent 11: Their 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is 3, which is above 2, so they don't qualify. Their comments mention ""Clear communication"", so even if the score was 2, the comment doesn't have 'unclear'. So, skip.

Respondent 22: The GRS is 3 again. Comments say ""Clear communication skills"" and ""Good"". No 'unclear' here. Not relevant.

Respondent 9: GRS is 2. Now check the comments: ""Overall a bit unclear communication reflected"". The word 'unclear' is present. So this one counts. That's one.

Respondent 12: GRS is 3. Comments are ""Good"". Doesn't meet the score or the comment. Skip.

Respondent 5: GRS is 3. Comments mention ""Good clear and precise..."", so no. Next.

Respondent 16: GRS is 3. Comments about consent, not 'unclear'. Not applicable.

Respondent 3: GRS is 3. Comments are about TPP orientation and clear communication. No 'unclear'.

Respondent 17: GRS is 2. Comments: ""Concise - clear"" and ""Satisfactory"". The word 'unclear' isn't here. So even though the score is 2, the comment doesn't have the keyword. So this doesn't count.

Respondent 14: GRS is 2. Comments mention ""Late response for considering consultation"". No 'unclear' here. So no.

Respondent 2: GRS is 1. So score is below 2. Comments are empty. Doesn't qualify.

Respondent 15: GRS is 2. Comments: ""Detailed Response - clear communication"". The word 'unclear' isn't present. So this one doesn't count either.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents from the 'IV - VT' session scored 2 on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 3 on 'Situation'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find out how many respondents from the 'IV - VT' session scored 2 on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 3 on 'Situation'. 

First, I need to go through each respondent in the data and check their SessionName. The session we're interested in is 'IV - VT'. But I should also look for variations in the naming, like maybe 'IV (VT)' or 'IV-VT' since sometimes data entry can have inconsistencies.

Looking at the responses:

- Respondent 18 has SessionName: IV - VT. That's a direct match. Let's check their scores. Their 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is 2, and 'Situation' is 3. So this one counts.

- Respondent 20's SessionName is IV (VT). That's another variation. Their 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is 3, and 'Situation' is 3. The GRS here is 3, which doesn't meet the requirement of 2, so this one doesn't count.

Other respondents with SessionName IV (AF) or V (Hypoglycemia) are not relevant here. 

So, only Respondent 18 fits both criteria. Therefore, the answer should be 1.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 'Assessment' is greater than 5.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the number of respondents where the sum of their 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 'Assessment' scores is greater than 5. 

First, I need to make sure I understand the data structure. The 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 'Assessment' are two separate fields in each respondent's data. Each of these fields has a rubric with scores from 0 to 3. So the maximum possible sum for these two would be 3 + 3 = 6. The question is asking for respondents where this sum is greater than 5, which means the sum has to be 6.

Now, I'll go through each respondent one by one and calculate their scores for these two fields.

Starting with Respondent 2:
- Recommendation (global rating scale): 1
- Assessment: 3
Sum: 1 + 3 = 4 → Not greater than 5.

Respondent 10:
- GRS: 2
- Assessment: 2
Sum: 4 → No.

Respondent 20:
- GRS: 3
- Assessment: 3
Sum: 6 → Yes. This counts.

Respondent 22:
- GRS: 3
- Assessment: 2
Sum: 5 → No.

Respondent 12:
- GRS: 3
- Assessment: 2
Sum: 5 → No.

Respondent 4:
- GRS: 2
- Assessment: 2
Sum: 4 → No.

Respondent 17:
- GRS: 2
- Assessment: 3
Sum: 5 → No.

Respondent 7:
- GRS: 2
- Assessment: 2
Sum: 4 → No.

Respondent 3:
- GRS: 3
- Assessment: 3
Sum: 6 → Yes. Counts.

Respondent 11:
- GRS: 3
- Assessment: 3
Sum: 6 → Yes. Counts.

Respondent 8:
- GRS: 3
- Assessment: 2
Sum: 5 → No.

So, the respondents who meet the criteria are 20, 3, and 11. That's a total of 3 respondents.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents from the 'II (Anaphylaxis)' session scored 3 on 'Background (examination)' and 3 on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The task is to find out how many respondents from the 'II (Anaphylaxis)' session scored 3 on both 'Background (examination)' and 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)'. 

First, I need to identify all respondents who participated in the session named 'II (Anaphylaxis)'. The session names can vary slightly, so I should check for variations like different spellings or formatting. For example, the example in the data shows ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" and ""II-Anaphylaxsis"". The user's question specifies 'II (Anaphylaxis)', but I should consider possible variations in the data.

Looking at the responses:

- Respondent 12 has SessionName: II (Anaphylaxis)
- Respondent 23: II-Anaphylaxsis
- Respondent 9: II (Anaphylaxsis)

Wait, the question is about 'II (Anaphylaxis)', so I need to check if these variations are considered the same. The key part is ""Anaphylaxis"" vs. ""Anaphylaxsis"". The correct medical term is ""Anaphylaxis"", but there might be a typo in the data. For example, Respondent 23's session is ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" which might be a misspelling. Similarly, Respondent 9's session is ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"". The question uses the correct spelling, so I should check if the data entries with ""Anaphylaxsis"" are considered part of the same session. However, the user's task specifically mentions 'II (Anaphylaxis)', so perhaps only Respondent 12 is in that exact session. But maybe the others are typos and should be considered the same. Let me check the example given in the initial data. In the example, the answer was 2 for 'I - MI' session, and in the data, Respondent 16 is the only one with 'I - MI', but the answer was 2. Wait, that's conflicting. Wait, in the example, the answer was 2, but in the data provided, only Respondent 16 has 'I - MI'. Hmm, maybe there was a typo in the example. But perhaps in the actual data here, the task is different. Let's focus on the current task.

The current task is to count respondents in 'II (Anaphylaxis)' session. Let's look at all respondents:

- Respondent 12: SessionName: II (Anaphylaxis)
- Respondent 23: II-Anaphylaxsis
- Respondent 9: II (Anaphylaxsis)
- Any others? Let's check all:

Respondent 4: III (Sepsis)
Respondent 12: II (Anaphylaxis)
Respondent 18: IV - VT
Respondent 22: IV (VT)
Respondent 23: II-Anaphylaxsis
Respondent 9: II (Anaphylaxsis)
Respondent 8: III (Sepsis)
Respondent 14: IV-Hypoglycemia
Respondent 16: I - MI

So, the sessions related to Anaphylaxis are Respondents 12, 23, and 9. But their session names have variations. The question uses 'II (Anaphylaxis)', so perhaps only Respondent 12 is exact. However, in the example, the answer considered 'I - MI' as the session, and in the data, Respondent 16 is the only one with that exact name, but the example answer was 2. That suggests that maybe there's a typo in the example, but perhaps in the current data, the user expects that variations like ""Anaphylaxsis"" are considered the same as ""Anaphylaxis"". Alternatively, maybe the session is ""II"" with different topics. Wait, the session names might have a numbering (I, II, III, IV) followed by the topic. So ""II (Anaphylaxis)"", ""II-Anaphylaxsis"", and ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"" are all Session II with Anaphylaxis, possibly with a typo in the spelling. So perhaps all three respondents (12, 23, 9) are part of Session II Anaphylaxis, despite the spelling differences. But the user's question specifically says 'II (Anaphylaxis)', so maybe only Respondent 12 is correct. However, in the example, the answer was 2 for 'I - MI' session, but in the data provided, only Respondent 16 is in that session. That suggests that perhaps the example had a typo, but in the current task, we need to be precise.

Alternatively, maybe the session name is case-insensitive or allows for hyphens vs. parentheses. Let's check the exact session names:

- Respondent 12: ""II (Anaphylaxis)""
- Respondent 23: ""II-Anaphylaxsis""
- Respondent 9: ""II (Anaphylaxsis)""

The user's question is about ""II (Anaphylaxis)"". The difference is the spelling of Anaphylaxis (with an 's') vs. Anaphylaxsis (with 'ssis'). That's a possible typo. For example, ""Anaphylaxsis"" is a misspelling of ""Anaphylaxis"". If we consider that, then Respondents 12, 23, and 9 are all in Session II Anaphylaxis, but with a typo in the name. However, the user's question uses the correct spelling, so perhaps only Respondent 12 is correct. But maybe the data has a typo, and all three are intended to be part of the same session. This is a bit ambiguous, but as a meticulous analyst, I should note the exact matches. However, in the example, the answer was 2 for 'I - MI' session, but in the data provided, only Respondent 16 is in that session. That suggests that perhaps the example had a mistake, but in the current data, we need to be precise.

Alternatively, maybe the session name is considered the same if the main identifier (II) and the topic (Anaphylaxis) are the same, regardless of formatting. For example, ""II (Anaphylaxis)"", ""II-Anaphylaxsis"", and ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"" are all considered Session II Anaphylaxis. If that's the case, then Respondents 12, 23, and 9 are all part of Session II Anaphylaxis. But the spelling of Anaphylaxsis vs. Anaphylaxis is different. However, in the medical context, Anaphylaxis is the correct term, and Anaphylaxsis is a misspelling. So perhaps Respondents 23 and 9 are in a different session, but that's unlikely. It's possible that the session name was intended to be Anaphylaxis, and the variations are typos. Therefore, we might consider all three respondents (12, 23, 9) as part of the same session. However, the user's question specifies 'II (Anaphylaxis)', which exactly matches Respondent 12. The others have different session names. Therefore, only Respondent 12 is in the exact session as per the question.

But let's check the data again. Respondent 23's SessionName is ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" and Respondent 9's is ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"". The question is about ""II (Anaphylaxis)"". The difference is the spelling of the condition. If the user is strict about the exact session name, then only Respondent 12 matches. However, if the user considers that ""Anaphylaxsis"" is a typo and should be ""Anaphylaxis"", then all three would be included. But as a data analyst, I should not assume typos unless instructed. Therefore, the correct approach is to match the exact session name as given in the data. Therefore, only Respondent 12 is in ""II (Anaphylaxis)"".

Now, among the respondents in ""II (Anaphylaxis)"", we need to check their scores for 'Background (examination)' and 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)'. 

Looking at Respondent 12:
- Background (examination): 3
- Recommendation (clear recommendation): 3

So this respondent meets both criteria.

If there are other respondents in ""II (Anaphylaxis)"", but based on the session name, only Respondent 12 is in that exact session. Therefore, the count is 1.

Wait, but earlier I thought that maybe the other respondents (23 and 9) might be part of the same session but with typos. Let's check their data:

Respondent 23:
- SessionName: II-Anaphylaxsis
- Background (examination): 2
- Recommendation (clear recommendation): 3

So even if we consider this session as part of II (Anaphylaxis), their Background (examination) is 2, which doesn't meet the criteria of 3. So even if included, they wouldn't count.

Respondent 9:
- SessionName: II (Anaphylaxsis)
- Background (examination): 2
- Recommendation (clear recommendation): 3

Again, Background (examination) is 2, so even if the session is considered the same, they don't meet both criteria.

Therefore, only Respondent 12 in the exact session ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" has Background (examination) 3 and Recommendation (clear recommendation) 3. Therefore, the answer is 1.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents who scored 3 on 'Background (examination)' also have 'Comments' that contain the word 'unclear'?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking how many respondents scored a 3 on 'Background (examination)' and also have 'Comments' that include the word 'unclear'. 

First, I need to go through each respondent in the data and check two things: their score for 'Background (examination)' and whether their 'Comments' field contains 'unclear'. 

Starting with Respondent 20: Their Background (examination) is -1, which is not 3, so I can skip them. 

Respondent 23: Background (examination) is 2. Not 3. Next.

Respondent 21: Background (examination) is 1. Not 3. Skip.

Respondent 18: Background (examination) is 2. Still not 3.

Respondent 1: Score is 2. Not relevant.

Respondent 9: Score is 2. Moving on.

Respondent 19: Here, Background (examination) is 3. Now check the Comments. The comments mention ""Clarity is a bit low over whole case scenario"". The word 'unclear' isn't there, but 'clarity is a bit low' might be similar. Wait, the exact word 'unclear' is required. Hmm, the comment says ""Clarity is a bit low"", which doesn't have 'unclear', so this might not count. 

Respondent 6: Score is 3. Comments are empty. So no 'unclear' here.

Respondent 5: Background (examination) is 3. Comments say ""Good clear and precise clinical handover Good"". No 'unclear' here.

Respondent 12: Score is 3. Comments are ""Good"". Doesn't include 'unclear'.

Respondent 13: Score is 1. Not applicable.

Respondent 15: Score is 3. Comments: ""Detailed Response - clear communication"". No 'unclear' here.

Wait, did I miss any? Let me check again. 

Looking at Respondent 9 again: Their comment is ""Overall a bit unclear communication reflected"". Oh, here's one! Wait, but Respondent 9's Background (examination) is 2, not 3. So even though their comment has 'unclear', their score isn't 3. So that doesn't count.

Respondent 19's comment: ""Clarity is a bit low over whole case scenario"". The word 'unclear' isn't present. So even though it's about clarity, the exact word isn't there. So that doesn't count.

Wait, are there any other respondents with a score of 3 in Background (examination)? Let's list them:

- Respondent 19: 3
- Respondent 6: 3
- Respondent 5: 3
- Respondent 12: 3
- Respondent 15: 3

Now check each of their comments:

- Respondent 19: ""Wrong CPR position Clarity is a bit low over whole case scenario Satisfactory"" → 'Clarity' but not 'unclear'.
- Respondent 6: No comments.
- Respondent 5: ""Good clear and precise clinical handover Good"" → 'clear', not 'unclear'.
- Respondent 12: ""Good"" → no.
- Respondent 15: ""Detailed Response - clear communication"" → no.

So none of the respondents with a Background (examination) score of 3 have 'unclear' in their comments. Therefore, the answer should be 0.

Wait, but wait. Let me check again. Did I miss any? Let me go through each one again.

Respondent 19: Comments mention 'clarity is a bit low' but not 'unclear'. So no.

Respondent 6: No comments. 

Respondent 5: 'clear' but not 'unclear'.

Respondent 12: 'Good' → no.

Respondent 15: 'clear communication' → no.

So none of them have 'unclear' in their comments. Therefore, the count is 0.

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who participated in a session where the average 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' for that session name is greater than 2.5.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents who participated in a session where the average 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' for that session name is greater than 2.5. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The data provided includes multiple respondents, each with a SessionName and a 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' score. The goal is to group respondents by their SessionName, calculate the average of the global rating scale for each session, and then count how many respondents are in sessions where this average exceeds 2.5.

Let me start by listing all the SessionNames and their corresponding global rating scale values. 

Looking at the responses:

- Respondent 12: SessionName ""II (Anaphylaxis)"", GRS 3
- Respondent 1: ""V (Hypoglycemia)"", GRS 2
- Respondent 6: ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"", GRS 3
- Respondent 5: ""II - Anaphylaxsis"", GRS 3
- Respondent 19: ""I - MI"", GRS 3
- Respondent 13: ""I-VF"", GRS 2
- Respondent 3: ""III-Sepsis"", GRS 3
- Respondent 20: ""IV (VT)"", GRS 3
- Respondent 23: ""II-Anaphylaxsis"", GRS 3
- Respondent 11: ""IV (AF)"", GRS 3

Now, group these by SessionName. Let's note that some SessionNames might be variations but refer to the same session. For example, ""II (Anaphylaxis)"", ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"", ""II - Anaphylaxsis"", and ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" could be considered the same session, but the names are slightly different. However, the problem states to use the exact SessionName as provided. So each unique SessionName string is treated as a separate session.

Wait, but in the example given in the problem, the answer was 2 for the session ""I - MI"". Let me check the example again. In the example, the user asked how many respondents were in the ""I - MI"" session, and the answer was 2. Looking at the example data, there was one respondent (Respondent 19) with SessionName ""I - MI"". But the answer was 2. Hmm, maybe the example had more data that's not shown here. But in the current dataset provided, the actual data for the task is under the <questionnaire> tag. Let me focus on that.

Wait, the user provided an example where the answer was 2, but in the current task, the data is different. So I need to process the current data given in the questionnaire section.

Looking at the current data:

List of SessionNames and their GRS:

1. Respondent 12: II (Anaphylaxis) - GRS 3
2. Respondent 1: V (Hypoglycemia) - GRS 2
3. Respondent 6: II (Anaphylactic Shock) - GRS 3
4. Respondent 5: II - Anaphylaxsis - GRS 3
5. Respondent 19: I - MI - GRS 3
6. Respondent 13: I-VF - GRS 2
7. Respondent 3: III-Sepsis - GRS 3
8. Respondent 20: IV (VT) - GRS 3
9. Respondent 23: II-Anaphylaxsis - GRS 3
10. Respondent 11: IV (AF) - GRS 3

Now, group by SessionName:

- II (Anaphylaxis): 1 respondent, GRS 3 → average 3
- V (Hypoglycemia): 1 respondent, GRS 2 → average 2
- II (Anaphylactic Shock): 1 respondent, GRS 3 → average 3
- II - Anaphylaxsis: 1 respondent, GRS 3 → average 3
- I - MI: 1 respondent, GRS 3 → average 3
- I-VF: 1 respondent, GRS 2 → average 2
- III-Sepsis: 1 respondent, GRS 3 → average 3
- IV (VT): 1 respondent, GRS 3 → average 3
- II-Anaphylaxsis: 1 respondent, GRS 3 → average 3
- IV (AF): 1 respondent, GRS 3 → average 3

Wait, but each session here has only one respondent. So each session's average is the same as the individual's GRS. Therefore, sessions with GRS >2.5 (i.e., 3) would be all sessions where the GRS is 3. 

But the task is to count the number of respondents in sessions where the average GRS is >2.5. Since each session here has only one respondent, the average is their individual score. So any respondent with GRS 3 would be in a session with average 3, which is >2.5. Those with GRS 2 would be in sessions with average 2, which is ≤2.5.

Looking at the respondents:

- Respondents with GRS 3: 12, 5, 19, 3, 20, 23, 11, 6 (Wait, let's check each):

Wait, let's list each respondent's GRS:

- Respondent 12: 3
- Respondent 1: 2
- Respondent 6: 3
- Respondent 5: 3
- Respondent 19: 3
- Respondent 13: 2
- Respondent 3: 3
- Respondent 20: 3
- Respondent 23: 3
- Respondent 11: 3

So total of 8 respondents with GRS 3. Each of these is in a session where the average is 3. The other two (Respondent 1 and 13) have GRS 2, so their sessions' averages are 2. 

Therefore, the count of respondents in sessions with average GRS >2.5 is 8. 

But wait, the example answer was 2 for a similar question. However, in the example, the answer was for a specific session (I - MI) which had one respondent. But the current task is different. The current task is to count all respondents in any session where the session's average GRS is >2.5. 

So according to the data provided, the answer should be 8. But let me double-check each respondent's GRS and their session's average.

Each session has only one respondent, so the average is their individual score. Therefore, all respondents with GRS 3 (which is 8 respondents) are in sessions where the average is 3, which is greater than 2.5. The two respondents with GRS 2 are in sessions with average 2, which is not greater than 2.5. 

Therefore, the answer should be 8.

First, I need to understand the data structure. The data provided includes multiple respondents, each with a 'SessionName' and a 'Situation' score. The 'Situation' is a rubric-based score from 0 to 3. 

The key steps here are:
1. Group all respondents by their 'SessionName'.
2. For each session group, calculate the average 'Situation' score.
3. Identify which sessions have an average 'Situation' score greater than 2.0.
4. Count all respondents that belong to those sessions.

Let me start by listing all the respondents and their SessionNames along with their Situation scores.

Looking at the data:

- Respondent 3: SessionName III-Sepsis, Situation 2
- Respondent 17: SessionName V (Hypoglycemia), Situation 3
- Respondent 7: SessionName III-Sepsis, Situation 3
- Respondent 13: SessionName I-VF, Situation 3
- Respondent 14: SessionName IV-Hypoglycemia, Situation 3
- Respondent 15: SessionName III - Sepsis, Situation 3
- Respondent 11: SessionName IV (AF), Situation 3
- Respondent 6: SessionName II (Anaphylactic Shock), Situation 2

Wait, I need to note the exact SessionNames as they might have variations. For example, ""III-Sepsis"" vs ""III - Sepsis"" (with spaces). Are these considered the same session? The problem states to group by SessionName, so I need to check if these are different or the same. Let's look at the SessionNames:

- III-Sepsis (Respondent 3 and 7)
- III - Sepsis (Respondent 15) – note the space around the hyphen. Are these considered the same session? The problem might treat them as different if the names are not exactly the same. But maybe it's a typo. Hmm. The example given in the original data had ""I - MI"" as the session name. The task is about sessions named 'I - MI', but in the data provided, there's no such session. Wait, the example's answer was 2, but in the current data, the task is different. Wait, the user provided an example where the answer was 2 for 'I - MI' sessions, but in the current task, the question is different. Let me focus on the current task.

Wait, the current task is not about a specific session name but about any session where the average Situation score is >2.0. So regardless of the session name, group by each unique session name, compute the average, then count all respondents in sessions where the average is >2.0.

So first, list all unique SessionNames:

Looking at the responses:

1. III-Sepsis (Respondent 3, 7)
2. V (Hypoglycemia) (Respondent 17)
3. I-VF (Respondent 13)
4. IV-Hypoglycemia (Respondent 14)
5. III - Sepsis (Respondent 15) – note the hyphen with spaces
6. IV (AF) (Respondent 11)
7. II (Anaphylactic Shock) (Respondent 6)

Wait, but ""III-Sepsis"" and ""III - Sepsis"" – are these considered the same session? The names are slightly different. For example, one is ""III-Sepsis"" (hyphen without spaces) and the other is ""III - Sepsis"" (hyphen with spaces). Depending on how the data is structured, these might be considered different sessions. However, in real data analysis, such inconsistencies can happen. But according to the data provided, they are written differently. So, unless there's a note that they should be considered the same, we have to treat them as separate.

But let's check the data again. For example, Respondent 3's SessionName is ""III-Sepsis"", Respondent 7's is ""III-Sepsis"", and Respondent 15's is ""III - Sepsis"". So two different session names. Therefore, they are separate groups.

Now, for each session, calculate the average Situation score.

Let's process each session:

1. III-Sepsis:
   - Respondents: 3 (Situation 2), 7 (Situation 3)
   - Total Situation scores: 2 + 3 = 5
   - Number of respondents: 2
   - Average: 5/2 = 2.5

2. V (Hypoglycemia):
   - Respondent 17: Situation 3
   - Average: 3/1 = 3.0

3. I-VF:
   - Respondent 13: Situation 3
   - Average: 3/1 = 3.0

4. IV-Hypoglycemia:
   - Respondent 14: Situation 3
   - Average: 3/1 = 3.0

5. III - Sepsis:
   - Respondent 15: Situation 3
   - Average: 3/1 = 3.0

6. IV (AF):
   - Respondent 11: Situation 3
   - Average: 3/1 = 3.0

7. II (Anaphylactic Shock):
   - Respondent 6: Situation 2
   - Average: 2/1 = 2.0

Now, the average Situation scores per session:

- III-Sepsis: 2.5 (>2.0 → include)
- V (Hypoglycemia): 3.0 (>2.0 → include)
- I-VF: 3.0 (include)
- IV-Hypoglycemia: 3.0 (include)
- III - Sepsis: 3.0 (include)
- IV (AF): 3.0 (include)
- II (Anaphylactic Shock): 2.0 (not >2.0 → exclude)

So the sessions with average >2.0 are all except II (Anaphylactic Shock). Now, count the number of respondents in these sessions.

Let's list the sessions and their respondents:

1. III-Sepsis: Respondents 3,7 → 2
2. V (Hypoglycemia): 17 → 1
3. I-VF: 13 →1
4. IV-Hypoglycemia:14 →1
5. III - Sepsis:15 →1
6. IV (AF):11 →1

Total respondents: 2+1+1+1+1+1=7

Wait, but let's check each session:

Wait, III-Sepsis (2 respondents), V (Hypoglycemia) (1), I-VF (1), IV-Hypoglycemia (1), III - Sepsis (1), IV (AF) (1). That's 2+1+1+1+1+1=7 respondents. But wait, the session ""III - Sepsis"" (with spaces) has only Respondent 15. So total respondents in sessions with average >2.0 are 2 (III-Sepsis) +1 (V) +1 (I-VF) +1 (IV-Hypoglycemia) +1 (III - Sepsis) +1 (IV (AF)) = 7.

But wait, the session ""III - Sepsis"" (with spaces) is separate from ""III-Sepsis"" (without spaces). So each is a separate session. So their averages are 3.0 and 2.5 respectively. Both are above 2.0. So all their respondents are included.

So total respondents in qualifying sessions: 2 (III-Sepsis) +1 (V) +1 (I-VF) +1 (IV-Hypoglycemia) +1 (III - Sepsis) +1 (IV (AF)) = 7.

But wait, let me recount:

- III-Sepsis (no space): 3 and 7 → 2
- V (Hypoglycemia):17 →1
- I-VF:13 →1
- IV-Hypoglycemia:14 →1
- III - Sepsis (with space):15 →1
- IV (AF):11 →1
Total: 2+1+1+1+1+1=7.

But the answer in the example was 2, but that was for a different question. Here, according to this calculation, the answer is 7. However, let me check if I made a mistake in the session names.

Wait, the SessionName for Respondent 15 is ""III - Sepsis"" (with spaces around the hyphen), which is different from ""III-Sepsis"" (no spaces). Therefore, they are separate sessions. Each has their own average. Both have averages above 2.0. So their respondents are included.

But let me check the data again to confirm:

Respondent 3: III-Sepsis

Respondent 7: III-Sepsis

Respondent 15: III - Sepsis

So three different sessions? Wait, no. Wait, III-Sepsis (Respondent 3 and 7) is one session with two respondents. III - Sepsis (Respondent 15) is another session with one respondent. So each is a separate session. Therefore, their averages are calculated separately. Both have averages above 2.0. So all three respondents (3,7,15) are included.

Wait, but in the calculation above, III-Sepsis (no space) has two respondents (3 and7), average 2.5. III - Sepsis (with space) has one respondent (15), average 3.0. So both sessions are included. Therefore, total respondents in these two sessions: 2 +1=3. Then the other sessions (V, I-VF, IV-Hypoglycemia, IV (AF)) each have one respondent, so 1+1+1+1=4. Total 3+4=7.

But according to the data, the answer would be 7. However, let me check if I made a mistake in the calculation. For example, the session IV-Hypoglycemia (Respondent 14) has a Situation score of 3. So average is 3.0. IV (AF) (Respondent 11) has 3.0. I-VF (Respondent 13) has 3.0. V (Hypoglycemia) (17) has 3.0. III-Sepsis (3 and7) average 2.5. III - Sepsis (15) average 3.0. All of these sessions have averages above 2.0. The only session not included is II (Anaphylactic Shock) with average 2.0, which is not greater than 2.0.

Therefore, the total respondents in qualifying sessions are 2 (III-Sepsis) +1 (V) +1 (I-VF) +1 (IV-Hypoglycemia) +1 (III - Sepsis) +1 (IV (AF)) = 7.

But wait, the example given in the problem had an answer of 2, but that was for a different session name. However, in the current data, according to the analysis, the answer should be 7. But let me check again to make sure I didn't miss any sessions or miscalculate averages.

Wait, let's list all sessions and their respondents:

1. III-Sepsis (no space): Respondents 3 (Sit=2), 7 (Sit=3) → average (2+3)/2=2.5
2. V (Hypoglycemia): 17 (3) → 3.0
3. I-VF:13 (3) →3.0
4. IV-Hypoglycemia:14 (3) →3.0
5. III - Sepsis (with space):15 (3) →3.0
6. IV (AF):11 (3) →3.0
7. II (Anaphylactic Shock):6 (2) →2.0

All sessions except the last one have averages >2.0. So the count is the sum of respondents in the first six sessions: 2+1+1+1+1+1=7.

Therefore, the answer should be 7. But wait, the example answer was 2, but that was for a different question. However, in the current task, the answer is 7. But let me check again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the SessionName for Respondent 15 is a typo and should be considered the same as III-Sepsis. If that's the case, then the session III-Sepsis would have three respondents: 3,7,15. Then the average would be (2+3+3)/3=8/3≈2.666..., which is still above 2.0. Then the total respondents would be 3 (III-Sepsis) +1 (V) +1 (I-VF) +1 (IV-Hypoglycemia) +1 (IV (AF)) = 7. So the answer remains 7. But the problem is whether ""III - Sepsis"" and ""III-Sepsis"" are considered the same. If they are different, then the answer is 7. If they are the same, then the answer is still 7. Because even if merged, the average is still above 2.0. So either way, the answer is 7.

But according to the data as given, the SessionNames are written differently. Unless there's a note that they should be normalized, we have to treat them as separate. Therefore, the answer is 7.

But wait, looking back at the example provided in the problem, the answer was 2 for the 'I - MI' session. In that example, the data included sessions like 'I-VF', 'III-Sepsis', etc. The answer was 2, which probably referred to two respondents in a session named 'I - MI', but in the current data, there's no such session. So the example is just an example. The current task is different.

Therefore, based on the current data and the analysis, the correct answer is 7.

- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who participated in a session where the average 'Background (examination)' for that session name is greater than 2.0.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the number of respondents who participated in a session where the average 'Background (examination)' score for that session name is greater than 2.0. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The data provided includes multiple respondents, each with a 'SessionName' and a 'Background (examination)' score. The 'Background (examination)' is a rubric-based score ranging from 0 to 3. 

The goal is to group respondents by their 'SessionName', calculate the average 'Background (examination)' score for each session, and then count how many respondents are in sessions where this average exceeds 2.0.

Let me start by listing all the respondents and their SessionNames along with their 'Background (examination)' scores:

- Respondent 10: SessionName (MI)-VT, Background (examination) = 2
- Respondent 11: IV (AF), 3
- Respondent 19: I - MI, 3
- Respondent 20: IV (VT), -1
- Respondent 3: III-Sepsis, 3
- Respondent 2: MI, 3
- Respondent 5: II - Anaphylaxsis, 3
- Respondent 6: II (Anaphylactic Shock), 3
- Respondent 13: I-VF, 1
- Respondent 23: II-Anaphylaxsis, 2

Now, I need to group these by SessionName. Let's list each unique SessionName and collect all their 'Background (examination)' scores:

1. (MI)-VT: [2]
2. IV (AF): [3]
3. I - MI: [3]
4. IV (VT): [-1]
5. III-Sepsis: [3]
6. MI: [3]
7. II - Anaphylaxsis: [3]
8. II (Anaphylactic Shock): [3]
9. I-VF: [1]
10. II-Anaphylaxsis: [2]

Wait, but some SessionNames might be the same but written differently. For example, ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" and ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" could be considered the same session, but the names are slightly different. However, looking at the data, ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" (Respondent 5) and ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" (Respondent 23) might be the same session but with a hyphen vs. space. Similarly, ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)"" (Respondent 6) is a different name. The problem states to group by the exact 'SessionName' as provided. So each variation is treated as a separate session unless the names are identical.

So proceeding with exact SessionName matches:

Let's process each session:

1. (MI)-VT: Only Respondent 10. Average = 2.0. Since 2.0 is not greater than 2.0, this session doesn't qualify.
2. IV (AF): Respondent 11. Average = 3.0. This is greater than 2.0. So all respondents in this session (1 person) count.
3. I - MI: Respondent 19. Average = 3.0. Qualifies. 1 person.
4. IV (VT): Respondent 20. Score is -1. Average = -1. Doesn't qualify.
5. III-Sepsis: Respondent 3. Average = 3.0. Qualifies. 1 person.
6. MI: Respondent 2. Average = 3.0. Qualifies. 1 person.
7. II - Anaphylaxsis: Respondent 5. Average = 3.0. Qualifies. 1 person.
8. II (Anaphylactic Shock): Respondent 6. Average = 3.0. Qualifies. 1 person.
9. I-VF: Respondent 13. Average = 1.0. Doesn't qualify.
10. II-Anaphylaxsis: Respondent 23. Average = 2.0. Doesn't qualify (since 2.0 is not greater than 2.0).

Now, count the number of respondents in sessions where the average is >2.0:

Sessions that qualify: IV (AF), I - MI, III-Sepsis, MI, II - Anaphylaxsis, II (Anaphylactic Shock). Each of these sessions has 1 respondent. So total respondents = 1 +1 +1 +1 +1 +1 = 6.

Wait, but let me double-check each session's average:

- IV (AF): 3.0 >2.0 → yes.
- I - MI: 3.0 → yes.
- III-Sepsis: 3.0 → yes.
- MI: 3.0 → yes.
- II - Anaphylaxsis: 3.0 → yes.
- II (Anaphylactic Shock): 3.0 → yes.

That's 6 sessions, each with 1 respondent. So total respondents is 6.

But wait, let me check if any session has more than one respondent. For example, is there any other respondent with the same SessionName as any of these?

Looking back:

- IV (AF): only Respondent 11.
- I - MI: only Respondent 19.
- III-Sepsis: only Respondent 3.
- MI: only Respondent 2.
- II - Anaphylaxsis: only Respondent 5.
- II (Anaphylactic Shock): only Respondent 6.

So each qualifying session has exactly one respondent. Therefore, the total number of respondents is 6.

Count the respondents who participated in a session where the average 'Assessment' for that session name is greater than 2.5.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the number of respondents who participated in a session where the average 'Assessment' score for that session name is greater than 2.5. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The data provided includes multiple respondents, each with a 'SessionName' and an 'Assessment' score. The 'Assessment' rubric goes from 0 to 3. The goal is to group respondents by their SessionName, calculate the average Assessment score for each session, and then count how many respondents are in sessions where that average is above 2.5.

Let me start by listing all the respondents and their SessionNames along with their Assessment scores:

- Respondent 22: SessionName IV (VT), Assessment 2
- Respondent 3: SessionName III-Sepsis, Assessment 3
- Respondent 9: SessionName II (Anaphylaxsis), Assessment 2
- Respondent 15: SessionName III - Sepsis, Assessment 2
- Respondent 14: SessionName IV-Hypoglycemia, Assessment 3
- Respondent 16: SessionName I - MI, Assessment 3
- Respondent 20: SessionName IV (VT), Assessment 3
- Respondent 19: SessionName I - MI, Assessment 2

Now, I need to group these by SessionName. Let's note that some SessionNames might be the same but written slightly differently. For example, ""III-Sepsis"" and ""III - Sepsis"" could be the same session. But according to the data, they are written as different SessionNames. So I should treat them as separate unless they are exactly the same. Wait, looking at the data:

- Respondent 3: III-Sepsis
- Respondent 15: III - Sepsis (with a space and hyphen)

These might be the same session but formatted differently. However, in data analysis, unless explicitly stated that they are the same, we should consider them as different. So, I'll treat them as separate sessions. Similarly, ""IV (VT)"" and ""IV-Hypoglycemia"" are different.

So the SessionNames are:

1. IV (VT)
2. III-Sepsis
3. II (Anaphylaxsis)
4. III - Sepsis
5. IV-Hypoglycemia
6. I - MI
7. IV (VT) again (Respondent 20)
8. I - MI again (Respondent 19)

Wait, actually, let's list all unique SessionNames:

Looking at all the SessionNames:

- IV (VT) appears for Respondent 22 and 20.
- III-Sepsis: Respondent 3
- II (Anaphylaxsis): Respondent 9
- III - Sepsis: Respondent 15
- IV-Hypoglycemia: Respondent 14
- I - MI: Respondent 16 and 19

So the unique SessionNames are:

1. IV (VT) – 2 respondents
2. III-Sepsis – 1 respondent
3. II (Anaphylaxsis) – 1
4. III - Sepsis – 1
5. IV-Hypoglycemia – 1
6. I - MI – 2 respondents

Now, for each of these sessions, calculate the average Assessment score.

Let's go through each:

1. IV (VT): Respondents 22 (Assessment 2) and 20 (Assessment 3). Average = (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5. The problem states ""greater than 2.5"", so this is exactly 2.5, which doesn't meet the condition.

2. III-Sepsis: Respondent 3 has Assessment 3. Average is 3.0. This is above 2.5.

3. II (Anaphylaxsis): Respondent 9 has Assessment 2. Average is 2.0. Below 2.5.

4. III - Sepsis: Respondent 15 has Assessment 2. Average 2.0. Below.

5. IV-Hypoglycemia: Respondent 14 has Assessment 3. Average 3.0. Above 2.5.

6. I - MI: Respondents 16 (Assessment 3) and 19 (Assessment 2). Average = (3 + 2)/2 = 2.5. Again, exactly 2.5, so doesn't meet the condition.

Wait, but the problem says ""average 'Assessment' for that session name is greater than 2.5"". So sessions with average >2.5 are:

- III-Sepsis (3.0)
- IV-Hypoglycemia (3.0)

Wait, but wait, let me double-check:

For III-Sepsis: only Respondent 3, Assessment 3. Average is 3.0. So yes, >2.5.

IV-Hypoglycemia: only Respondent 14, Assessment 3. Average 3.0. Also >2.5.

The other sessions:

IV (VT) average 2.5, which is not greater than 2.5.

I - MI average 2.5, same.

So the sessions that meet the condition are III-Sepsis, IV-Hypoglycemia, and any others?

Wait, let's check again:

Wait, III-Sepsis and III - Sepsis are different SessionNames? Because one is ""III-Sepsis"" and the other is ""III - Sepsis"" (with a space). So they are considered different sessions. So each has only one respondent. So III-Sepsis (Respondent 3) has average 3.0, and III - Sepsis (Respondent 15) has average 2.0. So only III-Sepsis (average 3.0) and IV-Hypoglycemia (average 3.0) meet the condition.

Wait, but Respondent 3's SessionName is ""III-Sepsis"" and Respondent 15's is ""III - Sepsis"". So they are different sessions. Therefore, each has only one respondent. So their averages are 3 and 2 respectively.

So the sessions with average >2.5 are:

- III-Sepsis (average 3.0)
- IV-Hypoglycemia (average 3.0)

Now, how many respondents are in these sessions?

III-Sepsis: 1 respondent (Respondent 3)
IV-Hypoglycemia: 1 respondent (Respondent 14)

So total respondents in sessions with average >2.5 is 1 + 1 = 2.

Wait, but wait, let me check again. Are there any other sessions?

Looking back:

IV (VT): 2 respondents, average 2.5 – no
III-Sepsis: 1, average 3.0 – yes
II (Anaphylaxsis): 1, average 2.0 – no
III - Sepsis: 1, average 2.0 – no
IV-Hypoglycemia: 1, average 3.0 – yes
I - MI: 2, average 2.5 – no

So only the two sessions (III-Sepsis and IV-Hypoglycemia) have averages above 2.5, each with 1 respondent. So total respondents would be 2.

But wait, the example given in the problem had the answer 2 for a similar question. Let me check if I made a mistake here.

Wait, the example's answer was 2 for the question ""How many respondents participated in a 'I - MI' session?"" which had two respondents (16 and 19). So in that case, the answer was 2. But in this current task, the question is different.

Wait, the current task is to count the respondents in sessions where the session's average Assessment is >2.5. So according to the analysis, that's two respondents: 3 and 14. So the answer would be 2.

But wait, let me check again. Let me list all sessions and their averages:

1. IV (VT): 2 respondents (22 and 20) with Assessments 2 and 3. Average: 2.5. Not >2.5.
2. III-Sepsis: 1 respondent (3) with Assessment 3. Average 3.0. Yes.
3. II (Anaphylaxsis): 1 respondent (9) with Assessment 2. Average 2.0. No.
4. III - Sepsis: 1 respondent (15) with Assessment 2. Average 2.0. No.
5. IV-Hypoglycemia: 1 respondent (14) with Assessment 3. Average 3.0. Yes.
6. I - MI: 2 respondents (16 and 19) with Assessments 3 and 2. Average 2.5. No.

So the sessions that meet the condition are III-Sepsis and IV-Hypoglycemia. Each has 1 respondent. So total respondents is 2.

But wait, the answer in the example was 2 for a different question. But here, according to this analysis, the answer should be 2. However, I need to make sure I didn't miss any other sessions.

Wait, another check: Respondent 3 is in III-Sepsis, and Respondent 14 is in IV-Hypoglycemia. So two respondents. Therefore, the answer is 2.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents whose comments contain 'Good' also have a total score across all rubric items that is below the average total score for all sessions?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking: How many respondents whose comments contain 'Good' also have a total score across all rubric items that is below the average total score for all sessions?

First, I need to break down the requirements. 

1. Identify all respondents whose comments include the word 'Good'.
2. Calculate the total score for each of those respondents.
3. Compute the average total score across all sessions.
4. Compare the total scores of the identified respondents against this average.
5. Count how many of them have a total score below the average.

Let's start by going through each respondent's data.

Looking at the responses:

- **Respondent 7**: Comments don't mention 'Good'.
- **Respondent 17**: Comments say ""Concise - clear Satisfactory"" – no 'Good'.
- **Respondent 4**: Comments mention ""satisfactory"" but not 'Good'.
- **Respondent 12**: Comments: ""Good"". This one has 'Good'.
- **Respondent 14**: Comments don't have 'Good'.
- **Respondent 21**: Comments: ""Diagnostic clarity is present Good and early assessment..."" – contains 'Good'.
- **Respondent 10**: No 'Good' in comments.
- **Respondent 16**: Comments: ""Satisfactory"" – no 'Good'.
- **Respondent 9**: No 'Good'.
- **Respondent 11**: Comments: ""Clear communication and handover"" – no 'Good'.

So, respondents 12 and 21 have comments with 'Good'.

Next, calculate their total scores.

For each respondent, sum all rubric items (Identification, Situation, Background (history), Background (examination), Assessment, Recommendation (clear recommendation), Recommendation (global rating scale)).

Let's compute each:

**Respondent 12**:
- Identification: 3
- Situation: 3
- Background (history): 3
- Background (examination): 3
- Assessment: 2
- Recommendation (clear recommendation): 3
- Recommendation (global rating scale): 3
Total = 3+3+3+3+2+3+3 = 20

**Respondent 21**:
- Identification: 3
- Situation: 2
- Background (history): 3
- Background (examination): 1
- Assessment: 2
- Recommendation (clear recommendation): 3
- Recommendation (global rating scale): 3
Total = 3+2+3+1+2+3+3 = 17

Now, calculate the average total score for all sessions. Let's compute each respondent's total first:

All respondents:

1. **Respondent 7**:
3 (Id) +3 (Sit) +2 (BgH) +3 (BgE) +2 (Assess) +2 (Rec) +2 (GRS) = 3+3+2+3+2+2+2=17

2. **Respondent 17**:
3+3+3+3+3+3+2=20

3. **Respondent 4**:
3+3+3+2+2+2+2=17

4. **Respondent 12**: 20 (as above)

5. **Respondent 14**:
3+3+2+2+3+1+2=16

6. **Respondent 21**:17

7. **Respondent 10**:
2+2+2+2+2+2+2=14

8. **Respondent 16**:
3+3+3+3+3+2+3=20

9. **Respondent 9**:
3+3+2+2+2+3+2=17

10. **Respondent 11**:
3+3+3+3+3+3+3=21

Now, sum all totals and divide by 10:

17 +20 +17 +20 +16 +17 +14 +20 +17 +21 = 

Let's add step by step:

17+20=37; 37+17=54; 54+20=74; 74+16=90; 90+17=107; 107+14=121; 121+20=141; 141+17=158; 158+21=179.

Total sum is 179. Average = 179 /10 = 17.9.

Now, check the two respondents with 'Good' in comments:

- Respondent 12: total 20. 20 is above 17.9, so doesn't count.
- Respondent 21: total 17. 17 is below 17.9.

So only Respondent 21 has a total below the average. Therefore, the answer is 1.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who participated in a session where the average 'Situation' for that session name is greater than 2.0.
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to count the respondents who participated in a session where the average 'Situation' score for that session name is greater than 2.0. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The data has multiple respondents, each with a SessionName and a Situation score. The Situation score is a rubric-based value from 0 to 3. The goal is to group respondents by their SessionName, calculate the average Situation score for each session, and then count how many respondents are in sessions where that average is above 2.0.

Let me start by listing all the respondents and their SessionName and Situation scores. 

Looking at the responses:

- Respondent 2: SessionName ""MI"", Situation 3
- Respondent 8: SessionName ""III (Sepsis)"", Situation 3
- Respondent 13: SessionName ""I-VF"", Situation 3
- Respondent 20: SessionName ""IV (VT)"", Situation 3
- Respondent 23: SessionName ""II-Anaphylaxsis"", Situation 3
- Respondent 1: SessionName ""V (Hypoglycemia)"", Situation 2
- Respondent 7: SessionName ""III-Sepsis"", Situation 3
- Respondent 10: SessionName ""(MI)-VT"", Situation 2
- Respondent 4: SessionName ""III (Sepsis)"", Situation 3
- Respondent 21: SessionName ""I (Myocardial infarction)"", Situation 2

Wait, I need to make sure I group the sessions correctly. The SessionName might have variations. For example, ""III (Sepsis)"" and ""III-Sepsis"" could be the same session. Similarly, ""MI"" and ""I (Myocardial infarction)"" might be related since MI stands for Myocardial Infarction. Let me check each SessionName:

- ""MI"": Myocardial Infarction
- ""III (Sepsis)"": Sepsis
- ""I-VF"": Ventricular Fibrillation (VF)
- ""IV (VT)"": Ventricular Tachycardia (VT)
- ""II-Anaphylaxsis"": Anaphylaxis
- ""V (Hypoglycemia)"": Hypoglycemia
- ""III-Sepsis"": Sepsis (same as ""III (Sepsis)"")
- ""(MI)-VT"": MI combined with VT?
- ""III (Sepsis)"": Sepsis again
- ""I (Myocardial infarction)"": Myocardial Infarction (same as ""MI"")

So, grouping similar SessionNames:

1. MI-related sessions:
   - ""MI"" (Respondent 2)
   - ""I (Myocardial infarction)"" (Respondent 21)
   - ""(MI)-VT"" (Respondent 10) – this might be a combination, but the SessionName is written as ""(MI)-VT"", which could be a different session. Need to check if it's considered the same as ""MI"" or a separate session.

2. Sepsis-related sessions:
   - ""III (Sepsis)"" (Respondents 8 and 4)
   - ""III-Sepsis"" (Respondent 7)

3. Others:
   - ""I-VF"" (Respondent 13)
   - ""IV (VT)"" (Respondent 20)
   - ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" (Respondent 23)
   - ""V (Hypoglycemia)"" (Respondent 1)

Now, the key is to determine which SessionNames are considered the same. For example, ""III (Sepsis)"" and ""III-Sepsis"" likely refer to the same session type (Sepsis) under different naming conventions. Similarly, ""I (Myocardial infarction)"" is the same as ""MI"". However, ""(MI)-VT"" might be a different session that combines MI and VT, so it's a separate session name. 

Let me list each unique SessionName and their corresponding Situation scores:

1. MI:
   - Respondent 2: Situation 3
   - Respondent 21: SessionName ""I (Myocardial infarction)"", Situation 2
   - Wait, no. Respondent 21's SessionName is ""I (Myocardial infarction)"", which is MI. So, if ""I (Myocardial infarction)"" is considered the same as ""MI"", then these would be grouped together. But the SessionName is written differently. However, the problem states to group by the exact SessionName. Wait, the task says ""session name"" as per the data. So, if the SessionName is written differently, even if they refer to the same condition, they are considered different sessions. For example, ""III (Sepsis)"" and ""III-Sepsis"" might be considered different unless the data shows they are the same. But looking at the data, Respondent 8 has ""III (Sepsis)"", Respondent 4 has ""III (Sepsis)"", and Respondent 7 has ""III-Sepsis"". Are these considered the same session? The problem doesn't specify, so we have to treat them as separate unless the names are identical. So, ""III (Sepsis)"" and ""III-Sepsis"" are different SessionNames. Similarly, ""MI"" and ""I (Myocardial infarction)"" are different SessionNames. 

Wait, but in the example given in the problem, the answer was 2 for the 'I - MI' session. Looking back at the example, the correct answer was 2 respondents in the 'I - MI' session, which included Respondent 2 (SessionName: MI) and Respondent 21 (SessionName: I (Myocardial infarction)). But in the example, the answer was 2, which suggests that the SessionName ""MI"" and ""I (Myocardial infarction)"" are considered the same. However, in the current task, the user might be following the same logic. Wait, but the example's answer was 2, which included Respondent 2 (MI) and Respondent 10 (SessionName: (MI)-VT). Wait, no, in the example, the correct answer was 2, but looking at the example data, the respondents with SessionName containing ""MI"" were Respondent 2 (MI) and Respondent 10 ((MI)-VT). But the answer was 2, which might mean that the user considered ""MI"" and ""(MI)-VT"" as part of the same session. However, in the current task, the instructions might differ. 

But in this current task, the user hasn't specified any grouping beyond the exact SessionName. So, unless the SessionName is exactly the same, they are considered different sessions. Therefore, we need to group by the exact SessionName as written in the data. 

So, let's list all unique SessionNames and their Situation scores:

1. MI: Respondent 2 (Situation 3)
2. III (Sepsis): Respondents 8 and 4 (both Situation 3)
3. I-VF: Respondent 13 (Situation 3)
4. IV (VT): Respondent 20 (Situation 3)
5. II-Anaphylaxsis: Respondent 23 (Situation 3)
6. V (Hypoglycemia): Respondent 1 (Situation 2)
7. III-Sepsis: Respondent 7 (Situation 3)
8. (MI)-VT: Respondent 10 (Situation 2)
9. I (Myocardial infarction): Respondent 21 (Situation 2)

Now, for each SessionName, calculate the average Situation score:

1. MI: Only Respondent 2. Average = 3.0
2. III (Sepsis): Two respondents (8 and 4), both with Situation 3. Average = (3 + 3)/2 = 3.0
3. I-VF: 1 respondent, Situation 3. Average = 3.0
4. IV (VT): 1 respondent, Situation 3. Average = 3.0
5. II-Anaphylaxsis: 1 respondent, Situation 3. Average = 3.0
6. V (Hypoglycemia): 1 respondent, Situation 2. Average = 2.0
7. III-Sepsis: 1 respondent, Situation 3. Average = 3.0
8. (MI)-VT: 1 respondent, Situation 2. Average = 2.0
9. I (Myocardial infarction): 1 respondent, Situation 2. Average = 2.0

Now, the task is to find sessions where the average Situation score is greater than 2.0. So, sessions with average >2.0 are:

- MI (3.0)
- III (Sepsis) (3.0)
- I-VF (3.0)
- IV (VT) (3.0)
- II-Anaphylaxsis (3.0)
- III-Sepsis (3.0)

Sessions with average <=2.0 are:

- V (Hypoglycemia) (2.0)
- (MI)-VT (2.0)
- I (Myocardial infarction) (2.0)

Now, count the number of respondents in the sessions where the average is >2.0:

- MI: 1 respondent (Respondent 2)
- III (Sepsis): 2 respondents (8 and 4)
- I-VF: 1 (13)
- IV (VT): 1 (20)
- II-Anaphylaxsis: 1 (23)
- III-Sepsis: 1 (7)

Total respondents = 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7

Wait, but let me check again:

MI: 1
III (Sepsis): 2
I-VF:1
IV (VT):1
II-Anaphylaxsis:1
III-Sepsis:1

Adding these: 1+2=3, +1=4, +1=5, +1=6, +1=7. So total 7 respondents.

But wait, in the example provided earlier, the answer was 2 for a similar question. But in this case, the answer seems to be 7. However, I need to make sure I didn't make a mistake in grouping.

Wait, let me recheck each session's average:

- III (Sepsis): two respondents, both Situation 3. Average 3.0. Correct.
- III-Sepsis: one respondent, Situation 3. Average 3.0. Correct.
- MI: one respondent, Situation 3. Average 3.0. Correct.
- I (Myocardial infarction): one respondent, Situation 2. Average 2.0. Correct.
- (MI)-VT: one respondent, Situation 2. Average 2.0. Correct.

So all the sessions with average >2.0 are as listed, and the total respondents in those sessions are 7. Therefore, the answer should be 7.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents have a 'Identification' score that is higher than the average 'Identification' for all sessions on the same date?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find out how many respondents have an 'Identification' score higher than the average 'Identification' score for all sessions on the same date. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The data provided includes multiple respondents, each with a Date, SessionName, and various scores including Identification. The Identification score is a rubric-based value from 0 to 3. 

The key steps here are:
1. Group the respondents by their Date.
2. For each group (date), calculate the average Identification score.
3. Compare each respondent's Identification score to the average of their respective date group.
4. Count how many respondents have a score higher than their group's average.

Let me start by listing all the respondents along with their Date and Identification scores:

- Respondent 9: 2025-05-04, Identification 3
- Respondent 10: 2025-03-14, Identification 2
- Respondent 11: 2025-04-04, Identification 3
- Respondent 4: 2025-05-16, Identification 3
- Respondent 1: 2025-05-02, Identification -1 (Wait, the rubric for Identification is 0-3. But here it's -1. Maybe a typo? But according to the data, it's -1. I need to consider it as is, even though it's outside the rubric. Maybe it's an error, but the data must be taken as given.)
- Respondent 16: 2025-05-02, Identification 3
- Respondent 14: 2025-03-14, Identification 3
- Respondent 6: 2025-04-04, Identification 3
- Respondent 3: 2025-04-04, Identification 0

Now, group them by Date:

2025-03-14:
- Respondent 10: 2
- Respondent 14: 3
Total respondents: 2
Sum: 2 + 3 = 5
Average: 5 / 2 = 2.5

2025-04-04:
- Respondent 11: 3
- Respondent 6: 3
- Respondent 3: 0
Total respondents: 3
Sum: 3 + 3 + 0 = 6
Average: 6 / 3 = 2

2025-05-02:
- Respondent 1: -1
- Respondent 16: 3
Total respondents: 2
Sum: -1 + 3 = 2
Average: 2 / 2 = 1

2025-05-04:
- Respondent 9: 3
Only one respondent, so average is 3.

2025-05-16:
- Respondent 4: 3
Only one respondent, average is 3.

Now, for each respondent, check if their Identification score is higher than the average of their date group.

Let's go through each:

2025-03-14 group (average 2.5):
- Respondent 10: 2. 2 < 2.5 → No
- Respondent 14: 3. 3 > 2.5 → Yes

2025-04-04 group (average 2):
- Respondent 11: 3 > 2 → Yes
- Respondent 6: 3 > 2 → Yes
- Respondent 3: 0 < 2 → No

2025-05-02 group (average 1):
- Respondent 1: -1 < 1 → No
- Respondent 16: 3 > 1 → Yes

2025-05-04 group (average 3):
- Respondent 9: 3 is not higher than 3 → No

2025-05-16 group (average 3):
- Respondent 4: 3 is not higher than 3 → No

Now count the number of ""Yes"" cases:
Respondent 14, 11, 6, 16 → Total of 4 respondents.

Wait, but let me double-check:

From the list:

- Respondent 14: Yes
- Respondent 11: Yes
- Respondent 6: Yes
- Respondent 16: Yes

That's 4. But wait, let me check each again.

2025-03-14: 1 (Respondent 14)
2025-04-04: 2 (Respondents 11 and 6)
2025-05-02: 1 (Respondent 16)
Total: 1+2+1=4.

So the answer should be 4. But wait, let me check the data again to make sure I didn't miss any.

Looking back:

Respondent 14: 3 > 2.5 → Yes
Respondent 11: 3 > 2 → Yes
Respondent 6: 3 > 2 → Yes
Respondent 16: 3 > 1 → Yes

Yes, that's four. So the answer is 4.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents have a 'Background (examination)' score that is higher than the average 'Background (examination)' for all sessions on the same date?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to find out how many respondents have a 'Background (examination)' score higher than the average 'Background (examination)' score for all sessions on the same date. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The data provided includes multiple respondents, each with a Date, SessionName, and various scores, including 'Background (examination)'. 

The plan is:
1. Group the respondents by their Date.
2. For each group (date), calculate the average 'Background (examination)' score.
3. For each respondent, compare their 'Background (examination)' score to the average of their respective date group.
4. Count how many respondents have a score higher than their group's average.

Let's start by listing all the respondents and their dates and Background (examination) scores.

Looking at the data:

Respondent 18: Date 2025-05-04, Score 2
Respondent 8: 2025-05-02, Score 2
Respondent 17: 2025-05-04, Score 3
Respondent 23: 2025-03-14, Score 2
Respondent 12: 2025-05-02, Score 3
Respondent 3: 2025-04-04, Score 3
Respondent 13: 2025-03-14, Score 1
Respondent 2: 2025-04-04, Score 3
Respondent 7: 2025-03-14, Score 3
Respondent 1: 2025-05-02, Score 2
Respondent 22: 2025-05-16, Score 3

Now, group by date:

2025-03-14:
- Respondent 23: 2
- Respondent 13: 1
- Respondent 7: 3
Total scores: 2 + 1 + 3 = 6. Average = 6 / 3 = 2.0

2025-04-04:
- Respondent 3: 3
- Respondent 2: 3
Total scores: 3 + 3 = 6. Average = 6 / 2 = 3.0

2025-05-02:
- Respondent 8: 2
- Respondent 12: 3
- Respondent 1: 2
Total scores: 2 + 3 + 2 = 7. Average = 7 / 3 ≈ 2.333...

2025-05-04:
- Respondent 18: 2
- Respondent 17: 3
Total scores: 2 + 3 = 5. Average = 5 / 2 = 2.5

2025-05-16:
- Respondent 22: 3
Only one respondent. Average = 3.0

Now, for each respondent, check if their score is higher than the average of their date group.

2025-03-14 (Average 2.0):
- Respondent 23: 2 → equal, not higher
- Respondent 13: 1 → lower
- Respondent 7: 3 → higher (3 > 2)
So 1 here.

2025-04-04 (Average 3.0):
- Respondent 3: 3 → equal
- Respondent 2: 3 → equal
No one higher.

2025-05-02 (Average ~2.333):
- Respondent 8: 2 → lower
- Respondent 12: 3 → higher (3 > 2.333)
- Respondent 1: 2 → lower
So 1 here.

2025-05-04 (Average 2.5):
- Respondent 18: 2 → lower
- Respondent 17: 3 → higher (3 > 2.5)
So 1 here.

2025-05-16 (Average 3.0):
- Respondent 22: 3 → equal
No one higher.

Adding up the counts: 1 (2025-03-14) + 1 (2025-05-02) + 1 (2025-05-04) = 3 respondents.

Wait, but let me double-check each calculation.

For 2025-05-02, the average is 7/3 ≈ 2.333. Respondent 12 has a score of 3, which is higher. Correct. Respondent 8 and 1 have 2, which is lower. So that's 1.

2025-05-04: Respondent 17's 3 is higher than 2.5. Correct. So 1.

2025-03-14: Respondent 7's 3 is higher than 2.0. Correct. 1.

Total of 3 respondents. But wait, let me check all the respondents again to make sure I didn't miss any.

Wait, the list of respondents is 18,8,17,23,12,3,13,2,7,1,22. That's 11 respondents. Let me check each one:

Respondent 7: Date 2025-03-14, score 3. Average for that date is 2.0. 3>2 → yes. Counted.

Respondent 12: 2025-05-02, score 3. Average ~2.333. 3>2.333 → yes. Counted.

Respondent 17: 2025-05-04, score 3. Average 2.5. 3>2.5 → yes. Counted.

Others:

Respondent 22: 3 vs 3 → no.

So total 3. Therefore, the answer is 3.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents whose comments contain 'Clear' also have a total score across all rubric items that is below the average total score for all sessions?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking for the number of respondents whose comments include the word 'Clear' and whose total scores across all rubric items are below the average total score for all sessions. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The data provided includes several respondents with various scores on different rubric items. Each respondent has a SessionName, several scores (like Identification, Situation, Background history, etc.), and Comments. 

The first task is to calculate the total score for each respondent. The rubric items are: Identification, Situation, Background (history), Background (examination), Assessment, Recommendation (clear recommendation), and Recommendation (global rating scale). Each of these is scored from 0 to 3. So, for each respondent, I need to sum these seven scores to get their total.

Next, I need to compute the average total score across all sessions. That means adding up all the total scores of all respondents and dividing by the number of respondents. 

Then, I have to identify which respondents have the word 'Clear' in their Comments. For each of those respondents, check if their total score is below the calculated average. Finally, count how many such respondents there are.

Let me start by listing all the respondents and calculating their total scores.

Looking at the data:

Respondent 11:
Scores: 3,3,3,3,3,3,3. Sum is 3*7=21.

Respondent 19:
Scores: 3,3,3,3,2,3,3. Sum is 3+3+3+3+2+3+3=20.

Respondent 14:
Scores: 3,3,2,2,3,1,2. Sum is 3+3+2+2+3+1+2=16.

Respondent 22:
Scores: 3,3,3,3,2,2,3. Sum is 3+3+3+3+2+2+3=19.

Respondent 13:
Scores: 3,3,2,1,2,2,2. Sum is 3+3+2+1+2+2+2=15.

Respondent 21:
Scores: 3,2,3,1,2,3,3. Sum is 3+2+3+1+2+3+3=17.

Respondent 10:
Scores: 2,2,2,2,2,2,2. Sum is 2*7=14.

Respondent 4:
Scores: 3,3,3,2,2,2,2. Sum is 3+3+3+2+2+2+2=17.

Now, let's list all totals:
- 11: 21
- 19: 20
- 14: 16
- 22: 19
- 13: 15
- 21: 17
- 10: 14
- 4: 17

Total sum = 21 + 20 +16 +19 +15 +17 +14 +17 = Let's calculate:

21+20=41; 41+16=57; 57+19=76; 76+15=91; 91+17=108; 108+14=122; 122+17=139.

There are 8 respondents. So average total score is 139 /8 = 17.375.

Now, find respondents with 'Clear' in their comments. Let's check each:

Respondent 11: Comments: ""Clear communication and handover"" → has 'Clear'.

Total score: 21. Compare to average 17.375. 21 is above, so exclude.

Respondent 19: Comments: ""Wrong CPR position Clarity is a bit low over whole case scenario Satisfactory"" → 'Clarity' is present, but the question is about 'Clear'. The word 'Clarity' is a different form. Wait, the exact wording is ""Clarity is a bit low"". The word 'Clear' isn't there. So this respondent does NOT have 'Clear' in comments. Wait, but the comment starts with ""Wrong CPR position Clarity is a bit low..."" Maybe the word 'Clarity' is present, but the instruction says to look for 'Clear'. So this one doesn't count.

Respondent 14: Comments mention ""Late response..."" No 'Clear' here.

Respondent 22: Comments: ""Clear communication skills Good"" → has 'Clear'.

Total score:19. 19 is above 17.375, so exclude.

Respondent 13: Comments don't mention 'Clear'.

Respondent 21: Comments: ""Diagnostic clarity is present Good..."" → 'clarity' again, not 'Clear'.

Respondent 10: Comments: ""Time: ..."" No 'Clear'.

Respondent 4: Comments: ""Clinical handover and communication skills, satisfactory..."" No 'Clear'.

Wait, so the only respondents with 'Clear' in comments are 11 and 22. But 11's total is 21 (above average) and 22's is 19 (also above average). Wait, but the average is 17.375. So 19 is above. So neither of them have a total below average. But wait, maybe I missed someone else.

Wait, let me check again. Are there any other respondents with 'Clear' in comments?

Looking at Respondent 19's comments again: ""Clarity is a bit low..."" 'Clarity' is a noun form, but the question is looking for 'Clear' as a substring. So that's not a match. So only 11 and 22 have 'Clear' in their comments.

But both have totals above the average. So the answer would be zero? But that seems odd. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the total scores. Let me recheck each respondent's total.

Respondent 11: All 3s. 7 items. 3*7=21. Correct.

Respondent 19: Identification 3, Situation 3, Background history 3, Background exam 3, Assessment 2, Recommendation (clear) 3, GRS 3. Sum: 3+3+3+3+2+3+3=20. Correct.

Respondent 14: 3,3,2,2,3,1,2. Sum: 3+3=6, +2=8, +2=10, +3=13, +1=14, +2=16. Correct.

Respondent 22: 3,3,3,3,2,2,3. Sum: 3+3=6, +3=9, +3=12, +2=14, +2=16, +3=19. Correct.

Respondent 13: 3,3,2,1,2,2,2. Sum: 3+3=6, +2=8, +1=9, +2=11, +2=13, +2=15. Correct.

Respondent 21: 3,2,3,1,2,3,3. Sum: 3+2=5, +3=8, +1=9, +2=11, +3=14, +3=17. Correct.

Respondent 10: 2,2,2,2,2,2,2. 2*7=14. Correct.

Respondent 4: 3,3,3,2,2,2,2. Sum: 3+3=6, +3=9, +2=11, +2=13, +2=15, +2=17. Correct.

Total sum is indeed 21+20+16+19+15+17+14+17= 21+20=41, +16=57, +19=76, +15=91, +17=108, +14=122, +17=139. Average is 139/8=17.375.

Now, respondents with 'Clear' in comments:

Respondent 11: ""Clear communication and handover"" → yes. Total 21 (above average).

Respondent 22: ""Clear communication skills Good"" → yes. Total 19 (above 17.375).

Any others? Let me check again.

Respondent 4's comments: ""Clinical handover and communication skills, satisfactory"" → no 'Clear'.

Respondent 19: ""Clarity is a bit low..."" → 'Clarity' is not 'Clear'.

So only two respondents have 'Clear' in comments, but both have total scores above the average. Therefore, the number of respondents meeting the criteria (comments contain 'Clear' and total below average) is zero.

Wait, but the example given in the problem had an answer of 2. But that was a different question. Wait, no, the example was about a different question. The current task is different.

But according to the data, the answer would be 0. But maybe I made a mistake in considering the 'Clear' keyword. Let me check again.

Wait, Respondent 19's comment: ""Clarity is a bit low over whole case scenario"". The word 'Clarity' is present, but the question is looking for 'Clear' as a substring. Since 'Clarity' contains 'clar' but not 'clear', maybe it's not a match. So 'Clarity' is not the same as 'Clear'. So only respondents 11 and 22 have 'Clear' in their comments.

But their totals are above average. So the answer is 0. But maybe I missed someone else. Let me check all comments again.

Respondent 21's comments: ""Diagnostic clarity is present"" → 'clarity' again, not 'Clear'.

Respondent 13: ""Lack of communication between 2 main interns"" → no.

Respondent 10: No.

Respondent 4: No.

So, no other respondents. Therefore, the answer is 0.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents whose comments contain 'Satisfactory' also have a total score across all rubric items that is below the average total score for all sessions?
</task>","Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking how many respondents have comments that include the word 'Satisfactory' and also have a total score below the average total score of all sessions. 

First, I need to understand the data structure. The data provided includes multiple respondents with various scores across different rubric items and comments. The task involves two main parts: calculating the total score for each respondent, finding the average total score across all sessions, then checking which respondents with 'Satisfactory' in their comments have totals below that average.

Let me start by listing all the respondents and their scores. Each respondent has several rubric items: Identification, Situation, Background (history), Background (examination), Assessment, Recommendation (clear recommendation), and Recommendation (global rating scale). Each of these is scored from 0 to 3, except for some entries that have negative values, like Respondent 1's Identification score of -1. Wait, but the rubric for Identification says 0 to 3. So maybe that's a typo? Hmm, but according to the data, Respondent 1 has Identification: -1. But the rubric for Identification is 0-3. That might be an error, but since the data shows -1, I have to take it as is. So their total would include that -1.

So first, I need to calculate the total score for each respondent. Let's go through each one:

Respondent 1:
Identification: -1
Situation: 2
Background (history): 2
Background (examination): 2
Assessment: 3
Recommendation (clear recommendation): 2
Recommendation (global rating scale): 2
Total: (-1) + 2 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 2 = Let's compute: (-1) +2=1, +2=3, +2=5, +3=8, +2=10, +2=12. So total 12.

Respondent 11:
All 3s except for the last two. Let's see:
Identification:3, Situation:3, History:3, Exam:3, Assessment:3, Clear Rec:3, GRS:3. Total: 3*7=21.

Respondent 6:
Identification:3, Situation:2, History:3, Exam:3, Assessment:2, Clear Rec:2, GRS:3. Total: 3+2+3+3+2+2+3= 3+2=5, +3=8, +3=11, +2=13, +2=15, +3=18.

Respondent 20:
Identification:3, Situation:3, History:2, Exam:-1, Assessment:3, Clear Rec:2, GRS:3. Total: 3+3=6, +2=8, -1=7, +3=10, +2=12, +3=15. So 15.

Respondent 15:
3 (ID) +3 (Sit) +2 (Hist) +3 (Exam) +2 (Assess) +2 (Rec) +2 (GRS) = 3+3=6, +2=8, +3=11, +2=13, +2=15, +2=17. Total 17.

Respondent 12:
3+3+3+3+2+3+3. Let's add: 3+3=6, +3=9, +3=12, +2=14, +3=17, +3=20. Total 20.

Respondent 3:
0 (ID) +2 (Sit) +3 (Hist) +3 (Exam) +3 (Assess) +3 (Rec) +3 (GRS). Total: 0+2=2, +3=5, +3=8, +3=11, +3=14, +3=17. So 17.

Respondent 14:
3+3+2+2+3+1+2. Let's compute: 3+3=6, +2=8, +2=10, +3=13, +1=14, +2=16. Total 16.

Respondent 16:
3+3+3+3+3+2+3. 3+3=6, +3=9, +3=12, +3=15, +2=17, +3=20. Total 20.

Respondent 2:
3+3+2+3+3+2+1. 3+3=6, +2=8, +3=11, +3=14, +2=16, +1=17. Total 17.

Respondent 4:
3+3+3+2+2+2+2. 3+3=6, +3=9, +2=11, +2=13, +2=15, +2=17. Total 17.

Now, let's list all the totals:

Respondent 1: 12
Respondent 11:21
Respondent 6:18
Respondent 20:15
Respondent 15:17
Respondent 12:20
Respondent 3:17
Respondent 14:16
Respondent 16:20
Respondent 2:17
Respondent 4:17

Now, calculate the average total score. Sum all these totals and divide by the number of respondents (11).

Sum: 12 +21=33, +18=51, +15=66, +17=83, +20=103, +17=120, +16=136, +20=156, +17=173, +17=190. Wait, let me recount:

Wait, the respondents are 1,11,6,20,15,12,3,14,16,2,4. That's 11 respondents.

Sum:

12 (R1)
+21 (R11) =33
+18 (R6)=51
+15 (R20)=66
+17 (R15)=83
+20 (R12)=103
+17 (R3)=120
+16 (R14)=136
+20 (R16)=156
+17 (R2)=173
+17 (R4)=190

Total sum: 190. Average: 190 /11 ≈17.27.

So the average total score is approximately 17.27.

Now, we need to find respondents whose comments include 'Satisfactory' and have a total score below 17.27.

Check each respondent's comments:

Respondent 1: Comments: ""Satisfactory"" → includes 'Satisfactory'. Total score 12, which is below 17.27. So this counts.

Respondent 11: Comments: ""Clear communication and handover"" → no 'Satisfactory'. So no.

Respondent 6: Comments: (empty) → no.

Respondent 20: Comments: ""Good"" → no.

Respondent 15: Comments: ""Detailed Response - clear communication"" → no 'Satisfactory'.

Respondent 12: Comments: ""Good"" → no.

Respondent 3: Comments: ""The patient/simulation is not oriented in TPP. Clear communication between Reg and colleague during handover"" → no 'Satisfactory'.

Respondent 14: Comments: ""Time: (2:36-2:53) Late response for considering consultation"" → no.

Respondent 16: Comments: ""Consent denied for video recordings Satisfactory"" → includes 'Satisfactory'. Total score 20, which is above 17.27. So doesn't count.

Respondent 2: Comments: (empty) → no.

Respondent 4: Comments: ""Clinical handover and communication skills, satisfactory No panic, no arrest team Satisfactory"" → includes 'satisfactory' (case-insensitive). The comment has 'satisfactory' twice. So yes. Now, check the total score: 17, which is below 17.27? 17 is less than 17.27. So yes, this counts.

Wait, but the average is approximately 17.27. So 17 is below that. So Respondent 4's total is 17, which is below the average.

Wait, but Respondent 1's total is 12, which is below. Respondent 16's total is 20, which is above. Respondent 4's total is 17, which is below 17.27. So that's two respondents: R1 and R4.

Wait, let me check again:

Respondent 1: Comments have 'Satisfactory' and total 12 → yes.

Respondent 4: Comments have 'satisfactory' (lowercase, but the question says 'contain 'Satisfactory''. The actual comment is ""Clinical handover and communication skills, satisfactory No panic, no arrest team Satisfactory"". So 'satisfactory' and 'Satisfactory' both present. So regardless of case, the keyword is present. So yes, included. Total 17, which is below 17.27.

So that's two respondents. Wait, but let me check other respondents:

Wait, Respondent 3's comments: ""Clear communication between Reg and colleague during handover"" → no 'Satisfactory'.

Respondent 15: ""Detailed Response - clear communication"" → no.

Respondent 16: ""Satisfactory"" in comments but total 20, which is above average.

Respondent 4: ""satisfactory"" and ""Satisfactory"" in comments. So yes, and total 17.

So total of two respondents: R1 and R4.

Wait, but let me check again all comments:

Looking through each:

R1: Satisfactory → yes.

R11: No.

R6: No.

R20: No.

R15: No.

R12: No.

R3: No.

R14: No.

R16: Satisfactory → yes, but total 20 (above average).

R2: No.

R4: ""satisfactory"" and ""Satisfactory"" → yes, total 17.

So R1 and R4. That's two respondents.

But wait, the answer in the example was 2. But let me confirm again.

Wait, the example's answer was 2 for a different question, but here the task is different. So according to the current analysis, the answer is 2. But let me check again.

Wait, R4's total is 17. The average is 17.27. So 17 is below 17.27. So yes, it counts. R1's total is 12, which is below. So two respondents. Therefore, the answer is 2.
