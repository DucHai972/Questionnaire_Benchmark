<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is """"[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"""" and the response is """"a"""", output """"Abnormal"""".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., """"42"""").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., """"17, 21, 23"""").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output """"Abnormal"""", not """"abnormal"""" or """"A"""").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is """"[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"""" and the response is """"a"""", output """"Abnormal"""".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., """"42"""").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., """"17, 21, 23"""").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is """"[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"""" and the response is """"a"""", output """"Abnormal"""".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., """"42"""").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., """"17, 21, 23"""").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output """"Abnormal"""", not """"abnormal"""" or """"A"""").

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is """"[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"""" and the response is """"a"""", output """"Abnormal"""".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., """"42"""").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is """"[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"""" and the response is """"a"""", output """"Abnormal"""".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., """"42"""").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., """"17, 21, 23"""").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output """"Abnormal"""", not """"abnormal"""" or """"A"""").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is """"[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"""" and the response is """"a"""", output """"Abnormal"""".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., """"42"""").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., """"17, 21, 23"""").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output """"Abnormal"""", not """"abnormal"""" or """"A"""").

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is """"[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"""" and the response is """"a"""", output """"Abnormal"""".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., """"42"""").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., """"17, 21, 23"""").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output """"Abnormal"""", not """"abnormal"""" or """"A"""").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is """"[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"""" and the response is """"a"""", output """"Abnormal"""".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., """"42"""").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., """"17, 21, 23"""").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output """"Abnormal"""", not """"abnormal"""" or """"A"""").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is """"[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"""" and the response is """"a"""", output """"Abnormal"""".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., """"42"""").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., """"17, 21, 23"""").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output """"Abnormal"""", not """"abnormal"""" or """"A"""").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is """"[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"""" and the response is """"a"""", output """"Abnormal"""".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., """"42"""").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., """"17, 21, 23"""").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output """"Abnormal"""", not """"abnormal"""" or """"A"""").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is """"[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"""" and the response is """"a"""", output """"Abnormal"""".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., """"42"""").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., """"17, 21, 23"""").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output """"Abnormal"""", not """"abnormal"""" or """"A"""").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is """"[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"""" and the response is """"a"""", output """"Abnormal"""".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., """"42"""").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., """"17, 21, 23"""").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output """"Abnormal"""", not """"abnormal"""" or """"A"""").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is """"[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"""" and the response is """"a"""", output """"Abnormal"""".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., """"42"""").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., """"17, 21, 23"""").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output """"Abnormal"""", not """"abnormal"""" or """"A"""").

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is """"[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"""" and the response is """"a"""", output """"Abnormal"""".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., """"42"""").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., """"17, 21, 23"""").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is """"[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"""" and the response is """"a"""", output """"Abnormal"""".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., """"42"""").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., """"17, 21, 23"""").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output """"Abnormal"""", not """"abnormal"""" or """"A"""").

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is """"[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"""" and the response is """"a"""", output """"Abnormal"""".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., """"42"""").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., """"17, 21, 23"""").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output """"Abnormal"""", not """"abnormal"""" or """"A"""").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is """"[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"""" and the response is """"a"""", output """"Abnormal"""".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., """"42"""").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., """"17, 21, 23"""").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output """"Abnormal"""", not """"abnormal"""" or """"A"""").

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is """"[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"""" and the response is """"a"""", output """"Abnormal"""".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., """"42"""").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., """"17, 21, 23"""").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output """"Abnormal"""", not """"abnormal"""" or """"A"""").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is """"[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"""" and the response is """"a"""", output """"Abnormal"""".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., """"42"""").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., """"17, 21, 23"""").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output """"Abnormal"""", not """"abnormal"""" or """"A"""").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is """"[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"""" and the response is """"a"""", output """"Abnormal"""".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., """"42"""").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., """"17, 21, 23"""").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output """"Abnormal"""", not """"abnormal"""" or """"A"""").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is """"[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"""" and the response is """"a"""", output """"Abnormal"""".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., """"42"""").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., """"17, 21, 23"""").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output """"Abnormal"""", not """"abnormal"""" or """"A"""").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is """"[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"""" and the response is """"a"""", output """"Abnormal"""".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., """"42"""").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., """"17, 21, 23"""").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output """"Abnormal"""", not """"abnormal"""" or """"A"""").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is """"[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"""" and the response is """"a"""", output """"Abnormal"""".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., """"42"""").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., """"17, 21, 23"""").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output """"Abnormal"""", not """"abnormal"""" or """"A"""").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is """"[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"""" and the response is """"a"""", output """"Abnormal"""".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., """"42"""").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., """"17, 21, 23"""").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output """"Abnormal"""", not """"abnormal"""" or """"A"""").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
How many respondents have a total positive usability score ('Ease_of_Use' + 'Integration_of_Functions') that is lower than the average for all respondents not in their group?
</task>","Here's the breakdown of the calculation:

**1. Calculate 'total positive usability score' for each respondent (Ease_of_Use + Integration_of_Functions):**
*   **Respondent 35 (Group A):** 1 + 1 = 2
*   **Respondent 54 (Group C):** 5 + 5 = 10
*   **Respondent 63 (Group C):** 5 + 5 = 10
*   **Respondent 33 (Group C):** 5 + 5 = 10
*   **Respondent 11 (Group A):** 5 + 5 = 10
*   **Respondent 39 (Group C):** 1 + 5 = 6
*   **Respondent 44 (Group B):** 5 + 2 = 7
*   **Respondent 3 (Group B):** 3 + 2 = 5
*   **Respondent 10 (Group D):** 4 + 5 = 9
*   **Respondent 62 (Group C):** 5 + 4 = 9

**2. For each respondent, calculate the average 'total positive usability score' of all other respondents *not in their group* and compare.**

*   **Respondent 35 (Group A, Score 2):**
    *   Respondents not in Group A: R54(10), R63(10), R33(10), R39(6), R44(7), R3(5), R10(9), R62(9)

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is """"[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"""" and the response is """"a"""", output """"Abnormal"""".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., """"42"""").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., """"17, 21, 23"""").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output """"Abnormal"""", not """"abnormal"""" or """"A"""").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is """"[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"""" and the response is """"a"""", output """"Abnormal"""".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., """"42"""").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., """"17, 21, 23"""").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output """"Abnormal"""", not """"abnormal"""" or """"A"""").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
