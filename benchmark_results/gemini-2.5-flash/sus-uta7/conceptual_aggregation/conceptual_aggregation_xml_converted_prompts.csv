<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is """"[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"""" and the response is """"a"""", output """"Abnormal"""".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., """"42"""").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., """"17, 21, 23"""").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output """"Abnormal"""", not """"abnormal"""" or """"A"""").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is """"[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"""" and the response is """"a"""", output """"Abnormal"""".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., """"42"""").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., """"17, 21, 23"""").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output """"Abnormal"""", not """"abnormal"""" or """"A"""").

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is """"[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"""" and the response is """"a"""", output """"Abnormal"""".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., """"42"""").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., """"17, 21, 23"""").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output """"Abnormal"""", not """"abnormal"""" or """"A"""").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is """"[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"""" and the response is """"a"""", output """"Abnormal"""".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., """"42"""").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., """"17, 21, 23"""").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output """"Abnormal"""", not """"abnormal"""" or """"A"""").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is """"[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"""" and the response is """"a"""", output """"Abnormal"""".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., """"42"""").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., """"17, 21, 23"""").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output """"Abnormal"""", not """"abnormal"""" or """"A"""").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is """"[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"""" and the response is """"a"""", output """"Abnormal"""".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., """"42"""").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., """"17, 21, 23"""").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output """"Abnormal"""", not """"abnormal"""" or """"A"""").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is """"[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"""" and the response is """"a"""", output """"Abnormal"""".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., """"42"""").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., """"17, 21, 23"""").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output """"Abnormal"""", not """"abnormal"""" or """"A"""").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is """"[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"""" and the response is """"a"""", output """"Abnormal"""".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., """"42"""").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., """"17, 21, 23"""").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output """"Abnormal"""", not """"abnormal"""" or """"A"""").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is """"[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"""" and the response is """"a"""", output """"Abnormal"""".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., """"42"""").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., """"17, 21, 23"""").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output """"Abnormal"""", not """"abnormal"""" or """"A"""").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is """"[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"""" and the response is """"a"""", output """"Abnormal"""".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., """"42"""").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., """"17, 21, 23"""").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output """"Abnormal"""", not """"abnormal"""" or """"A"""").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is """"[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"""" and the response is """"a"""", output """"Abnormal"""".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., """"42"""").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., """"17, 21, 23"""").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output """"Abnormal"""", not """"abnormal"""" or """"A"""").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is """"[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"""" and the response is """"a"""", output """"Abnormal"""".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., """"42"""").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., """"17, 21, 23"""").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output """"Abnormal"""", not """"abnormal"""" or """"A"""").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is """"[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"""" and the response is """"a"""", output """"Abnormal"""".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., """"42"""").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., """"17, 21, 23"""").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output """"Abnormal"""", not """"abnormal"""" or """"A"""").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is """"[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"""" and the response is """"a"""", output """"Abnormal"""".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., """"42"""").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., """"17, 21, 23"""").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output """"Abnormal"""", not """"abnormal"""" or """"A"""").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is """"[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"""" and the response is """"a"""", output """"Abnormal"""".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., """"42"""").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., """"17, 21, 23"""").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output """"Abnormal"""", not """"abnormal"""" or """"A"""").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is """"[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"""" and the response is """"a"""", output """"Abnormal"""".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., """"42"""").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., """"17, 21, 23"""").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output """"Abnormal"""", not """"abnormal"""" or """"A"""").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is """"[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"""" and the response is """"a"""", output """"Abnormal"""".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., """"42"""").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., """"17, 21, 23"""").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output """"Abnormal"""", not """"abnormal"""" or """"A"""").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is """"[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"""" and the response is """"a"""", output """"Abnormal"""".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., """"42"""").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., """"17, 21, 23"""").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output """"Abnormal"""", not """"abnormal"""" or """"A"""").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is """"[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"""" and the response is """"a"""", output """"Abnormal"""".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., """"42"""").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., """"17, 21, 23"""").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output """"Abnormal"""", not """"abnormal"""" or """"A"""").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is """"[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"""" and the response is """"a"""", output """"Abnormal"""".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., """"42"""").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., """"17, 21, 23"""").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output """"Abnormal"""", not """"abnormal"""" or """"A"""").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is """"[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"""" and the response is """"a"""", output """"Abnormal"""".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., """"42"""").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., """"17, 21, 23"""").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output """"Abnormal"""", not """"abnormal"""" or """"A"""").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is """"[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"""" and the response is """"a"""", output """"Abnormal"""".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., """"42"""").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., """"17, 21, 23"""").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output """"Abnormal"""", not """"abnormal"""" or """"A"""").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is """"[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"""" and the response is """"a"""", output """"Abnormal"""".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., """"42"""").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., """"17, 21, 23"""").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output """"Abnormal"""", not """"abnormal"""" or """"A"""").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is """"[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"""" and the response is """"a"""", output """"Abnormal"""".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., """"42"""").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., """"17, 21, 23"""").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output """"Abnormal"""", not """"abnormal"""" or """"A"""").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is """"[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"""" and the response is """"a"""", output """"Abnormal"""".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., """"42"""").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., """"17, 21, 23"""").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output """"Abnormal"""", not """"abnormal"""" or """"A"""").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is """"[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"""" and the response is """"a"""", output """"Abnormal"""".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., """"42"""").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., """"17, 21, 23"""").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output """"Abnormal"""", not """"abnormal"""" or """"A"""").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is """"[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"""" and the response is """"a"""", output """"Abnormal"""".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., """"42"""").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., """"17, 21, 23"""").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output """"Abnormal"""", not """"abnormal"""" or """"A"""").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is """"[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"""" and the response is """"a"""", output """"Abnormal"""".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., """"42"""").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., """"17, 21, 23"""").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output """"Abnormal"""", not """"abnormal"""" or """"A"""").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is """"[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"""" and the response is """"a"""", output """"Abnormal"""".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., """"42"""").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., """"17, 21, 23"""").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output """"Abnormal"""", not """"abnormal"""" or """"A"""").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is """"[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"""" and the response is """"a"""", output """"Abnormal"""".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., """"42"""").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., """"17, 21, 23"""").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output """"Abnormal"""", not """"abnormal"""" or """"A"""").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is """"[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"""" and the response is """"a"""", output """"Abnormal"""".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., """"42"""").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., """"17, 21, 23"""").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output """"Abnormal"""", not """"abnormal"""" or """"A"""").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is """"[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"""" and the response is """"a"""", output """"Abnormal"""".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., """"42"""").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., """"17, 21, 23"""").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output """"Abnormal"""", not """"abnormal"""" or """"A"""").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is """"[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"""" and the response is """"a"""", output """"Abnormal"""".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., """"42"""").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., """"17, 21, 23"""").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output """"Abnormal"""", not """"abnormal"""" or """"A"""").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is """"[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"""" and the response is """"a"""", output """"Abnormal"""".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., """"42"""").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., """"17, 21, 23"""").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output """"Abnormal"""", not """"abnormal"""" or """"A"""").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is """"[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"""" and the response is """"a"""", output """"Abnormal"""".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., """"42"""").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., """"17, 21, 23"""").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output """"Abnormal"""", not """"abnormal"""" or """"A"""").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is """"[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"""" and the response is """"a"""", output """"Abnormal"""".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., """"42"""").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., """"17, 21, 23"""").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output """"Abnormal"""", not """"abnormal"""" or """"A"""").

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is """"[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"""" and the response is """"a"""", output """"Abnormal"""".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., """"42"""").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., """"17, 21, 23"""").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output """"Abnormal"""", not """"abnormal"""" or """"A"""").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
How many respondents have a total positive usability score ('Ease_of_Use' + 'Integration_of_Functions') that is lower than the average for all respondents not in their group?
</task>","To determine the number of respondents who meet the criteria, we need to perform the following steps for each respondent:

1.  **Calculate the ""total positive usability score""**: This is the sum of 'Ease_of_Use' and 'Integration_of_Functions' for each respondent.
2.  **Identify the respondent's group**.
3.  **Calculate the average ""total positive usability score"" for all respondents *not* in that respondent's group.**
4.  **Compare the respondent's score to this calculated average.**
5.  **Count how many respondents have a score lower than this specific average.**

Let's first list each respondent's group and their calculated ""total positive usability score"":

*   **Respondent 35**: Group A, Ease_of_Use=1, Integration_of_Functions=1 -> Score = 1 + 1 = 2
*   **Respondent 54**: Group C, Ease_of_Use=5, Integration_of_Functions=5 -> Score = 5 + 5 = 10
*   **Respondent 63**: Group C, Ease_of_Use=5, Integration_of_Functions=5 -> Score = 5 + 5 = 10
*   **Respondent 33**: Group C, Ease_of_Use=5, Integration_of_Functions=5 -> Score = 5 + 5 = 10
*   **Respondent 11**: Group A, Ease_of_Use=5, Integration_of_Functions=5 -> Score = 5 + 5 = 10
*   **Respondent 39**: Group C, Ease_of_Use=1, Integration_of_Functions=5 -> Score = 1 + 5 = 6
*   **Respondent 44**: Group B, Ease_of_Use=5, Integration_of_Functions=2 -> Score = 5 + 2 = 7
*   **Respondent 3**: Group B, Ease_of_Use=3, Integration_of_Functions=2 -> Score = 3 + 2 = 5
*   **Respondent 10**: Group D, Ease_of_Use=4, Integration_of_Functions=5 -> Score = 4 + 5 = 9
*   **Respondent 62**: Group C, Ease_of_Use=5, Integration_of_Functions=4 -> Score = 5 + 4 = 9

Now, let's evaluate each respondent:

1.  **Respondent 35 (Group A, Score 2)**:
    *   Respondents not in Group A: R54(10), R63(10), R33(10), R39(6), R44(7), R3(5), R10(9), R62(9).
    *   Sum of scores for others = 10+10+10+6+7+5+9+9 = 66.
    *   Count of others = 8.
    *   Average for others = 66 / 8 = 8.25.
    *   Is 2 < 8.25? Yes. (Count = 1)

2.  **Respondent 54 (Group C, Score 10)**:
    *   Respondents not in Group C: R35(2), R11(10), R44(7), R3(5), R10(9).
    *   Sum of scores for others = 2+10+7+5+9 = 33.
    *   Count of others = 5.
    *   Average for others = 33 / 5 = 6.6.
    *   Is 10 < 6.6? No.

3.  **Respondent 63 (Group C, Score 10)**:
    *   Respondents not in Group C: R35(2), R11(10), R44(7), R3(5), R10(9).
    *   Sum of scores for others = 33.
    *   Count of others = 5.
    *   Average for others = 6.6.
    *   Is 10 < 6.6? No.

4.  **Respondent 33 (Group C, Score 10)**:
    *   Respondents not in Group C: R35(2), R11(10), R44(7), R3(5), R10(9).
    *   Sum of scores for others = 33.
    *   Count of others = 5.
    *   Average for others = 6.6.
    *   Is 10 < 6.6? No.

5.  **Respondent 11 (Group A, Score 10)**:
    *   Respondents not in Group A: R54(10), R63(10), R33(10), R39(6), R44(7), R3(5), R10(9), R62(9).
    *   Sum of scores for others = 66.
    *   Count of others = 8.
    *   Average for others = 8.25.
    *   Is 10 < 8.25? No.

6.  **Respondent 39 (Group C, Score 6)**:
    *   Respondents not in Group C: R35(2), R11(10), R44(7), R3(5), R10(9).
    *   Sum of scores for others = 33.
    *   Count of others = 5.
    *   Average for others = 6.6.
    *   Is 6 < 6.6? Yes. (Count = 2)

7.  **Respondent 44 (Group B, Score 7)**:
    *   Respondents not in Group B: R35(2), R54(10), R63(10), R33(10), R11(10), R39(6), R10(9), R62(9).
    *   Sum of scores for others = 2+10+10+10+10+6+9+9 = 66.
    *   Count of others = 8.
    *   Average for others = 66 / 8 = 8.25.
    *   Is 7 < 8.25? Yes. (Count = 3)

8.  **Respondent 3 (Group B, Score 5)**:
    *   Respondents not in Group B: R35(2), R54(10), R63(10), R33(10), R11(10), R39(6), R10(9), R62(9).
    *   Sum of scores for others = 66.
    *   Count of others = 8.
    *   Average for others = 8.25.
    *   Is 5 < 8.25? Yes. (Count = 4)

9.  **Respondent 10 (Group D, Score 9)**:
    *   Respondents not in Group D: R35(2), R54(10), R63(10), R33(10), R11(10), R39(6), R44(7), R3(5), R62(9).
    *   Sum of scores for others = 2+10+10+10+10+6+7+5+9 = 69.
    *   Count of others = 9.
    *   Average for others = 69 / 9 = 7.666...
    *   Is 9 < 7.666...? No.

10. **Respondent 62 (Group C, Score 9)**:
    *   Respondents not in Group C: R35(2), R11(10), R44(7), R3(5), R10(9).

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who are in a group where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score.
</task>","To answer the question, I need to perform the following steps:
1.  Group respondents by their 'Group' category.
2.  For each group, calculate the average 'System_Complexity' score.
3.  For each group, calculate the average 'Ease_of_Use' score.
4.  Compare these two averages for each group to see if the average 'System_Complexity' is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use'.
5.  Count the total number of respondents belonging to the groups that satisfy this condition.

**Step 1: Group respondents and extract relevant scores.**

*   **Group A (Senior):**
    *   Respondent 42: System_Complexity=1, Ease_of_Use=5
    *   Respondent 6: System_Complexity=1, Ease_of_Use=4
*   **Group B (Junior):**
    *   Respondent 66: System_Complexity=1, Ease_of_Use=5
    *   Respondent 36: System_Complexity=1, Ease_of_Use=5
*   **Group C (Middle):**
    *   Respondent 9: System_Complexity=3, Ease_of_Use=1
    *   Respondent 53: System_Complexity=1, Ease_of_Use=5
    *   Respondent 88: System_Complexity=2, Ease_of_Use=5
*   **Group D (Intern):**
    *   Respondent 45: System_Complexity=1, Ease_of_Use=4
    *   Respondent 15: System_Complexity=2, Ease_of_Use=4
    *   Respondent 71: System_Complexity=1, Ease_of_Use=5
    *   Respondent 7: System_Complexity=1, Ease_of_Use=5

**Step 2 & 3: Calculate average 'System_Complexity' (Avg_SC) and average 'Ease_of_Use' (Avg_EU) for each group.**

*   **Group A (Senior):**
    *   Avg_SC = (1 + 1) / 2 = 1
    *   Avg_EU = (5 + 4) / 2 = 4.5
*   **Group B (Junior):**
    *   Avg_SC = (1 + 1) / 2 = 1
    *   Avg_EU = (5 + 5) / 2 = 5
*   **Group C (Middle):**
    *   Avg_SC = (3 + 1 + 2) / 3 = 6 / 3 = 2
    *   Avg_EU = (1 + 5 + 5) / 3 = 11 / 3 ≈ 3.67
*   **Group D (Intern):**
    *   Avg_SC = (1 + 2 + 1 + 1) / 4 = 5 / 4 = 1.25
    *   Avg_EU = (4 + 4 + 5 + 5) / 4 = 18 / 4 = 4.5

**Step 4: Check the condition: Avg_SC > Avg_EU for each group.**

*   **Group A (Senior):** 1 > 4.5 ? False
*   **Group B (Junior):** 1 > 5 ? False
*   **Group C (Middle):** 2 > 3.67 ? False
*   **Group D (Intern):** 1.25 > 4.5 ? False

**Step 5: Count the respondents.**
No group satisfies the condition that the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score. Therefore, the count of respondents in such groups is 0.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
