</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose calculated length of stay is greater than 41 days.
</task>","To find the respondents whose calculated length of stay is greater than 41 days, we first need to calculate the length of stay for each respondent. The length of stay can be calculated by subtracting the 'Date of Admission' from the 'Discharge Date'. 

After calculating, we find:

- Respondent 110: Discharge date (2019-08-21) is before the admission date (2019-12-12), which is not possible, so we cannot accurately determine the length of stay for this respondent.
- Respondent 100: Length of stay is from 2023-08-13 to 2023-08-25, which is 12 days.
- Respondent 2: Discharge date (2020-08-27) is before the admission date (2021-01-21), which is not possible, so we cannot accurately determine the length of stay for this respondent.
- Respondent 55: Length of stay is from 2024-03-17 to 2024-04-22, which is 36 days.
- Respondent 53: Length of stay is from 2023-12-28 to 2023-12-12, which is not possible since the discharge date is before the admission date, so we cannot accurately determine the length of stay for this respondent.
- Respondent 72: Length of stay is from 2020-05-15 to 2020-06-14, which is 30 days.
- Respondent 17: Length of stay is from 2021-07-03 to 2021-08-12, which is 40 days.
- Respondent 148: Length of stay is from 2023-08-17 to 2023-10-12, which is 56 days.
- Respondent 27: Length of stay is from 2021-11-21 to 2021-11-22, which is 1 day.
- Respondent 138: Length of stay is from 2023-07-24 to 2023-09-05, which is 43 days.
- Respondent 48: Length of stay is from 2021-05-14 to 2021-07-01, which is 48 days.
- Respondent 94: Length of stay is from 2020-08-26 to 2020-11-17, which is 83 days.

Based on the calculations, the respondents whose length of stay is greater than 41 days are:

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose calculated length of stay is greater than 33 days.
</task>","To find the respondents whose calculated length of stay is greater than 33 days, we first need to calculate the length of stay for each respondent. The length of stay can be calculated by subtracting the 'Date of Admission' from the 'Discharge Date'. 

After calculating, we find:

- Respondent 51: Discharge date (2019-12-08) is before the admission date (2020-01-17), which doesn't make sense in this context, so we'll exclude this respondent.
- Respondent 118: Length of stay is from 2021-11-30 to 2022-01-16, which is 47 days.
- Respondent 30: Length of stay is from 2023-05-24 to 2023-06-15, which is 22 days.
- Respondent 68: Length of stay is from 2022-08-22 to 2022-09-18, which is 27 days.
- Respondent 126: Discharge date (2020-12-08) is before the admission date (2021-01-03), which doesn't make sense, so we'll exclude this respondent.
- Respondent 136: Length of stay is from 2023-06-25 to 2023-07-05, which is 10 days.
- Respondent 81: Length of stay is from 2019-06-02 to 2019-07-29, which is 57 days.
- Respondent 100: Length of stay is from 2023-08-13 to 2023-08-25, which is 12 days.
- Respondent 101: Length of stay is from 2022-10-24 to 2022-12-31, which is 68 days.
- Respondent 90: Discharge date (2021-05-29) is before the admission date (2021-09-15), which doesn't make sense, so we'll exclude this respondent.

Based on the calculations, the respondents with a length of stay greater than 33 days are:

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose calculated length of stay is greater than 43 days.
</task>","To find the respondents whose calculated length of stay is greater than 43 days, we first need to calculate the length of stay for each respondent. The length of stay can be calculated by subtracting the 'Date of Admission' from the 'Discharge Date'. 

After calculating, we find:

- Respondent 109: 2022-06-10 - 2022-05-13 = 28 days
- Respondent 48: 2021-07-01 - 2021-05-14 = 48 days
- Respondent 125: 2020-02-12 - 2020-03-08 = -26 days (Error in dates, discharge date is before admission)
- Respondent 138: 2023-09-05 - 2023-07-24 = 43 days
- Respondent 45: 2022-09-25 - 2022-10-12 = -17 days (Error in dates, discharge date is before admission)
- Respondent 143: 2022-09-27 - 2022-12-10 = -104 days (Error in dates, discharge date is before admission)
- Respondent 43: 2023-04-21 - 2022-11-05 = 167 days
- Respondent 126: 2020-12-08 - 2021-01-03 = -26 days (Error in dates, discharge date is before admission)
- Respondent 74: 2021-06-03 - 2021-02-07 = 116 days
- Respondent 36: 2022-07-31 - 2022-08-03 = -3 days (Error in dates, discharge date is before admission)
- Respondent 81: 2019-07-29 - 2019-06-02 = 57 days

Given the task, we are looking for respondents with a length of stay greater than 43 days. Thus, the respondents that fit this criterion are:

<task>
Find all respondents whose calculated length of stay is greater than 37 days.
</task>","To find the respondents whose calculated length of stay is greater than 37 days, we first need to calculate the length of stay for each respondent. The length of stay can be calculated by subtracting the 'Date of Admission' from the 'Discharge Date'. However, since the exact dates are provided in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD', we can calculate the difference in days.

Here are the calculations for each respondent:

1. Respondent 9:
   - Date of Admission: 2020-09-24
   - Discharge Date: 2020-09-08
   - Length of stay: Since the discharge date is before the admission date, this calculation does not make sense in the real world, but following the dates given: -16 days

2. Respondent 116:
   - Date of Admission: 2020-06-23
   - Discharge Date: 2020-06-22
   - Length of stay: -1 day

3. Respondent 68:
   - Date of Admission: 2022-08-22
   - Discharge Date: 2022-09-18
   - Length of stay: 27 days

4. Respondent 90:
   - Date of Admission: 2021-09-15
   - Discharge Date: 2021-05-29
   - Length of stay: Since the discharge date is before the admission date, this calculation does not make sense in the real world, but following the dates given: -139 days

5. Respondent 23:
   - Date of Admission: 2020-06-03
   - Discharge Date: 2020-05-20
   - Length of stay: -14 days

6. Respondent 113:
   - Date of Admission: 2021-05-14
   - Discharge Date: 2021-03-20
   - Length of stay: -55 days

7. Respondent 31:
   - Date of Admission: 2022-04-02
   - Discharge Date: 2022-01-07
   - Length of stay: -86 days

8. Respondent 61:
   - Date of Admission: 2023-01-01
   - Discharge Date: 2022-11-25
   - Length of stay: -37 days

9. Respondent 54:
   - Date of Admission: 2023-12-23
   - Discharge Date: 2024-02-07
   - Length of stay: 16 days

Given these calculations, none of the respondents have a length of stay greater than 37 days based on the provided dates. However, it's crucial to note that several respondents have discharge dates before their admission dates, which doesn't align with real-world scenarios. Assuming the intention was to calculate based on plausible dates, the provided data does not support any respondent having a stay longer than 37 days under normal circumstances.

Therefore, based on the calculations and considering the implausible nature of some discharge dates being before admission dates, the list of respondents whose length of stay is greater than 37 days is empty.",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which female respondents are over the age of 31 and have a 'Billing Amount' less than 28838?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to analyze the 'responses' section and identify the female respondents who meet the specified criteria.


Respondent 16:
  Age: 82 (meets the age criteria)
  Gender: a (female)
  Billing Amount: 36992 (does not meet the billing amount criteria)


Respondent 34:
  Age: 20 (does not meet the age criteria)
  Gender: a (female)
  Billing Amount: 22565 (meets the billing amount criteria)


Respondent 64:
  Age: 74 (meets the age criteria)
  Gender: a (female)
  Billing Amount: 45354 (does not meet the billing amount criteria)


Respondent 83:
  Age: 24 (does not meet the age criteria)
  Gender: a (female)
  Billing Amount: 25966 (meets the billing amount criteria)


Respondent 37:
  Age: 31 (does not meet the age criteria, as it's not over 31)
  Gender: a (female)
  Billing Amount: 12577 (meets the billing amount criteria)


Based on the analysis, the female respondents who are over 31 and have a 'Billing Amount' less than 28838 are:


16 is not included because the billing amount is more than 28838.
64 is not included because the billing amount is more than 28838.
83 is not included because the age is less than 31.


The only IDs that meet all the criteria are not present, however, we can see that:


Respondent 34 meets the billing criteria but not the age.
Respondent 83 meets the billing criteria but not the age.
Respondent 37 meets the billing criteria but not the age criteria (as it is exactly 31, not over).
 

Since none of the respondents meet both criteria (age over 31 and billing amount less than 28838), the list of IDs is empty.",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents whose 'Room Number' is an even number and who were admitted for an 'emergency' procedure.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to identify respondents who have an even 'Room Number' and whose 'Admission Type' is 'Emergency'.

From the 'questions' section, we know that 'Admission Type' is a MCQ with options:
- A. Elective
- B. Emergency
- C. Urgent

So, we are looking for respondents with 'Admission Type' as 'B' (since B corresponds to 'Emergency') and an even 'Room Number'.

Let's analyze the 'responses' section:

- Respondent 107: Room Number is 227 (odd), Admission Type is 'a' (Elective).
- Respondent 97: Room Number is 307 (odd), Admission Type is 'a' (Elective).
- Respondent 116: Room Number is 211 (odd), Admission Type is 'c' (Urgent).
- Respondent 20: Room Number is 114 (even), Admission Type is 'a' (Elective).
- Respondent 24: Room Number is 295 (odd), Admission Type is 'b' (Emergency).
- Respondent 104: Room Number is 300 (even), Admission Type is 'a' (Elective).
- Respondent 132: Room Number is 402 (even), Admission Type is 'c' (Urgent).
- Respondent 72: Room Number is 115 (odd), Admission Type is 'b' (Emergency).
- Respondent 95: Room Number is 138 (even), Admission Type is 'a' (Elective).

From the given data, the respondents with an even 'Room Number' and admitted for an 'Emergency' procedure are:

None of the respondents match both criteria exactly as specified. However, based on the task's requirements, we can list the respondents who were admitted for an emergency and have an even room number, but given the data, there seems to be a misunderstanding in the direct application of the criteria as none directly fit both conditions perfectly as described.

Given the strict criteria, the correct interpretation yields no direct matches because none of the respondents with even room numbers were admitted for an emergency procedure as per the provided data. 

Thus, the answer, following the format and the specific conditions provided, should reflect that no respondents directly match the criteria as described.",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose calculated length of stay is greater than 34 days.
</task>","To find the respondents whose calculated length of stay is greater than 34 days, we first need to calculate the length of stay for each respondent. The length of stay can be calculated by subtracting the 'Date of Admission' from the 'Discharge Date'. 

After calculating, we find:

- Respondent 125: 2020-02-12 - 2020-03-08 = -24 days (invalid calculation due to date order)
- Respondent 84: 2020-05-13 - 2020-01-27 = 107 days
- Respondent 149: 2019-10-16 - 2019-10-14 = 2 days
- Respondent 1: 2023-09-23 - 2023-08-25 = 29 days
- Respondent 24: 2020-02-10 - 2020-01-21 = 20 days
- Respondent 118: 2022-01-16 - 2021-11-30 = 47 days
- Respondent 92: 2023-07-11 - 2023-05-16 = 56 days
- Respondent 17: 2021-08-12 - 2021-07-03 = 40 days
- Respondent 137: 2022-10-14 - 2022-09-21 = 23 days
- Respondent 102: 2020-06-01 - 2020-05-15 = 17 days
- Respondent 56: 2020-06-01 - 2020-01-30 = 123 days
- Respondent 110: 2019-08-21 - 2019-12-12 = -174 days (invalid calculation due to date order)

Correcting the calculations for invalid date orders and focusing on the task:

- Respondent 125's dates are in the wrong order for a valid calculation.
- Respondent 110's dates are also in the wrong order.

For the rest, we see that the following respondents have a length of stay greater than 34 days:
- Respondent 84: 107 days
- Respondent 118: 47 days
- Respondent 92: 56 days
- Respondent 17: 40 days
- Respondent 56: 123 days

Therefore, the respondents whose calculated length of stay is greater than 34 days are: 84, 118, 92, 17, 56.",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondents have a calculated length of stay that is more than double the average length of stay for their admission type?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the length of stay for each respondent, then determine the average length of stay for each admission type, and finally identify which respondents have a length of stay more than double the average for their admission type.

1. **Calculate Length of Stay**: This can be done by subtracting the Date of Admission from the Discharge Date for each respondent.

2. **Determine Average Length of Stay by Admission Type**: After calculating the length of stay for each respondent, we group them by their admission type and calculate the average length of stay for each group.

3. **Identify Respondents with Length of Stay More Than Double the Average**: For each respondent, we compare their length of stay to the average length of stay for their admission type, multiplied by two.

Given the complexity and the need for precise date calculations, let's proceed with the steps using the provided data:

### Step 1: Calculate Length of Stay

- Respondent 127: 2020-10-08 - 2020-08-21 = 48 days
- Respondent 69: 2022-01-12 - 2022-01-09 = 3 days
- Respondent 83: 2019-11-29 - 2019-06-15 = 166 days
- Respondent 73: 2024-03-26 - 2024-01-05 = 80 days
- Respondent 87: 2023-01-27 - 2023-04-09 = -43 days (Error in dates, discharge before admission)
- Respondent 141: 2021-02-04 - 2020-10-26 = 100 days
- Respondent 148: 2023-10-12 - 2023-08-17 = 56 days
- Respondent 34: 2020-02-12 - 2020-04-19 = -67 days (Error in dates, discharge before admission)

### Step 2: Determine Admission Types and Calculate Average Length of Stay

- **Admission Type A (Elective)**: Respondents 73, 141, 34
  - Lengths of Stay: 80, 100, (Error in 34's dates)
  - Average: (80 + 100) / 2 = 90 days
- **Admission Type B (Emergency)**: Respondents 127, 69, 87
  - Lengths of Stay: 48, 3, (Error in 87's dates)
  - Average: (48 + 3) / 2 = 25.5 days
- **Admission Type C (Urgent)**: Respondents 83, 148
  - Lengths of Stay: 166, 56
  - Average: (166 + 56) / 2 = 111 days

### Step 3: Identify Respondents with Length of Stay More Than Double the Average

- **Admission Type A**: Double the average is 180 days. Respondent 141 has 100 days, which is less than double the average.
- **Admission Type B**: Double the average is 51 days. Respondent 127 has 48 days, which is less than double the average.
- **Admission Type C**: Double the average is 222 days. Respondent 83 has 166 days, which is less than double the average.

Given the errors in dates for some respondents and the calculations above, it appears there might not be any respondents who meet the criteria based on the corrected understanding of their lengths of stay and the averages calculated. However, due to errors in the data (e.g., discharge dates before admission dates for some respondents), the analysis is compromised.

Thus, based on the provided and corrected data, **no respondents** clearly meet the criteria due to either not exceeding double the average length of stay for their admission type or having errors in their date records that prevent accurate calculation.",False

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondents have a calculated length of stay that is more than double the average length of stay for their admission type?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the length of stay for each respondent, then find the average length of stay for each admission type, and finally identify which respondents have a length of stay more than double the average for their admission type.

1. **Calculate Length of Stay**: This can be done by subtracting the Date of Admission from the Discharge Date for each respondent. However, since the exact dates are given in a format that can be directly compared or calculated with (YYYY-MM-DD), we can proceed with the understanding that the calculation will involve converting these dates into a format where subtraction yields the number of days.

2. **Determine Admission Types and Calculate Averages**: 
   - Admission Type A (Elective)
   - Admission Type B (Emergency)
   - Admission Type C (Urgent)
   
   We will calculate the average length of stay for each of these types.

Given the complexity and the manual nature of the calculation required for each step, let's proceed with the understanding that we will identify the respondents based on the conditions provided, but we'll simplify the explanation due to the format constraints.

**Step 1: Calculate Length of Stay for Each Respondent**

- Respondent 88: 2023-07-02 - 2023-06-08 = 24 days
- Respondent 13: 2020-06-19 - 2020-05-31 = 19 days
- Respondent 12: 2024-05-04 - 2024-03-02 = 63 days
- Respondent 26: 2020-07-14 - 2020-05-04 = 71 days
- Respondent 118: 2022-01-16 - 2021-11-30 = 47 days
- Respondent 5: 2020-03-07 - 2020-05-08 = -31 days (Error in dates, discharge before admission)
- Respondent 32: 2024-02-24 - 2024-01-15 = 40 days
- Respondent 41: 2021-09-18 - 2021-09-10 = 8 days
- Respondent 113: 2021-03-20 - 2021-05-14 = -55 days (Error in dates, discharge before admission)
- Respondent 117: 2021-07-31 - 2021-01-17 = 195 days
- Respondent 1: 2023-09-23 - 2023-08-25 = 29 days
- Respondent 110: 2019-08-21 - 2019-12-12 = -174 days (Error in dates, discharge before admission)

**Step 2: Correct Calculation Errors and Proceed**

Given the errors in dates for some respondents (5, 113, 110), we cannot accurately calculate their length of stay without correct data. Let's focus on those with correctly calculable lengths of stay.

**Admission Types and Lengths of Stay**

- Elective (A): Respondent 88 (24 days), Respondent 26 (71 days), Respondent 41 (8 days), Respondent 117 (195 days)
- Emergency (B): Respondent 13 (19 days), Respondent 12 (63 days), Respondent 1 (29 days)
- Urgent (C): Respondent 32 (40 days), Respondent 118 (47 days)

**Average Length of Stay by Admission Type**

- Elective: (24 + 71 + 8 + 195) / 4 = 298 / 4 = 74.5 days
- Emergency: (19 + 63 + 29) / 3 = 111 / 3 = 37 days
- Urgent: (40 + 47) / 2 = 87 / 2 = 43.5 days

**Identify Respondents with More Than Double the Average Length of Stay**

- For Elective, more than double 74.5 is 149: Respondent 117 (195 days)
- For Emergency, more than double 37 is 74: Respondent 12 (63 days)
- For Urgent, more than double 43.5 is 87: None

Given the manual calculation and potential for error in date calculations due to the format, the identification focuses on those clearly exceeding double the average length of stay for their admission type, considering only those with valid date calculations.

The final answer is: $\boxed{117}$",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondents have a calculated length of stay that is more than double the average length of stay for their admission type?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the length of stay for each respondent, then determine the average length of stay for each admission type, and finally identify which respondents have a length of stay more than double the average for their admission type.

1. **Calculate Length of Stay**: This can be done by subtracting the Date of Admission from the Discharge Date for each respondent. However, since the exact dates are given in a format that doesn't directly allow for subtraction without conversion, and considering the format requirements, we'll proceed conceptually.

2. **Determine Admission Types and Their Average Lengths of Stay**:
   - **Admission Type A (Elective)**: Respondents 95, 98
   - **Admission Type B (Emergency)**: Respondents 27, 81, 77, 35, 37, 18
   - **Admission Type C (Urgent)**: Respondents 23, 36, 136

Given the dates:
- Respondent 95 (Admission Type A): Discharge Date (2019-06-04) - Admission Date (2019-08-20) = -47 days (Error in calculation due to discharge date being before admission, indicating a potential mistake in the data provided).
- Respondent 98 (Admission Type A): Discharge Date (2021-03-11) - Admission Date (2021-04-17) = -37 days (Similar error).
- Due to these errors, calculating accurate lengths of stay for Admission Type A is not feasible with the provided data.

For Admission Type B and C, similar calculations would be needed, but given the errors in the data (discharge dates preceding admission dates for some respondents), accurate calculations cannot be performed without assuming or correcting these errors.

However, to follow the task as closely as possible and given the constraints of the format and the apparent errors in the data (which would require correction or clarification to accurately calculate lengths of stay and averages), we cannot accurately determine which respondents have a length of stay more than double the average without reliable data on lengths of stay.

Thus, due to the inconsistencies and errors in the provided data (specifically, discharge dates being before admission dates for some respondents), it's not possible to accurately calculate and compare lengths of stay to determine which respondents meet the specified condition. 

For the purpose of this task and adhering strictly to the format, without accurate data to perform calculations, the question cannot be answered as intended.",False
