</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose 'Billing Amount' is less than 30000.
</task>","To solve this task, I will carefully examine the 'responses' section and compare the 'Billing Amount' for each respondent to the threshold of 30000.

Respondent 55: Billing Amount = 32562 (greater than 30000)
Respondent 52: Billing Amount = 2679 (less than 30000)
Respondent 138: Billing Amount = 7556 (less than 30000)
Respondent 70: Billing Amount = 32643 (greater than 30000)
Respondent 144: Billing Amount = 16320 (less than 30000)
Respondent 36: Billing Amount = 24500 (less than 30000)
Respondent 28: Billing Amount = 5767 (less than 30000)
Respondent 62: Billing Amount = 44437 (greater than 30000)
Respondent 63: Billing Amount = 19973 (less than 30000)
Respondent 13: Billing Amount = 23685 (less than 30000)
Respondent 136: Billing Amount = 4398 (less than 30000)
Respondent 58: Billing Amount = 37952 (greater than 30000)

Counting the respondents with 'Billing Amount' less than 30000:

- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents with 'Gender' = 'Female' and 'Medication' = 'Aspirin'.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to analyze the 'responses' section based on the 'questions' schema provided.

The 'questions' schema tells us:
- For 'Gender', A corresponds to 'Female' and B corresponds to 'Male'.
- For 'Medication', A corresponds to 'Aspirin'.

We then examine each respondent's data:
- Respondent 147: Gender = 'a' (Female), Medication = 'e' (not Aspirin)
- Respondent 60: Gender = 'b' (Male), Medication = 'e' (not Aspirin)
- Respondent 137: Gender = 'b' (Male), Medication = 'b' (not Aspirin)
- Respondent 10: Gender = 'b' (Male), Medication = 'b' (not Aspirin)
- Respondent 45: Gender = 'a' (Female), Medication = 'a' (Aspirin)
- Respondent 107: Gender = 'a' (Female), Medication = 'a' (Aspirin)

From the analysis, we find that Respondents 45 and 107 are the ones with 'Gender' = 'Female' and 'Medication' = 'Aspirin'.

Therefore, the count of respondents with 'Gender' = 'Female' and 'Medication' = 'Aspirin' is 2.",

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

Count the respondents with 'Medication' = 'Ibuprofen' and 'Test Results' = 'Normal'.

From the provided data:

- Respondent 86 has 'Medication' = 'b' (Ibuprofen) and 'Test Results' = 'c' (Normal).
- Respondent 73 has 'Medication' = 'c' (not Ibuprofen) and 'Test Results' = 'c' (Normal).
- Respondent 117 has 'Medication' = 'd' (not Ibuprofen) and 'Test Results' = 'b' (not Normal).
- Respondent 140 has 'Medication' = 'e' (not Ibuprofen) and 'Test Results' = 'a' (not Normal).

- Respondent 127 has 'Medication' = 'e' (not Ibuprofen) and 'Test Results' = 'b' (not Normal).

Therefore, the respondents with 'Medication' = 'Ibuprofen' and 'Test Results' = 'Normal' are Respondent 86 and Respondent 135.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents with 'Medical Condition' = 'Diabetes' and 'Insurance Provider' = 'Medicare'.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to identify respondents who have 'Medical Condition' as 'Diabetes' and 'Insurance Provider' as 'Medicare'. 

From the 'questions' section, we know:
- 'Medical Condition' is a MCQ with options A. Arthritis, B. Asthma, C. Cancer, D. Diabetes, E. Hypertension, F. Obesity. So, 'Diabetes' corresponds to option 'D'.
- 'Insurance Provider' is a MCQ with options A. Aetna, B. Blue Cross, C. Cigna, D. Medicare, E. UnitedHealthcare. So, 'Medicare' corresponds to option 'D'.

Now, let's examine the 'responses' section to find respondents who match both conditions:

- Respondent 130: Medical Condition is 'd' (which means Diabetes), and Insurance Provider is 'd' (which means Medicare). This respondent matches.
- Respondent 120: Medical Condition is 'b' (which means Asthma), and Insurance Provider is 'a' (which means Aetna). This respondent does not match.
- Respondent 70: Medical Condition is 'd' (which means Diabetes), and Insurance Provider is 'd' (which means Medicare). This respondent matches.
- Respondent 50: Medical Condition is 'd' (which means Diabetes), and Insurance Provider is 'a' (which means Aetna). This respondent does not match.
- Respondent 29: Medical Condition is 'c' (which means Cancer), and Insurance Provider is 'd' (which means Medicare). This respondent does not match.
- Respondent 85: Medical Condition is 'c' (which means Cancer), and Insurance Provider is 'd' (which means Medicare). This respondent does not match.
- Respondent 42: Medical Condition is 'c' (which means Cancer), and Insurance Provider is 'c' (which means Cigna). This respondent does not match.

From the given data, only Respondent 130 and Respondent 70 have 'Medical Condition' = 'Diabetes' and 'Insurance Provider' = 'Medicare'.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$",

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents with a 'Gender' of 'Female'.
</task>","To accurately count the respondents with a 'Gender' of 'Female', we must refer to the 'questions' section to understand how 'Female' is represented in the data. According to the schema, 'Gender' is a multiple-choice question with options A. Female and B. Male. Thus, in the 'responses' section, 'Female' is represented by the letter 'a' (case-insensitive).

Now, let's examine each respondent's 'Gender' in the 'responses' section:

1. Respondent 24: Gender - a (Female)
2. Respondent 131: Gender - b (Male)
3. Respondent 115: Gender - b (Male)
4. Respondent 15: Gender - a (Female)
5. Respondent 117: Gender - a (Female)
6. Respondent 34: Gender - a (Female)
7. Respondent 132: Gender - a (Female)
8. Respondent 107: Gender - a (Female)
9. Respondent 145: Gender - b (Male)
10. Respondent 144: Gender - a (Female)
11. Respondent 119: Gender - a (Female)
12. Respondent 79: Gender - a (Female)

Counting the respondents with 'Gender' = 'Female' (represented by 'a'):

1. Respondent 24
2. Respondent 15
3. Respondent 117
4. Respondent 34
5. Respondent 132
6. Respondent 107
7. Respondent 144
8. Respondent 119
9. Respondent 79

There are 9 respondents with a 'Gender' of 'Female'.",

<task>
Count the respondents with 'Medication' = 'Lipitor' and 'Gender' = 'Male' who have a 'Age' greater 50.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to follow the instructions carefully and analyze the provided data.

First, let's identify the relevant fields and their corresponding values in the 'questions' section:

- 'Medication' is a MCQ field with options: A. Aspirin B. Ibuprofen C. Lipitor D. Paracetamol E. Penicillin
- 'Gender' is a MCQ field with options: A. Female B. Male
- 'Age' is an open-ended field.

We are looking for respondents with 'Medication' = 'Lipitor', 'Gender' = 'Male', and 'Age' greater than 50.

Let's examine the 'responses' section:

- Respondent 121: Medication = c (Lipitor), Gender = a (Female), Age = 76. This respondent does not match the 'Gender' criteria.
- Respondent 9: Medication = c (Lipitor), Gender = a (Female), Age = 45. This respondent does not match the 'Gender' and 'Age' criteria.
- Respondent 74: Medication = a (Aspirin), Gender = b (Male), Age = 83. This respondent does not match the 'Medication' criteria but matches the 'Gender' and 'Age' criteria.
- Respondent 105: Medication = b (Ibuprofen), Gender = b (Male), Age = 54. This respondent does not match the 'Medication' criteria but matches the 'Gender' and 'Age' criteria.
- Respondent 47: Medication = b (Ibuprofen), Gender = b (Male), Age = 62. This respondent does not match the 'Medication' criteria but matches the 'Gender' and 'Age' criteria.
- Respondent 35: Medication = e (Penicillin), Gender = b (Male), Age = 61. This respondent does not match the 'Medication' criteria but matches the 'Gender' and 'Age' criteria.

However, upon re-examining the data, we find that none of the male respondents with an age greater than 50 are taking 'Lipitor'.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose calculated length of stay is between 5 and 10 days and who have 'Insurance Provider' = 'Aetna'.
</task>","To calculate the length of stay, we need to subtract the 'Date of Admission' from the 'Discharge Date'. Since the dates are in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD', we can calculate the difference in days.

After analyzing the data, we found the following respondents with 'Insurance Provider' = 'Aetna' and calculated length of stay between 5 and 10 days:

Respondent 90: 
  Date of Admission: 2021-09-15
  Discharge Date: 2021-05-29
  Since the discharge date is before the admission date, this respondent is not valid for the calculation.

Respondent 138: 
  Date of Admission: 2023-07-24
  Discharge Date: 2023-09-05
  Length of stay: 12 days (not between 5 and 10 days)

Respondent 46: 
  Date of Admission: 2023-12-20
  Discharge Date: 2023-10-27
  Since the discharge date is before the admission date, this respondent is not valid for the calculation.

Respondent 96: 
  Date of Admission: 2022-07-24
  Discharge Date: 2022-07-18
  Since the discharge date is before the admission date, this respondent is not valid for the calculation.

Respondent 31: 
  Date of Admission: 2022-04-02
  Discharge Date: 2022-01-07
  Since the discharge date is before the admission date, this respondent is not valid for the calculation.

Respondent 97: 
  Date of Admission: 2020-07-01
  Discharge Date: 2020-03-05
  Since the discharge date is before the admission date, this respondent is not valid for the calculation.

Respondent 21: 
  Date of Admission: 2021-11-13
  Discharge Date: 2021-08-19
  Since the discharge date is before the admission date, this respondent is not valid for the calculation.

Respondent 35: 
  Date of Admission: 2019-11-21
  Discharge Date: 2019-12-28
  Length of stay: 37 days (not between 5 and 10 days)

Respondent 98: 
  Date of Admission: 2021-04-17
  Discharge Date: 2021-03-11
  Since the discharge date is before the admission date, this respondent is not valid for the calculation.

Respondent 115: 
  Date of Admission: 2021-07-30
  Discharge Date: 2021-12-09
  Length of stay: 132 days (not between 5 and 10 days)

Respondent 139: 
  Date of Admission: 2024-02-06
  Discharge Date: 2024-02-03
  Since the discharge date is before the admission date, this respondent is not valid for the calculation.

Only Respondent 90 and Respondent 138 have 'Insurance Provider' = 'Aetna'. However, none of them have a length of stay between 5 and 10 days.

The final answer is: 0",

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose calculated length of stay is between 7 and 12 days and who have 'Blood Type' = 'O+'.
</task>","To calculate the length of stay, we need to subtract the 'Date of Admission' from the 'Discharge Date'. Since the dates are in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD', we can calculate the difference in days.

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents with 'Gender' = 'Male' and 'Medication' = 'Lipitor' who have a 'Age' less 60.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to follow the instructions carefully and analyze the provided data.

First, let's identify the relevant fields and their corresponding values in the 'questions' section:
- 'Gender' is a MCQ field with options A. Female and B. Male.
- 'Medication' is a MCQ field with options A. Aspirin, B. Ibuprofen, C. Lipitor, D. Paracetamol, and E. Penicillin.
- 'Age' is an open-ended field.

We are looking for respondents who are 'Male', take 'Lipitor' as their medication, and are less than 60 years old.

Let's examine the 'responses' section:
- Respondent 5: Gender = Female, Medication = Lipitor (since 'c' corresponds to Lipitor), Age = 54. Does not match because the gender is Female.
- Respondent 62: Gender = Male, Medication = Ibuprofen, Age = 27. Does not match because the medication is not Lipitor.
- Respondent 53: Gender = Male, Medication = Ibuprofen, Age = 38. Does not match because the medication is not Lipitor.
- Respondent 18: Gender = Male, Medication = Aspirin, Age = 19. Does not match because the medication is not Lipitor.
- Respondent 26: Gender = Female, Medication = Ibuprofen, Age = 48. Does not match because the gender is Female and the medication is not Lipitor.
- Respondent 9: Gender = Female, Medication = Lipitor, Age = 45. Does not match because the gender is Female.
- Respondent 115: Gender = Male, Medication = Lipitor, Age = 82. Does not match because the age is greater than 60.
- Respondent 13: Gender = Male, Medication = Aspirin, Age = 46. Does not match because the medication is not Lipitor.
- Respondent 63: Gender = Male, Medication = Ibuprofen, Age = 43. Does not match because the medication is not Lipitor.
- Respondent 12: Gender = Male, Medication = Ibuprofen, Age = 20. Does not match because the medication is not Lipitor.
- Respondent 103: Gender = Male, Medication = Penicillin, Age = 81. Does not match because the medication is not Lipitor and the age is greater than 60.

None of the respondents match all the criteria of being Male, taking Lipitor, and being less than 60 years old.

The final answer is: 0",

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents with 'Gender' = 'Male' and 'Admission Type' = 'Urgent' who have a 'Billing Amount' greater 30000.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to carefully examine the 'responses' section and apply the filters as specified.

1. **Gender = 'Male'**: According to the schema, 'Male' is represented by 'B'. So, we are looking for respondents with 'Gender' = 'b' (case-insensitive).
2. **Admission Type = 'Urgent'**: The schema indicates 'Urgent' is represented by 'C'. Thus, we need 'Admission Type' = 'c'.
3. **Billing Amount > 30000**: We will look for 'Billing Amount' values greater than 30000.

Let's go through the respondents:

- Respondent 60: Gender = 'b' (Male), Admission Type = 'b' (not Urgent), Billing Amount = 37735. Does not match because Admission Type is not 'Urgent'.
- Respondent 139: Gender is missing, so this respondent does not match.
- Respondent 56: Gender = 'b' (Male), Admission Type = 'c' (Urgent), Billing Amount = 19747. Does not match because Billing Amount is not greater than 30000.
- Respondent 15: Gender = 'a' (Female), so this respondent does not match.
- Respondent 36: Gender = 'b' (Male), Admission Type = 'c' (Urgent), Billing Amount = 24500. Does not match because Billing Amount is not greater than 30000.
- Respondent 129: Gender = 'a' (Female), so this respondent does not match.
- Respondent 75: Gender = 'a' (Female), so this respondent does not match.
- Respondent 148: Gender = 'b' (Male), Admission Type = 'c' (Urgent), Billing Amount = 28838. Matches all criteria.
- Respondent 82: Gender = 'b' (Male), Admission Type = 'a' (not Urgent), Billing Amount = 47985. Does not match because Admission Type is not 'Urgent'.
- Respondent 83: Gender = 'a' (Female), so this respondent does not match.
- Respondent 61: Gender = 'b' (Male), Admission Type = 'a' (not Urgent), Billing Amount = 23500. Does not match because Admission Type is not 'Urgent' and Billing Amount is not greater than 30000.
- Respondent 78: Gender = 'b' (Male), Admission Type = 'c' (Urgent), Billing Amount = 23068. Does not match because Billing Amount is not greater than 30000.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose calculated length of stay is between 10 and 15 days and who have 'Admission Type' = 'Emergency'.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the length of stay for each respondent and then filter those with an 'Admission Type' of 'Emergency' and a length of stay between 10 and 15 days.

1. Calculate the length of stay: This can be done by subtracting the 'Date of Admission' from the 'Discharge Date' for each respondent. However, since the exact dates are provided in a format that can be directly compared (YYYY-MM-DD), we can calculate the difference in days.

2. Filter by 'Admission Type': We need to identify respondents with 'Admission Type' = 'Emergency', which corresponds to option 'B' in the schema.

Let's calculate and filter:

- Respondent 110: Admission Type = 'a' (Elective), so this respondent does not meet the 'Emergency' criteria.
- Respondent 143: Admission Type = 'b' (Emergency). Date of Admission = 2022-12-10, Discharge Date = 2022-09-27. Since the discharge date is before the admission date, this calculation would result in a negative number, indicating an error in the provided dates. Thus, we cannot accurately calculate the length of stay for this respondent.
- Respondent 127: Admission Type = 'b' (Emergency). Date of Admission = 2020-08-21, Discharge Date = 2020-10-08. Length of stay = 2020-10-08 - 2020-08-21 = 48 days, which is not between 10 and 15 days.
- Respondent 13: Admission Type = 'b' (Emergency). Date of Admission = 2020-05-31, Discharge Date = 2020-06-19. Length of stay = 2020-06-19 - 2020-05-31 = 19 days, which is not between 10 and 15 days.
- Respondent 89: Admission Type = 'b' (Emergency). Date of Admission = 2022-10-18, Discharge Date = 2022-11-11. Length of stay = 2022-11-11 - 2022-10-18 = 24 days, which is not between 10 and 15 days.
- Respondent 98: Admission Type = 'a' (Elective), so this respondent does not meet the 'Emergency' criteria.
- Respondent 135: Admission Type = 'a' (Elective), so this respondent does not meet the 'Emergency' criteria.

Given the provided data and the errors or mismatches in dates for some respondents, none of the respondents meet both criteria of having an 'Admission Type' of 'Emergency' and a calculated length of stay between 10 and 15 days, primarily due to either not being emergencies or having lengths of stay outside the specified range.

The final answer is: 0",

<task>
Count the respondents whose calculated length of stay is between 5 and 20 days and who have 'Medication' = 'Lipitor'.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the length of stay for each respondent and then filter those whose length of stay is between 5 and 20 days and who have 'Medication' = 'Lipitor'.

1. Calculate the length of stay: This can be done by subtracting the 'Date of Admission' from the 'Discharge Date' for each respondent. However, since the dates are in a string format and not a standard format that can be directly subtracted, we would typically convert these strings into a date format that can be used for calculations. For the purpose of this explanation, let's assume we've done this conversion.

2. Filter respondents based on the length of stay and medication:
   - Length of stay between 5 and 20 days.
   - 'Medication' = 'Lipitor'. According to the schema, 'Lipitor' corresponds to option 'C'.

Let's examine the responses:

- Respondent 107: 
  - Length of stay: From 2024-01-31 to 2024-02-02, which is 2 days.
  - Medication: 'a', which corresponds to 'Aspirin'.

- Respondent 105: 
  - Length of stay: From 2023-05-18 to 2023-06-03, which is 16 days.
  - Medication: 'b', which corresponds to 'Ibuprofen'.

- Respondent 39: 
  - Length of stay: From 2021-10-08 to 2021-10-05, which is -3 days (this is likely an error in the data since discharge date is before admission date).
  - Medication: 'e', which corresponds to 'Penicillin'.

- Respondent 77: 
  - Length of stay: From 2024-04-05 to 2024-02-10, which is -55 days (this is likely an error in the data since discharge date is before admission date).
  - Medication: 'b', which corresponds to 'Ibuprofen'.

- Respondent 97: 
  - Length of stay: From 2020-07-01 to 2020-03-05, which is -148 days (this is likely an error in the data since discharge date is before admission date).
  - Medication: 'd', which corresponds to 'Paracetamol'.

- Respondent 48: 
  - Length of stay: From 2021-05-14 to 2021-07-01, which is 18 days.
  - Medication: 'e', which corresponds to 'Penicillin'.

- Respondent 138: 
  - Length of stay: From 2023-07-24 to 2023-09-05, which is 43 days.
  - Medication: 'd', which corresponds to 'Paracetamol'.

- Respondent 122: 
  - Length of stay: From 2021-12-26 to 2022-05-20, which is 145 days.
  - Medication: 'c', which corresponds to 'Lipitor'. However, the length of stay is not between 5 and 20 days.

- Respondent 62: 
  - Length of stay: From 2024-02-22 to 2024-02-04, which is -18 days (this is likely an error in the data since discharge date is before admission date).
  - Medication: 'b', which corresponds to 'Ibuprofen'.

- Respondent 58: 
  - Length of stay: From 2020-05-22 to 2020-06-08, which is 17 days.
  - Medication: 'a', which corresponds to 'Aspirin'.

Given the errors in the data (discharge dates before admission dates), it's challenging to accurately calculate the length of stay for some respondents. However, based on the provided data and ignoring the likely errors:

- Only Respondent 105 and Respondent 58 have lengths of stay that could potentially fall within the 5 to 20 days range without considering the medication yet. Respondent 48 also has 18 days, which falls within the range.

- Among these, none have 'Medication' = 'Lipitor' except for none directly match the criteria given the errors and the specific medication requirement.

Therefore, based on the strict criteria provided and considering the potential errors in the data, the count of respondents whose calculated length of stay is between 5 and 20 days and who have 'Medication' = 'Lipitor' is 0, since none of the respondents meet both conditions accurately based on the information given.",

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents with 'Admission Type' = 'Emergency' and 'Medication' = 'Paracetamol' who have a 'Age' greater 70.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to follow the instructions carefully and analyze the data provided.

First, let's identify the relevant fields and their corresponding values in the 'questions' section:
- 'Admission Type' is a MCQ field with options A. Elective, B. Emergency, C. Urgent.
- 'Medication' is a MCQ field with options A. Aspirin, B. Ibuprofen, C. Lipitor, D. Paracetamol, E. Penicillin.
- 'Age' is an open-ended field.

We are looking for respondents who have:
1. 'Admission Type' = 'Emergency', which corresponds to option B.
2. 'Medication' = 'Paracetamol', which corresponds to option D.
3. 'Age' greater than 70.

Let's examine the 'responses' section:

- Respondent 97: Age = 50, Admission Type = a (Elective), Medication = d (Paracetamol). Does not match.
- Respondent 11: Age = 76, Admission Type = b (Emergency), Medication = b (Ibuprofen). Does not match because Medication is not Paracetamol.
- Respondent 19: Age = 55, Admission Type = b (Emergency), Medication = d (Paracetamol). Does not match because Age is not greater than 70.
- Respondent 49: Age = 72, Admission Type = a (Elective), Medication = a (Aspirin). Does not match.
- Respondent 144: Age = 44, Admission Type = c (Urgent), Medication = e (Penicillin). Does not match.
- Respondent 56: Age = 73, Admission Type = c (Urgent), Medication = a (Aspirin). Does not match.
- Respondent 123: Age = 30, Admission Type = c (Urgent), Medication = e (Penicillin). Does not match.
- Respondent 54: Age = 83, Admission Type = c (Urgent), Medication = a (Aspirin). Does not match.
- Respondent 86: Age = 80, Admission Type = a (Elective), Medication = b (Ibuprofen). Does not match.

None of the respondents match all the criteria specified (Admission Type = Emergency, Medication = Paracetamol, and Age > 70).

The final answer is: 0",

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents with 'Test Results' = 'Abnormal' and 'Admission Type' = 'Urgent' who have a 'Age' less 50.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to follow the instructions carefully and analyze the data provided.

First, let's identify the relevant fields and their corresponding values in the 'questions' section:
- 'Test Results' is a MCQ field with options A. Abnormal, B. Inconclusive, C. Normal.
- 'Admission Type' is a MCQ field with options A. Elective, B. Emergency, C. Urgent.
- 'Age' is an open-ended field.

We are looking for respondents with 'Test Results' = 'Abnormal' (which corresponds to option A), 'Admission Type' = 'Urgent' (which corresponds to option C), and 'Age' less than 50.

Let's examine the 'responses' section:

- Respondent 26: 'Test Results' = a (Abnormal), 'Admission Type' = a (Elective), Age = 48. Does not match 'Admission Type' = 'Urgent'.
- Respondent 121: 'Test Results' = c (Normal), 'Admission Type' = b (Emergency), Age = 76. Does not match 'Test Results' = 'Abnormal' or 'Admission Type' = 'Urgent' or Age < 50.
- Respondent 82: 'Test Results' = a (Abnormal), 'Admission Type' = a (Elective), Age = 82. Does not match 'Admission Type' = 'Urgent' or Age < 50.
- Respondent 53: 'Test Results' = c (Normal), 'Admission Type' = c (Urgent), Age = 38. Does not match 'Test Results' = 'Abnormal'.
- Respondent 95: 'Test Results' = a (Abnormal), 'Admission Type' = a (Elective), Age = 75. Does not match 'Admission Type' = 'Urgent' or Age < 50.
- Respondent 81: 'Test Results' = a (Abnormal), 'Admission Type' = b (Emergency), Age = 42. Does not match 'Admission Type' = 'Urgent'.
- Respondent 106: 'Test Results' = b (Inconclusive), 'Admission Type' = a (Elective), Age = 19. Does not match 'Test Results' = 'Abnormal' or 'Admission Type' = 'Urgent'.
- Respondent 12: 'Test Results' = b (Inconclusive), 'Admission Type' = b (Emergency), Age = 20. Does not match 'Test Results' = 'Abnormal' or 'Admission Type' = 'Urgent'.
- Respondent 145: 'Test Results' = a (Abnormal), 'Admission Type' = c (Urgent), Age = 68. Does not match Age < 50.
- Respondent 57: 'Test Results' = b (Inconclusive), 'Admission Type' = a (Elective), Age = 21. Does not match 'Test Results' = 'Abnormal' or 'Admission Type' = 'Urgent'.
- Respondent 38: 'Test Results' = b (Inconclusive), 'Admission Type' = c (Urgent), Age = 38. Does not match 'Test Results' = 'Abnormal'.
- Respondent 5: 'Test Results' = a (Abnormal), 'Admission Type' = b (Emergency), Age = 54. Does not match 'Admission Type' = 'Urgent'.

After carefully examining all respondents, none match all the criteria of 'Test Results' = 'Abnormal', 'Admission Type' = 'Urgent', and 'Age' less than 50.

The final answer is: 0",

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents with a 'Age' that is higher than the average 'Age' for their 'Medical Condition'.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average age for each medical condition, and then count the respondents whose age is higher than the average age for their respective medical condition.

Based on the provided data:

1. Calculate the average age for each medical condition:
   - Arthritis (A): No respondents.
   - Asthma (B): Respondents 142 (37), 150 (70), 40 (37), 51 (49). Average = (37 + 70 + 37 + 49) / 4 = 193 / 4 = 48.25.
   - Cancer (C): Respondent 85 (67). Average = 67.
   - Diabetes (D): Respondent 107 (77). Average = 77.
   - Hypertension (E): Respondent 76 (70). Average = 70.
   - Obesity (F): Respondents 149 (63), 59 (52). Average = (63 + 52) / 2 = 115 / 2 = 57.5.

2. Identify respondents with an age higher than the average for their medical condition:
   - Asthma (B): Respondent 150 (70) is higher than 48.25.
   - Cancer (C): None, as there's only one respondent.
   - Diabetes (D): None, as there's only one respondent.
   - Hypertension (E): None, as there's only one respondent.
   - Obesity (F): Respondent 149 (63) is higher than 57.5.

Counting these respondents:
- Respondent 150 for Asthma.
- Respondent 149 for Obesity.

Therefore, the number of respondents with an age higher than the average age for their medical condition is 2.",

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who are in a 'Hospital' where the number of individuals with 'Medical Condition = 'Cancer'' is greater than the number with 'Medical Condition = 'Asthma''.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to identify the respondents with 'Medical Condition' = 'Cancer' and 'Medical Condition' = 'Asthma' for each hospital, and then compare these counts.

From the responses:

- Respondent 63: Hospital = HOSP_63, Medical Condition = c (Cancer)
- Respondent 44: Hospital = HOSP_44, Medical Condition = c (Cancer)
- Respondent 141: Hospital = HOSP_141, Medical Condition = b (Asthma)
- Respondent 66: Hospital = HOSP_66, Medical Condition = b (Asthma)
- Respondent 91: Hospital = HOSP_91, Medical Condition = b (Asthma)
- Respondent 126: Hospital = HOSP_126, Medical Condition = a (Arthritis), not relevant to the comparison.
- Respondent 36: Hospital = HOSP_36, Medical Condition = a (Arthritis), not relevant to the comparison.
- Other respondents do not have 'Cancer' or 'Asthma'.

Now, let's count the 'Cancer' and 'Asthma' cases by hospital:
- HOSP_63: 1 Cancer, 0 Asthma
- HOSP_44: 1 Cancer, 0 Asthma
- HOSP_141: 0 Cancer, 1 Asthma
- HOSP_66: 0 Cancer, 1 Asthma
- HOSP_91: 0 Cancer, 1 Asthma
- HOSP_126 and HOSP_36 are not relevant as they do not contribute to the 'Cancer' vs. 'Asthma' comparison.

Since the task asks for hospitals where the number of 'Cancer' cases is greater than 'Asthma' cases, we identify:
- HOSP_63
- HOSP_44

These are the hospitals where 'Cancer' cases outnumber 'Asthma' cases. Now, we need to count the respondents in these hospitals:
- Respondent 63 (HOSP_63)
- Respondent 44 (HOSP_44)

Therefore, the count of respondents in hospitals where 'Cancer' cases are more than 'Asthma' cases is 2.",
case_43,respondent_count,Count the respondents with a 'Billing Amount' that is higher than the average 'Billing Amount' for their 'Insurance Provider'.,"Survey Data

<task>
Count the respondents with a 'Billing Amount' that is higher than the average 'Billing Amount' for their 'Insurance Provider'.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Billing Amount' for each 'Insurance Provider', and then count the respondents with a 'Billing Amount' higher than this average for their respective 'Insurance Provider'.

From the 'questions' section, we know the 'Insurance Provider' options are:
- A. Aetna
- B. Blue Cross
- C. Cigna
- D. Medicare
- E. UnitedHealthcare

And the 'responses' section provides the 'Billing Amount' and 'Insurance Provider' for each respondent.

Let's calculate the average 'Billing Amount' for each 'Insurance Provider':

1. **Aetna (A)**: No respondents.
2. **Blue Cross (B)**: Respondents 139, 135, 36, 60, and 18.
   - Billing Amounts: 18843, 27360, 24500, 37735, 12263.
   - Average = (18843 + 27360 + 24500 + 37735 + 12263) / 5 = 124420 / 5 = 24884.
3. **Cigna (C)**: Respondents 48, 16, 13, and 2.
   - Billing Amounts: 35777, 36992, 23685, 31516.
   - Average = (35777 + 36992 + 23685 + 31516) / 4 = 127970 / 4 = 31992.5.
4. **Medicare (D)**: Respondent 20.
   - Billing Amount: -503.
   - Average = -503 (since there's only one respondent).
5. **UnitedHealthcare (E)**: Respondents 9, 106, and 60.
   - Billing Amounts: 6176, 47909, 37735.
   - Average = (6176 + 47909 + 37735) / 3 = 91820 / 3 = 30606.67.

Now, let's identify respondents with a 'Billing Amount' higher than the average for their 'Insurance Provider':

1. **Blue Cross (B)**: Average is 24884.
   - Respondent 139: 18843 (no)
   - Respondent 135: 27360 (yes)
   - Respondent 36: 24500 (no)
   - Respondent 60: 37735 (yes)
   - Respondent 18: 12263 (no)
2. **Cigna (C)**: Average is 31992.5.
   - Respondent 48: 35777 (yes)
   - Respondent 16: 36992 (yes)
   - Respondent 13: 23685 (no)
   - Respondent 2: 31516 (no)
3. **Medicare (D)**: Average is -503.
   - Respondent 20: -503 (no, since it's equal and not higher)
4. **UnitedHealthcare (E)**: Average is 30606.67.
   - Respondent 9: 6176 (no)
   - Respondent 106: 47909 (yes)
   - Respondent 60: Already counted under Blue Cross.

Counting the respondents with a 'Billing Amount' higher than the average for their 'Insurance Provider':
- Under Blue Cross: 2 (Respondents 135 and 60)
- Under Cigna: 2 (Respondents 48 and 16)
- Under UnitedHealthcare: 1 (Respondent 106)

Total count: 2 (Blue Cross) + 2 (Cigna) + 1 (UnitedHealthcare) = 5

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$",

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents with 'Insurance Provider = 'Blue Cross'' who have a 'Age' that is lower than the overall average for all respondents.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the overall average age of all respondents. Then, we identify the respondents with 'Insurance Provider' as 'Blue Cross' and check if their age is lower than the calculated average age.

1. **Calculate the overall average age:**

Respondent 3: Age = 34
Respondent 56: Age = 73
Respondent 130: Age = 30
Respondent 117: Age = 58
Respondent 96: Age = 18
Respondent 16: Age = 82
Respondent 124: Age = 57

Total age = 34 + 73 + 30 + 58 + 18 + 82 + 57 = 352

Number of respondents = 7

Average age = Total age / Number of respondents = 352 / 7 = 50.29 (rounded to two decimal places)

2. **Identify respondents with 'Insurance Provider' as 'Blue Cross':**

From the 'questions' section, 'Insurance Provider' is a MCQ with options:
A. Aetna
B. Blue Cross
C. Cigna
D. Medicare
E. UnitedHealthcare

We look for respondents with 'Insurance Provider' = 'B' (since B corresponds to Blue Cross).

Respondent 96: Insurance Provider = b (which corresponds to Blue Cross)

3. **Check if the age of these respondents is lower than the overall average age:**

Respondent 96: Age = 18, which is lower than 50.29.

However, we must also check if there are any other respondents with 'Insurance Provider' as 'Blue Cross' that we might have missed:

Upon reviewing the data again, we see that Respondent 56 does not have 'Blue Cross' as their insurance provider (they have 'd', which corresponds to Medicare), and neither do the other respondents except for Respondent 96.

But, we missed checking the actual count of respondents that match both conditions correctly because we only identified one respondent (Respondent 96) with 'Blue Cross' and did not thoroughly check the rest for the 'Blue Cross' condition correctly in the step-by-step process.

Let's correct that oversight:

- Respondent 3: Insurance Provider = c (Cigna), Age = 34
- Respondent 56: Insurance Provider = d (Medicare), Age = 73
- Respondent 130: Insurance Provider = d (Medicare), Age = 30
- Respondent 117: Insurance Provider = e (UnitedHealthcare), Age = 58
- Respondent 96: Insurance Provider = b (Blue Cross), Age = 18
- Respondent 16: Insurance Provider = c (Cigna), Age = 82
- Respondent 124: Insurance Provider = c (Cigna), Age = 57

Only Respondent 96 has 'Blue Cross' as their insurance provider, and their age (18) is indeed lower than the average age (50.29).

Therefore, the count of respondents with 'Insurance Provider' = 'Blue Cross' who have an 'Age' lower than the overall average age is 1.",

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents with a 'Age' that is higher than the average 'Age' for their 'Hospital'.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average age for each hospital and then compare each respondent's age to the average age of their respective hospital.

From the provided data:

1. Respondent 5: Age 54, Hospital HOSP_05
2. Respondent 2: Age 38, Hospital HOSP_02
3. Respondent 137: Age 24, Hospital HOSP_137
4. Respondent 142: Age 37, Hospital HOSP_142
5. Respondent 106: Age 19, Hospital HOSP_106
6. Respondent 4: Age 51, Hospital HOSP_04
7. Respondent 136: Age 22, Hospital HOSP_136
8. Respondent 71: Age 52, Hospital HOSP_71
9. Respondent 138: Age 58, Hospital HOSP_138
10. Respondent 74: Age 83, Hospital HOSP_74
11. Respondent 129: Age 35, Hospital HOSP_129
12. Respondent 111: Age 19, Hospital HOSP_111

Since each respondent is from a different hospital, the average age for each hospital is the age of the respondent from that hospital.

Now, comparing each respondent's age to the ""average"" (which is their own age since they are the only one from their hospital), every respondent's age is equal to the average age of their hospital. However, the task asks for ages higher than the average, which means we are looking for respondents whose age is higher than the average age calculated for their specific hospital group. Given the data, this interpretation leads to a misunderstanding because, technically, no one's age is higher than their own age.

But, considering the intent might be to find those whose age exceeds the mean age if we were to calculate an overall average or compare within groups (though the provided data does not support multiple respondents per hospital), let's clarify:

If we calculate the overall average age across all respondents:
- Total age = 54 + 38 + 24 + 37 + 19 + 51 + 22 + 52 + 58 + 83 + 35 + 19 = 492
- Number of respondents = 12
- Average age = Total age / Number of respondents = 492 / 12 = 41

Now, comparing each respondent's age to this overall average:
- Ages higher than 41: 54, 51, 52, 58, 83

Respondents with ages higher than the overall average age (41) are:
- Respondent 5: Age 54
- Respondent 4: Age 51
- Respondent 71: Age 52
- Respondent 138: Age 58
- Respondent 74: Age 83

Count of respondents with 'Age' higher than the average 'Age' for their 'Hospital' (considering the overall average due to the nature of the provided data): 5",

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents with a 'Billing Amount' that is higher than the average 'Billing Amount' for their 'Hospital'.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Billing Amount' for each 'Hospital', and then count the respondents with a 'Billing Amount' higher than this average for their respective 'Hospital'.

Given the data:

1. Respondent 28: Hospital - HOSP_28, Billing Amount - 5767
2. Respondent 25: Hospital - HOSP_25, Billing Amount - 6313
3. Respondent 135: Hospital - HOSP_135, Billing Amount - 27360
4. Respondent 39: Hospital - HOSP_39, Billing Amount - 45453
5. Respondent 62: Hospital - HOSP_62, Billing Amount - 44437
6. Respondent 50: Hospital - HOSP_50, Billing Amount - 5517
7. Respondent 65: Hospital - HOSP_65, Billing Amount - 29851

Since each respondent is from a different hospital, the average billing amount for each hospital is the billing amount of the respondent from that hospital. 

Now, comparing each respondent's billing amount to the ""average"" (which, in this case, is their own since they are the only ones from their respective hospitals), we see that every respondent's billing amount is equal to the ""average"" for their hospital because there's only one billing amount per hospital. Therefore, no respondent has a billing amount higher than the average for their hospital, as they are all the average.

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the respondents with 'Insurance Provider = 'Blue Cross'' who have a 'Age' that is lower than the overall average for all respondents.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the overall average age of all respondents. Then, we identify the respondents with 'Insurance Provider' as 'Blue Cross' and check which of these have an age lower than the calculated average.

1. **Calculate the overall average age:**

Respondent 69: Age = 18
Respondent 102: Age = 59
Respondent 21: Age = 57
Respondent 96: Age = 18
Respondent 104: Age = 60
Respondent 118: Age = 27
Respondent 145: Age = 68
Respondent 63: Age = 43
Respondent 58: Age = 58
Respondent 77: Age = 59

Total Age = 18 + 59 + 57 + 18 + 60 + 27 + 68 + 43 + 58 + 59 = 467

Number of Respondents = 10

Average Age = Total Age / Number of Respondents = 467 / 10 = 46.7

2. **Identify respondents with 'Insurance Provider' as 'Blue Cross' (B):**

From the schema, 'Insurance Provider' is coded as follows: ""[MCQ: A. Aetna B. Blue Cross C. Cigna D. Medicare E. UnitedHealthcare]"".

Respondents with 'Insurance Provider' = 'Blue Cross' are those with 'B' as their answer.

- Respondent 96 has 'Insurance Provider' = 'b' (which corresponds to 'Blue Cross').

3. **Check which of these respondents have an age lower than the overall average (46.7):**

- Respondent 96: Age = 18, which is lower than 46.7.

Therefore, there is **1** respondent with 'Insurance Provider' = 'Blue Cross' who has an age lower than the overall average age.",

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who are in a 'Hospital' where the number of individuals with 'Medical Condition = 'Diabetes'' is greater than the number with 'Medical Condition = 'Hypertension''.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to identify the respondents with 'Medical Condition' = 'Diabetes' and 'Medical Condition' = 'Hypertension' for each hospital, and then compare these counts.

From the 'questions' section, we know:
- 'Medical Condition' is a MCQ with options A. Arthritis, B. Asthma, C. Cancer, D. Diabetes, E. Hypertension, F. Obesity.
- 'Hospital' is an open-ended field.

Let's analyze the 'responses' section:

1. Respondent 9: Hospital = HOSP_09, Medical Condition = e (Hypertension)
2. Respondent 24: Hospital = HOSP_24, Medical Condition = d (Diabetes)
3. Respondent 104: Hospital = HOSP_104, Medical Condition = f (Obesity)
4. Respondent 98: Hospital = HOSP_98, Medical Condition = b (Asthma)
5. Respondent 97: Hospital = HOSP_97, Medical Condition = e (Hypertension)
6. Respondent 142: Hospital = HOSP_142, Medical Condition = b (Asthma)

Now, let's count the number of individuals with 'Medical Condition' = 'Diabetes' and 'Medical Condition' = 'Hypertension' for each hospital:

- HOSP_09: 0 (Diabetes), 1 (Hypertension)
- HOSP_24: 1 (Diabetes), 0 (Hypertension)
- HOSP_104: 0 (Diabetes), 0 (Hypertension)
- HOSP_98: 0 (Diabetes), 0 (Hypertension)
- HOSP_97: 0 (Diabetes), 1 (Hypertension)
- HOSP_142: 0 (Diabetes), 0 (Hypertension)

The only hospital where the number of individuals with 'Medical Condition' = 'Diabetes' is greater than the number with 'Medical Condition' = 'Hypertension' is HOSP_24.

Counting the respondents in HOSP_24:
- Respondent 24

Therefore, the number of respondents who are in a 'Hospital' where the number of individuals with 'Medical Condition' = 'Diabetes' is greater than the number with 'Medical Condition' = 'Hypertension' is 1.",

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents with a 'Age' that is higher than the average 'Age' for their 'Hospital'.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average age for each hospital and then compare each respondent's age to the average age of their respective hospital.

From the provided data:

1. Respondent 15: Age 69, Hospital HOSP_15
2. Respondent 3: Age 34, Hospital HOSP_03
3. Respondent 44: Age 54, Hospital HOSP_44
4. Respondent 22: Age 57, Hospital HOSP_22
5. Respondent 128: Age 28, Hospital HOSP_128
6. Respondent 112: Age 67, Hospital HOSP_112
7. Respondent 85: Age 67, Hospital HOSP_85
8. Respondent 145: Age 68, Hospital HOSP_145
9. Respondent 25: Age 63, Hospital HOSP_25
10. Respondent 136: Age 22, Hospital HOSP_136
11. Respondent 11: Age 76, Hospital HOSP_11
12. Respondent 59: Age 52, Hospital HOSP_59

Since each respondent is associated with a unique hospital, and there's only one respondent per hospital, the average age for each hospital is the age of its single respondent.

Now, comparing each respondent's age to the ""average"" (which is their own age since they are the only one in their hospital), no one will be higher than their own age. However, this interpretation seems to misunderstand the task due to the nature of the data provided. 

Given the data structure, it seems the task implies a comparison that isn't directly applicable since each hospital only has one respondent. Thus, under normal circumstances, you would calculate the average age per hospital and then count those above it. But here, every respondent is their hospital's average age, making the comparison as requested not applicable in the conventional sense.

However, following the task's instruction to the letter as requested, and considering the peculiar nature of this dataset where each hospital has only one respondent, the answer would technically be ""0"" because no respondent has an age higher than the average age of their hospital, as they are the average themselves. 

The final answer is: 0",

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents with a 'Billing Amount' that is higher than the average 'Billing Amount' for their 'Medical Condition'.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Billing Amount' for each 'Medical Condition', and then count the respondents with a 'Billing Amount' higher than the average for their respective 'Medical Condition'.

Based on the provided data:

1. Respondent 146: Medical Condition - d (Diabetes), Billing Amount - 1590
2. Respondent 122: Medical Condition - d (Diabetes), Billing Amount - 48996
3. Respondent 70: Medical Condition - d (Diabetes), Billing Amount - 32643
4. Respondent 12: Medical Condition - d (Diabetes), Billing Amount - 45820
5. Respondent 20: Medical Condition - b (Asthma), Billing Amount - -503
6. Respondent 72: Medical Condition - e (Hypertension), Billing Amount - 30437
7. Respondent 140: Medical Condition - c (Cancer), Billing Amount - 25426
8. Respondent 145: Medical Condition - e (Hypertension), Billing Amount - 46430

Calculating the average 'Billing Amount' for each 'Medical Condition':

- For Diabetes (d): (1590 + 48996 + 32643 + 45820) / 4 = 33912.25
- For Asthma (b): -503 (only one respondent)
- For Cancer (c): 25426 (only one respondent)
- For Hypertension (e): (30437 + 46430) / 2 = 38433.5

Now, comparing each respondent's 'Billing Amount' to the average for their 'Medical Condition':

- Respondent 146 (Diabetes): 1590 < 33912.25
- Respondent 122 (Diabetes): 48996 > 33912.25
- Respondent 70 (Diabetes): 32643 < 33912.25
- Respondent 12 (Diabetes): 45820 > 33912.25
- Respondent 20 (Asthma): Since there's only one respondent with Asthma, we cannot compare to an average, so this respondent is not counted in this context.
- Respondent 72 (Hypertension): 30437 < 38433.5
- Respondent 140 (Cancer): Since there's only one respondent with Cancer, we cannot compare to an average, so this respondent is not counted in this context.
- Respondent 145 (Hypertension): 46430 > 38433.5

Counting the respondents with a 'Billing Amount' higher than the average for their 'Medical Condition':

1. Respondent 122
2. Respondent 12
3. Respondent 145

Therefore, the number of respondents with a 'Billing Amount' higher than the average 'Billing Amount' for their 'Medical Condition' is 3.",
