<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose Billing Amount is greater than 10000.
</task>","To determine the count of respondents whose Billing Amount is greater than 10000, we need to examine each respondent's Billing Amount in the 'responses' section.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
How many respondents have a Medication of 'Penicillin'?
</task>","To determine the number of respondents who have a Medication of 'Penicillin', we need to refer to the 'questions' section to understand the medication options. According to the schema, the medication options are ""[MCQ: A. Aspirin B. Ibuprofen C. Lipitor D. Paracetamol E. Penicillin]"". This means 'Penicillin' corresponds to option 'E'.

Next, we examine the 'responses' section to find respondents who selected 'E' for their Medication. 

Respondent 38: Medication - d (Paracetamol)
Respondent 63: Medication - b (Ibuprofen)
Respondent 136: Medication - b (Ibuprofen)
Respondent 106: Medication - c (Lipitor)
Respondent 145: Medication - e (Penicillin)
Respondent 47: Medication - b (Ibuprofen)
Respondent 44: Medication - e (Penicillin)
Respondent 45: Medication - a (Aspirin)
Respondent 21: Medication - e (Penicillin)
Respondent 98: Medication - b (Ibuprofen)
Respondent 62: Medication - b (Ibuprofen)

From the responses, the following respondents have 'Penicillin' as their medication: Respondent 145, Respondent 44, Respondent 21.

Therefore, the number of respondents with a Medication of 'Penicillin' is 3.",

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
How many respondents have a Medication of 'Aspirin'?
</task>","To determine the number of respondents who have a Medication of 'Aspirin', we need to look at the 'Medication' field in the 'responses' section and map the letter codes to the corresponding option text from the 'Medication' schema in the 'questions' section.

The 'Medication' schema is: 
""[MCQ: A. Aspirin B. Ibuprofen C. Lipitor D. Paracetamol E. Penicillin]"".

We then search for respondents with 'Medication' set to 'a' (since 'a' corresponds to 'Aspirin').

Respondent 107 has Medication: a
Respondent 139 has Medication: a

There are 2 respondents with Medication 'Aspirin' (Respondent 107 and Respondent 139) but also Respondent 52 and Respondent 136 and Respondent 149 and Respondent 24 and Respondent 84 and Respondent 45 have medication that could potentially be 'Aspirin' if their codes match 'a'. 

Upon reviewing the data:
- Respondent 107: a
- Respondent 139: a
- Respondent 52: d
- Respondent 136: b
- Respondent 149: b
- Respondent 24: c
- Respondent 84: b
- Respondent 45: a
- Respondent 9: c
- Respondent 34: d
- Respondent 94: e
- Respondent 76: d

Only the respondents with 'a' as their medication code should be counted.

Thus, the total number of respondents with 'Aspirin' as their medication is 3 (Respondent 107, Respondent 139, and Respondent 45).

The final answer is: 3",

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose Age is greater than 60.
</task>","To determine the count of respondents whose Age is greater than 60, we need to examine the 'Age' field in each respondent's data.

From the provided responses:
- Respondent 102: Age = 59 (less than 60)
- Respondent 143: Age = 80 (greater than 60)
- Respondent 94: Age = 81 (greater than 60)
- Respondent 24: Age = 31 (less than 60)
- Respondent 4: Age = 51 (less than 60)
- Respondent 68: Age = 26 (less than 60)
- Respondent 138: Age = 58 (less than 60)
- Respondent 32: Age = 28 (less than 60)

Therefore, the respondents with an Age greater than 60 are Respondent 143 and Respondent 94.

The final answer is: 2",

- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents have Gender = 'Female' and Admission Type = 'Emergency'?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to examine each respondent's data for Gender and Admission Type.

From the 'questions' section, we know:
- Gender is an MCQ with A. Female and B. Male.
- Admission Type is an MCQ with A. Elective, B. Emergency, and C. Urgent.

We are looking for respondents who are Female (A) and have an Admission Type of Emergency (B).

Let's analyze the responses:

1. Respondent 126: Gender = b (Male), Admission Type = b (Emergency) - Does not match.
2. Respondent 105: Gender = b (Male), Admission Type = a (Elective) - Does not match.
3. Respondent 72: Gender = a (Female), Admission Type = b (Emergency) - Matches.
4. Respondent 9: Gender = a (Female), Admission Type = b (Emergency) - Matches.
5. Respondent 95: Gender = a (Female), Admission Type = a (Elective) - Does not match.
6. Respondent 56: Gender = b (Male), Admission Type = c (Urgent) - Does not match.

There are 2 respondents who have Gender = 'Female' and Admission Type = 'Emergency'.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents have Gender = 'Male' and Admission Type = 'Elective'?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to identify respondents who have both 'Male' as their gender and 'Elective' as their admission type.

From the 'questions' section, we know:
- Gender is an MCQ with A. Female and B. Male.
- Admission Type is an MCQ with A. Elective, B. Emergency, and C. Urgent.

We will go through each respondent's data to find matches:

1. Respondent 24: Gender = 'a' (Female), Admission Type = 'b' (Emergency) - Not a match.
2. Respondent 55: Gender = 'b' (Male), Admission Type = 'b' (Emergency) - Not a match.
3. Respondent 6: Gender = 'b' (Male), Admission Type = 'a' (Elective) - Match.
4. Respondent 13: Gender = 'b' (Male), Admission Type = 'b' (Emergency) - Not a match.
5. Respondent 86: Gender = 'a' (Female), Admission Type = 'a' (Elective) - Not a match.
6. Respondent 63: Gender = 'b' (Male), Admission Type = 'a' (Elective) - Match.
7. Respondent 33: Gender = 'b' (Male), Admission Type = 'b' (Emergency) - Not a match.
8. Respondent 145: Gender = 'b' (Male), Admission Type = 'c' (Urgent) - Not a match.
9. Respondent 53: Gender = 'b' (Male), Admission Type = 'c' (Urgent) - Not a match.
10. Respondent 18: Gender = 'b' (Male), Admission Type = 'b' (Emergency) - Not a match.
11. Respondent 142: Gender = 'a' (Female), Admission Type = 'a' (Elective) - Not a match.
12. Respondent 54: Gender = 'a' (Female), Admission Type = 'c' (Urgent) - Not a match.

There are 2 respondents who match the criteria: Respondent 6 and Respondent 63.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents have a Blood Type of 'A+'?
</task>","To determine the number of respondents with a Blood Type of 'A+', we need to look at the 'Blood Type' field in the 'responses' section and map the letter codes to the corresponding option text from the 'questions' schema.

The 'questions' schema for Blood Type is: 
""[MCQ: A. A+ B. A- C. AB+ D. AB- E. B+ F. B- G. O+ H. O-]""

We are looking for respondents with Blood Type 'A+', which corresponds to option 'A'.

Looking through the responses:

- Respondent 129: Blood Type 'e' (B+)
- Respondent 57: Blood Type 'h' (O-)
- Respondent 12: Blood Type 'c' (AB+)
- Respondent 134: Blood Type 'd' (AB-)
- Respondent 78: Blood Type 'e' (B+)
- Respondent 118: Blood Type 'd' (AB-)
- Respondent 8: Blood Type 'e' (B+)
- Respondent 16: Blood Type 'a' (A+)
- Respondent 123: Blood Type 'd' (AB-)
- Respondent 103: Blood Type 'c' (AB+)
- Respondent 110: Blood Type 'e' (B+)
- Respondent 28: Blood Type 'c' (AB+)

Only Respondent 16 has a Blood Type of 'A+'.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents have Gender = 'Male' and Insurance Provider = 'Aetna'?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to identify respondents who are male and have Aetna as their insurance provider.

From the 'questions' section, we know:
- Gender is an MCQ with A. Female and B. Male.
- Insurance Provider is an MCQ with A. Aetna, B. Blue Cross, C. Cigna, D. Medicare, E. UnitedHealthcare.

We will look through the responses to find males (Gender = 'b') and those with Aetna as their insurance provider (Insurance Provider = 'a').

Respondent 114: Gender = 'a' (Female), Insurance Provider = 'b' (Blue Cross)
Respondent 19: Gender = 'a' (Female), Insurance Provider = 'c' (Cigna)
Respondent 21: Gender = 'b' (Male), Insurance Provider = 'e' (UnitedHealthcare)
Respondent 83: Gender = 'a' (Female), Insurance Provider = 'e' (UnitedHealthcare)
Respondent 38: Gender = 'b' (Male), Insurance Provider = 'a' (Aetna)
Respondent 17: Gender = 'a' (Female), Insurance Provider = 'd' (Medicare)
Respondent 33: Gender = 'b' (Male), Insurance Provider = 'a' (Aetna)
Respondent 71: Gender = 'b' (Male), Insurance Provider = 'b' (Blue Cross)
Respondent 150: Gender = 'b' (Male), Insurance Provider = 'd' (Medicare)
Respondent 141: Gender = 'a' (Female), Insurance Provider = 'd' (Medicare)
Respondent 84: Gender = 'b' (Male), Insurance Provider = 'c' (Cigna)
Respondent 98: Gender = 'a' (Female), Insurance Provider = 'e' (UnitedHealthcare)

Only Respondent 38 and Respondent 33 match the criteria of being male and having Aetna as their insurance provider.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents with Gender = 'Female' and Admission Type = 'Emergency' have a Billing Amount below 30000?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to analyze the 'responses' section based on the 'questions' schema.

1. Identify respondents with Gender = 'Female'. According to the schema, Gender is an MCQ with A. Female and B. Male. So, we are looking for respondents with Gender = 'a' (since 'a' corresponds to Female).

2. Identify respondents with Admission Type = 'Emergency'. The schema shows Admission Type as an MCQ with A. Elective, B. Emergency, and C. Urgent. Thus, we are looking for respondents with Admission Type = 'b' (since 'b' corresponds to Emergency).

3. Among those identified in steps 1 and 2, find respondents with a Billing Amount below 30000.

Let's examine the responses:

- Respondent 87: Gender = 'a' (Female), Admission Type = 'a' (Elective), Billing Amount = 19581. Does not match because Admission Type is not 'Emergency'.
- Respondent 117: Gender = 'a' (Female), Admission Type = 'a' (Elective), Billing Amount = 20228. Does not match because Admission Type is not 'Emergency'.
- Respondent 103: Gender = 'b' (Male), so does not match.
- Respondent 107: Gender = 'a' (Female), Admission Type = 'a' (Elective), Billing Amount = 3326. Does not match because Admission Type is not 'Emergency'.
- Respondent 25: Gender = 'a' (Female), Admission Type = 'a' (Elective), Billing Amount = 6313. Does not match because Admission Type is not 'Emergency'.
- Respondent 81: Gender = 'a' (Female), Admission Type = 'b' (Emergency), Billing Amount = 14681. Matches all criteria.
- Respondent 110: Gender = 'b' (Male), so does not match.
- Respondent 66: Gender = 'b' (Male), so does not match.
- Respondent 96: Gender = 'b' (Male), so does not match.
- Respondent 40: Gender = 'a' (Female), Admission Type = 'a' (Elective), Billing Amount = 17696. Does not match because Admission Type is not 'Emergency'.
- Respondent 122: Gender = 'a' (Female), Admission Type = 'b' (Emergency), Billing Amount = 48996. Does not match because Billing Amount is above 30000.

Only Respondent 81 matches all the given criteria.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose length of stay is between 15 and 25 days and who were admitted for an 'Emergency' procedure.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to understand the relevant fields from the 'questions' section and then analyze the 'responses' section accordingly.

1. **Length of Stay**: This can be calculated by subtracting the 'Date of Admission' from the 'Discharge Date'. Since the exact dates are given, we can calculate the difference in days.
2. **Admission Type**: We are interested in respondents who were admitted for an 'Emergency' procedure. According to the schema, 'Emergency' corresponds to option 'B' in the 'Admission Type' question.

Now, let's analyze the responses:

- **Respondent 144**:
  - Date of Admission: 2022-09-22
  - Discharge Date: 2022-11-07
  - Admission Type: c (Urgent, not Emergency)
- **Respondent 85**:
  - Date of Admission: 2022-10-29
  - Discharge Date: 2022-11-20
  - Admission Type: b (Emergency)
  - Length of Stay: 22 days
- **Respondent 32**:
  - Date of Admission: 2024-01-15
  - Discharge Date: 2024-02-24
  - Admission Type: c (Urgent, not Emergency)
- **Respondent 106**:
  - Date of Admission: 2020-11-18
  - Discharge Date: 2021-01-16
  - Admission Type: a (Elective, not Emergency)
- **Respondent 91**:
  - Date of Admission: 2022-07-08
  - Discharge Date: 2022-06-30
  - Admission Type: a (Elective, not Emergency)
  - Note: The discharge date is before the admission date, which seems to be an error in the data. We will exclude this respondent from our calculation due to this inconsistency.

From the given data, only **Respondent 85** meets the criteria of being admitted for an 'Emergency' procedure. The length of stay for Respondent 85 is 22 days, which falls between 15 and 25 days.

Therefore, the count of respondents whose length of stay is between 15 and 25 days and who were admitted for an 'Emergency' procedure is **1**.",

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents with Gender = 'Female' and Admission Type = 'Emergency' have a Billing Amount below 30000?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to analyze the 'responses' section based on the 'questions' schema.

First, we identify the relevant fields:
- Gender: We are looking for 'Female', which corresponds to option 'A' in the schema.
- Admission Type: We are looking for 'Emergency', which corresponds to option 'B' in the schema.
- Billing Amount: We are looking for amounts below 30000.

Now, let's examine each respondent:

1. Respondent 14: Gender = 'a' (Female), Admission Type = 'a' (Elective), Billing Amount = 21186. Meets the billing amount criteria but not the admission type.
2. Respondent 74: Gender = 'b' (Male), so this respondent does not meet the gender criteria.
3. Respondent 80: Gender = 'b' (Male), so this respondent does not meet the gender criteria.
4. Respondent 91: Gender = 'a' (Female), Admission Type = 'a' (Elective), Billing Amount = 26787. Meets the billing amount criteria but not the admission type.
5. Respondent 27: Gender = 'a' (Female), Admission Type = 'b' (Emergency), Billing Amount = 30591. Meets the gender and admission type criteria but not the billing amount criteria.
6. Respondent 148: Gender = 'b' (Male), so this respondent does not meet the gender criteria.
7. Respondent 130: Gender = 'a' (Female), Admission Type = 'a' (Elective), Billing Amount = 34618. Meets the gender criteria but not the admission type or billing amount.
8. Respondent 55: Gender = 'b' (Male), so this respondent does not meet the gender criteria.
9. Respondent 40: Gender = 'a' (Female), Admission Type = 'a' (Elective), Billing Amount = 17696. Meets the gender and billing amount criteria but not the admission type.
10. Respondent 124: Gender = 'b' (Male), so this respondent does not meet the gender criteria.
11. Respondent 58: Gender = 'b' (Male), so this respondent does not meet the gender criteria.

From the given data, there are no respondents who meet all the specified criteria: Gender = 'Female', Admission Type = 'Emergency', and Billing Amount below 30000.

The final answer is: 0",

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose length of stay is between 10 and 20 days and who were admitted for an 'Emergency' procedure.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to understand the relevant fields from the 'questions' section and then analyze the 'responses' section accordingly.

1. **Length of Stay**: This can be calculated by subtracting the 'Date of Admission' from the 'Discharge Date'. However, since the exact dates are given and not the duration of stay, we'll have to compute this for each respondent.
2. **Admission Type**: We are interested in respondents who were admitted for an 'Emergency' procedure. According to the schema, 'Emergency' corresponds to option 'B' in the 'Admission Type' question.

Given the data, let's calculate the length of stay for each respondent and check if their admission type was 'Emergency' (option 'B'):

- Respondent 110: Admission Type = 'a' (Elective), not 'B'.
- Respondent 144: Admission Type = 'c' (Urgent), not 'B'.
- Respondent 143: Admission Type = 'b' (Emergency). Date of Admission = 2022-12-10, Discharge Date = 2022-09-27. This discharge date is before the admission date, which seems incorrect for calculating length of stay. Let's assume there might be a mistake in the data provided.
- Respondent 7: Admission Type = 'b' (Emergency). Date of Admission = 2021-03-05, Discharge Date = 2021-03-05. Length of stay = 0 days.
- Respondent 69: Admission Type = 'b' (Emergency). Date of Admission = 2022-01-09, Discharge Date = 2022-01-12. Length of stay = 3 days.
- Respondent 8: Admission Type = 'a' (Elective), not 'B'.
- Respondent 47: Admission Type = 'c' (Urgent), not 'B'.
- Respondent 70: Admission Type = 'a' (Elective), not 'B'.

From the provided data, only Respondent 69 and potentially Respondent 143 (if the dates were correct) were admitted for an 'Emergency'. However, Respondent 143's dates seem to be incorrect for our calculation, and Respondent 69's length of stay is 3 days, which does not fall between 10 and 20 days.

Given the constraints and the apparent error in Respondent 143's dates, we cannot accurately count any respondents whose length of stay is between 10 and 20 days and who were admitted for an 'Emergency' procedure based on the provided data. 

However, strictly following the task and the data provided without assuming corrections, the answer would be based on the respondents that fit the criteria without any errors in their data.

The final answer is: $\boxed{0}$",

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose length of stay is between 15 and 25 days and who were admitted for an 'Emergency' procedure.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to understand the relevant fields from the 'questions' section and then analyze the 'responses' section accordingly.

1. **Length of Stay**: This can be calculated by subtracting the 'Date of Admission' from the 'Discharge Date'. However, since the exact dates are given and not the duration of stay, we'll have to compute this for each respondent.
2. **Admission Type**: We are interested in respondents who were admitted for an 'Emergency' procedure. According to the schema, 'Emergency' corresponds to option 'B' in the 'Admission Type' question.

Given the data, let's calculate the length of stay for each respondent and check if their admission type was 'Emergency' (B):

- Respondent 87: Admission Type = 'a' (Elective), so this respondent does not meet the 'Emergency' criterion.
- Respondent 90: Admission Type = 'c' (Urgent), so this respondent does not meet the 'Emergency' criterion.
- Respondent 2: Admission Type = 'b' (Emergency). Length of stay calculation is needed.
- Respondent 47: Admission Type = 'c' (Urgent), so this respondent does not meet the 'Emergency' criterion.
- Respondent 37: Admission Type = 'b' (Emergency). Length of stay calculation is needed.
- Respondent 145: Admission Type = 'c' (Urgent), so this respondent does not meet the 'Emergency' criterion.
- Respondent 103: Admission Type = 'b' (Emergency). Length of stay calculation is needed.
- Respondent 18: Admission Type = 'b' (Emergency). Length of stay calculation is needed.
- Respondent 8: Admission Type = 'a' (Elective), so this respondent does not meet the 'Emergency' criterion.

Now, let's calculate the length of stay for the relevant respondents:

- Respondent 2: Admitted on 2021-01-21, Discharged on 2020-08-27. This date range is invalid for calculating a positive length of stay (discharge date is before admission date), so we exclude this respondent.
- Respondent 37: Admitted on 2022-05-12, Discharged on 2022-07-18. Length of stay = 67 days, which is not between 15 and 25 days.
- Respondent 103: Admitted on 2023-10-11, Discharged on 2024-01-19. Length of stay = 100 days, which is not between 15 and 25 days.
- Respondent 18: Admitted on 2019-08-18, Discharged on 2019-11-22. Length of stay = 96 days, which is not between 15 and 25 days.

Upon reviewing the calculations and criteria, it appears there was an oversight in the initial assessment regarding the calculation of the length of stay for each respondent and matching it against the criteria of being between 15 and 25 days and admitted for an 'Emergency'. Given the corrected understanding and calculations:

None of the respondents meet both criteria of having a length of stay between 15 and 25 days and being admitted for an 'Emergency' procedure based on the provided data and calculations.

The final answer is: $\boxed{0}$",

<task>
Count the respondents whose length of stay is between 10 and 20 days and who were admitted for an 'Elective' procedure.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the length of stay for each respondent and then check if it falls between 10 and 20 days. After that, we need to verify if the admission type was 'Elective'. 

1. Calculate the length of stay: This can be done by subtracting the 'Date of Admission' from the 'Discharge Date' for each respondent.

2. Determine the admission type: According to the schema, 'Admission Type' is a MCQ with options A. Elective, B. Emergency, C. Urgent. We need to find respondents with admission type 'A'.

Let's calculate and analyze the data step by step:

- Respondent 136: 
  - Date of Admission: 2023-06-25
  - Discharge Date: 2023-07-05
  - Length of stay: 10 days
  - Admission Type: c (Urgent)
  
- Respondent 56: 
  - Date of Admission: 2020-01-30
  - Discharge Date: 2020-06-01
  - Length of stay: 123 days
  - Admission Type: c (Urgent)
  
- Respondent 97: 
  - Date of Admission: 2020-07-01
  - Discharge Date: 2020-03-05
  - This discharge date is before the admission date, which seems to be an error in the data. We cannot accurately calculate the length of stay for this respondent.
  
- Respondent 108: 
  - Date of Admission: 2020-08-11
  - Discharge Date: 2020-07-20
  - This discharge date is also before the admission date, indicating another error. We cannot calculate the length of stay for this respondent either.
  
- Respondent 117: 
  - Date of Admission: 2021-01-17
  - Discharge Date: 2021-07-31
  - Length of stay: 195 days
  - Admission Type: a (Elective)
  
- Respondent 88: 
  - Date of Admission: 2023-06-08
  - Discharge Date: 2023-07-02
  - Length of stay: 24 days
  - Admission Type: a (Elective)

Given the errors in the data for Respondents 97 and 108, and considering the criteria of a length of stay between 10 and 20 days and an admission type of 'Elective', none of the respondents perfectly match the criteria due to either the length of stay or errors in the data. However, based on the provided and correctly calculable data:

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents with Gender = 'Male' and Admission Type = 'Elective' have a Billing Amount below 30000?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to analyze the 'responses' section based on the 'questions' schema.

1. Identify respondents with Gender = 'Male'. According to the schema, 'Male' corresponds to option B. So, we look for respondents with Gender = 'b' (case-insensitive).

2. Identify respondents with Admission Type = 'Elective'. According to the schema, 'Elective' corresponds to option A. So, we look for respondents with Admission Type = 'a' (case-insensitive).

3. Among those identified in steps 1 and 2, count how many have a Billing Amount below 30000.

Let's analyze the respondents based on these criteria:

- Respondent 95: Gender = 'a' (Female), so this respondent does not meet the gender criterion.
- Respondent 80: Gender = 'b' (Male), Admission Type = 'c' (not Elective), so this respondent does not meet the admission type criterion.
- Respondent 84: Gender = 'b' (Male), Admission Type = 'c' (not Elective), so this respondent does not meet the admission type criterion.
- Respondent 146: Gender = 'a' (Female), so this respondent does not meet the gender criterion.
- Respondent 22: Gender = 'b' (Male), Admission Type = 'c' (not Elective), so this respondent does not meet the admission type criterion.
- Respondent 14: Gender = 'a' (Female), so this respondent does not meet the gender criterion.
- Respondent 40: Gender = 'a' (Female), so this respondent does not meet the gender criterion.

However, upon re-examining the data provided, it appears there might have been an oversight in the initial analysis regarding the specific combination of Gender = 'Male', Admission Type = 'Elective', and Billing Amount below 30000. Let's correct this by directly identifying any respondent that matches all these criteria:

- Respondent 95 does not match because Gender = 'a' (Female).
- Respondent 80 does not match because Admission Type = 'c' (not Elective).
- Respondent 84 does not match because Admission Type = 'c' (not Elective).
- Respondent 146 does not match because Gender = 'a' (Female).
- Respondent 22 does not match because Admission Type = 'c' (not Elective).
- Respondent 14 does not match because Gender = 'a' (Female) and Admission Type = 'a' (Elective), but the gender is not 'Male'.
- Respondent 40 does not match because Gender = 'a' (Female) and Admission Type = 'a' (Elective), but the gender is not 'Male'.

Actually, none of the provided respondents directly match the criteria of being 'Male', having an 'Elective' Admission Type, and a Billing Amount below 30000 based on the detailed criteria. 

Given the detailed criteria and upon a thorough review, it seems the analysis missed considering if any respondent indeed fits all specified conditions correctly. 

The correct approach should involve:
1. Identifying 'Male' respondents.
2. Among them, finding those with 'Elective' admission.
3. Then, checking their billing amounts.

Given the data:
- Only Respondent 95 has Admission Type = 'a' (Elective) but is not 'Male'.
- The rest of the 'Male' respondents (80, 84, 22) do not have Admission Type = 'a' (Elective).

Thus, the correct count based on the provided data and the specified conditions is 0, as none of the 'Male' respondents have an 'Elective' admission type and a billing amount below 30000 simultaneously.

The final answer is: 0",

Count the respondents whose length of stay is between 10 and 30 days and who were admitted for an 'Elective' procedure.

1. **Length of Stay**: This can be calculated by subtracting the 'Date of Admission' from the 'Discharge Date'. Since the dates are given in a format that can be directly compared (YYYY-MM-DD), we can calculate the difference. However, the specific dates are not directly provided in a comparable format in the question, so we'll have to consider them as is.

2. **Admission Type**: This is given as an MCQ with 'A. Elective' being the option we're interested in.

Given the data, let's analyze each respondent:

- **Respondent 13**: 
  - Admission Type: 'b' (which corresponds to 'Emergency', not 'Elective').
  - Date of Admission: 2020-05-31
  - Discharge Date: 2020-06-19
  - Length of Stay: 19 days

- **Respondent 21**:
  - Admission Type: 'b' (which corresponds to 'Emergency', not 'Elective').
  - Date of Admission: 2021-11-13
  - Discharge Date: 2021-08-19 (This discharge date is before the admission date, which seems incorrect. For the purpose of this analysis, we will assume the data might be flawed and exclude this respondent from the count due to inconsistent data.)

- **Respondent 70**:
  - Admission Type: 'a' (which corresponds to 'Elective').
  - Date of Admission: 2019-07-09
  - Discharge Date: 2019-09-01
  - Length of Stay: 54 days (which is outside our target range of 10-30 days).

- **Respondent 114**:
  - Admission Type: 'a' (which corresponds to 'Elective').
  - Date of Admission: 2024-01-04
  - Discharge Date: 2023-11-08 (This discharge date is before the admission date, which seems incorrect. For the purpose of this analysis, we will assume the data might be flawed and exclude this respondent from the count due to inconsistent data.)

- **Respondent 109**:
  - Admission Type: 'a' (which corresponds to 'Elective').
  - Date of Admission: 2022-05-13
  - Discharge Date: 2022-06-10
  - Length of Stay: 28 days

- **Respondent 125**:
  - Admission Type: 'a' (which corresponds to 'Elective').
  - Date of Admission: 2020-03-08
  - Discharge Date: 2020-02-12 (This discharge date is before the admission date, which seems incorrect. For the purpose of this analysis, we will assume the data might be flawed and exclude this respondent from the count due to inconsistent data.)

- **Respondent 107**:
  - Admission Type: 'a' (which corresponds to 'Elective').
  - Date of Admission: 2024-01-31
  - Discharge Date: 2024-02-02
  - Length of Stay: 2 days (which is outside our target range of 10-30 days).

From the given data, only **Respondent 109** meets the criteria of having a length of stay between 10 and 30 days and being admitted for an 'Elective' procedure.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$",

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose length of stay is between 5 and 35 days and who were admitted for an 'Emergency' procedure.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to understand the relevant fields from the 'questions' section and then analyze the 'responses' section accordingly.

1. **Length of Stay**: This can be calculated by subtracting the 'Date of Admission' from the 'Discharge Date'. Since the dates are given in a format that can be directly compared (YYYY-MM-DD), we can calculate the difference in days.
2. **Admission Type**: We are interested in respondents who were admitted for an 'Emergency' procedure. According to the schema, 'Emergency' corresponds to option 'B' in the 'Admission Type' question.

Now, let's analyze the responses:

- Respondent 56: Admitted on 2020-01-30, discharged on 2020-06-01. Length of stay = 123 days (which is outside our range), and Admission Type = 'c' (Urgent).
- Respondent 132: Admitted on 2021-08-02, discharged on 2021-08-13. Length of stay = 11 days (within our range), and Admission Type = 'c' (Urgent).
- Respondent 30: Admitted on 2023-05-24, discharged on 2023-06-15. Length of stay = 22 days (within our range), and Admission Type = 'b' (Emergency).
- Respondent 89: Admitted on 2022-10-18, discharged on 2022-11-11. Length of stay = 24 days (within our range), and Admission Type = 'b' (Emergency).
- Respondent 111: Admitted on 2022-03-12, discharged on 2022-06-24. Length of stay = 104 days (which is outside our range), and Admission Type = 'b' (Emergency).
- Respondent 29: Admitted on 2019-12-02, discharged on 2019-09-06. This respondent was discharged before being admitted, which doesn't make sense in this context, so we'll exclude this respondent from our count.
- Respondent 73: Admitted on 2024-01-05, discharged on 2024-03-26. Length of stay = 80 days (which is outside our range), and Admission Type = 'a' (Elective).
- Respondent 125: Admitted on 2020-03-08, discharged on 2020-02-12. This respondent was also discharged before being admitted, so we'll exclude this respondent.
- Respondent 135: Admitted on 2023-11-12, discharged on 2023-06-01. This respondent was discharged before being admitted as well, so we'll exclude this respondent.

From the given data, only Respondents 30 and 89 meet the criteria of having a length of stay between 5 and 35 days and being admitted for an 'Emergency' procedure.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents with Gender = 'Male' and Admission Type = 'Emergency' have a Billing Amount below 40000?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to analyze the 'responses' section based on the 'questions' schema.

1. Identify respondents with Gender = 'Male'. According to the schema, Gender is an MCQ with ""A. Female B. Male"". So, we are looking for respondents with Gender = 'b' (since 'b' corresponds to 'Male').

2. Identify respondents with Admission Type = 'Emergency'. The schema for Admission Type is ""A. Elective B. Emergency C. Urgent"". So, we are looking for respondents with Admission Type = 'b' (since 'b' corresponds to 'Emergency').

3. Among those identified in steps 1 and 2, count how many have a Billing Amount below 40000.

From the responses:

- Respondent 102: Gender = 'b' (Male), Admission Type = 'b' (Emergency), Billing Amount = 18856. This respondent meets all criteria.
- Respondent 11: Gender = 'b' (Male), Admission Type = 'b' (Emergency), Billing Amount = 43. This respondent meets all criteria.

Therefore, there are 2 respondents with Gender = 'Male' and Admission Type = 'Emergency' who have a Billing Amount below 40000.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose length of stay is between 10 and 40 days and who were admitted for an 'Urgent' procedure.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to understand the relevant fields from the 'questions' section and then analyze the 'responses' section accordingly.

1. **Length of Stay**: This can be calculated by subtracting the 'Date of Admission' from the 'Discharge Date'. However, since the exact dates are given and not the duration of stay, we'll have to compute this for each respondent.
2. **Admission Type**: We are interested in respondents who were admitted for an 'Urgent' procedure. According to the schema, 'Urgent' corresponds to option 'C' in the 'Admission Type' question.

Given the data, let's calculate and identify:

- **Length of Stay** for each respondent and check if it falls between 10 and 40 days.
- **Admission Type** is 'Urgent' (option C).

Let's analyze the responses:

1. **Respondent 20**: Admission Type is 'a' (Elective), so this respondent does not meet the 'Urgent' criteria.
2. **Respondent 81**: Admission Type is 'b' (Emergency), so this respondent does not meet the 'Urgent' criteria.
3. **Respondent 148**: Admission Type is 'c' (Urgent). Date of Admission is 2023-08-17, and Discharge Date is 2023-10-12. The length of stay is 56 days, which does not fall between 10 and 40 days.
4. **Respondent 110**: Admission Type is 'a' (Elective), so this respondent does not meet the 'Urgent' criteria.
5. **Respondent 147**: Admission Type is 'b' (Emergency), so this respondent does not meet the 'Urgent' criteria.
6. **Respondent 104**: Admission Type is 'a' (Elective), so this respondent does not meet the 'Urgent' criteria.
7. **Respondent 107**: Admission Type is 'a' (Elective), so this respondent does not meet the 'Urgent' criteria.
8. **Respondent 75**: Admission Type is 'c' (Urgent). Date of Admission is 2021-02-12, and Discharge Date is 2021-01-26. The discharge date is before the admission date, which is not possible, so there seems to be an error in the data for this respondent.
9. **Respondent 30**: Admission Type is 'b' (Emergency), so this respondent does not meet the 'Urgent' criteria.
10. **Respondent 6**: Admission Type is 'a' (Elective), so this respondent does not meet the 'Urgent' criteria.
11. **Respondent 84**: Admission Type is 'c' (Urgent). Date of Admission is 2020-01-27, and Discharge Date is 2020-05-13. The length of stay is 107 days, which does not fall between 10 and 40 days.
12. **Respondent 44**: Admission Type is 'a' (Elective), so this respondent does not meet the 'Urgent' criteria.

Upon reviewing the provided data, there are no respondents whose length of stay is between 10 and 40 days and who were admitted for an 'Urgent' procedure, primarily because either the admission type was not 'Urgent' or the length of stay did not fall within the specified range for those who were admitted urgently. 

The final answer is: $\boxed{0}$",

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who are in a hospital where the number of patients with Arthritis is greater than the number of patients with Asthma.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to identify the respondents with Arthritis and Asthma, and then determine the hospitals where the number of patients with Arthritis is greater than the number of patients with Asthma.

From the 'questions' section, we know that:
- Medical Condition is a MCQ field with options: A. Arthritis, B. Asthma, C. Cancer, D. Diabetes, E. Hypertension, F. Obesity
- Hospital is an open-ended field.

We will map the letter codes in the 'responses' to the corresponding option text from the 'questions' schema.

Respondents with Arthritis (A. Arthritis):
- Respondent 93: a (Arthritis)
- Respondent 21: a (Arthritis)

Respondents with Asthma (B. Asthma):
- Respondent 23: b (Asthma)
- Respondent 135: b (Asthma)

Now, let's count the number of patients with Arthritis and Asthma in each hospital:
- HOSP_93 (Respondent 93): 1 Arthritis, 0 Asthma
- HOSP_23 (Respondent 23): 0 Arthritis, 1 Asthma
- HOSP_21 (Respondent 21): 1 Arthritis, 0 Asthma
- HOSP_135 (Respondent 135): 0 Arthritis, 1 Asthma

The hospitals where the number of patients with Arthritis is greater than the number of patients with Asthma are:
- HOSP_93
- HOSP_21

The respondents in these hospitals are:
- Respondent 93
- Respondent 21

There are 2 respondents who are in a hospital where the number of patients with Arthritis is greater than the number of patients with Asthma, but since Respondent 21 and Respondent 93 are the only ones with Arthritis and they are in different hospitals, and there are no other patients with Arthritis or Asthma in their respective hospitals, the count of respondents in hospitals where Arthritis > Asthma is indeed based on the presence of these conditions in the respective hospitals.

However, upon reevaluation, considering the specific question asks for a count of respondents in hospitals where the number of patients with Arthritis exceeds the number of patients with Asthma, and given the data provided, the correct approach should focus on the comparison within each hospital. Since we don't have a comprehensive list of all patients in each hospital, just the ones listed, we can only consider the hospitals mentioned. 

Given this, the actual task is to identify hospitals where Arthritis patients outnumber Asthma patients based on the provided responses, and then count the respondents in those hospitals. 

For HOSP_93 and HOSP_21, there's 1 Arthritis patient each and no Asthma patients mentioned, fitting the criteria. For the other hospitals with Asthma patients (HOSP_23 and HOSP_135), there are no Arthritis patients mentioned, so they don't fit.

Thus, focusing strictly on the data given and the specific question, we identify 2 respondents (93 and 21) in hospitals where the condition is met based on the information provided about their medical conditions and hospital assignments.

The final answer is: 2",

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents have a Billing Amount that is higher than the average Billing Amount for their Admission Type?
</task>","To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the average Billing Amount for each Admission Type. Then, we compare each respondent's Billing Amount to the average for their respective Admission Type and count those that are higher.

From the 'questions' section, we know the Admission Types are:
- A. Elective
- B. Emergency
- C. Urgent

And from the 'responses' section, we can extract the necessary data:

1. Respondent 44: Admission Type - a (Elective), Billing Amount - 48407
2. Respondent 20: Admission Type - a (Elective), Billing Amount - -503
3. Respondent 131: Admission Type - a (Elective), Billing Amount - 14238
4. Respondent 30: Admission Type - b (Emergency), Billing Amount - 10301
5. Respondent 136: Admission Type - c (Urgent), Billing Amount - 4398
6. Respondent 50: Admission Type - a (Elective), Billing Amount - 5517
7. Respondent 90: Admission Type - c (Urgent), Billing Amount - 25230
8. Respondent 38: Admission Type - c (Urgent), Billing Amount - 8409
9. Respondent 61: Admission Type - a (Elective), Billing Amount - 23500
10. Respondent 27: Admission Type - b (Emergency), Billing Amount - 30591

Let's calculate the average Billing Amount for each Admission Type:

- Elective (A): (48407 + (-503) + 14238 + 5517 + 23500) / 5 = (48407 - 503 + 14238 + 5517 + 23500) / 5 = 86159 / 5 = 17231.8
- Emergency (B): (10301 + 30591) / 2 = 40892 / 2 = 20446
- Urgent (C): (4398 + 25230 + 8409) / 3 = (4398 + 25230 + 8409) / 3 = 39037 / 3 = 13012.33

Now, let's compare each respondent's Billing Amount to the average for their Admission Type:

1. Respondent 44 (Elective): 48407 > 17231.8, Yes
2. Respondent 20 (Elective): -503 < 17231.8, No
3. Respondent 131 (Elective): 14238 < 17231.8, No
4. Respondent 30 (Emergency): 10301 < 20446, No
5. Respondent 136 (Urgent): 4398 < 13012.33, No
6. Respondent 50 (Elective): 5517 < 17231.8, No
7. Respondent 90 (Urgent): 25230 > 13012.33, Yes
8. Respondent 38 (Urgent): 8409 < 13012.33, No
9. Respondent 61 (Elective): 23500 > 17231.8, Yes
10. Respondent 27 (Emergency): 30591 > 20446, Yes

Count of respondents with a Billing Amount higher than the average for their Admission Type: 4

The final answer is: 4",

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the respondents who are in a hospital where the number of patients with Asthma is greater than the number of patients with Arthritis.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to identify the respondents with Asthma and Arthritis, and then determine the hospitals where the number of patients with Asthma is greater than the number of patients with Arthritis.

From the 'questions' section, we know that:
- Medical Condition is a MCQ field with options: A. Arthritis, B. Asthma, C. Cancer, D. Diabetes, E. Hypertension, F. Obesity
- Hospital is an open-ended field.

From the 'responses' section, we can identify the respondents with Asthma (B) and Arthritis (A), and their respective hospitals:

Respondents with Asthma: 
- Respondent 66: Hospital - HOSP_66
- Respondent 51: Hospital - HOSP_51
- Respondent 40: Hospital - HOSP_40
- Respondent 20: Hospital - HOSP_20
- Respondent 127: Hospital - HOSP_127

Respondents with Arthritis: 
- Respondent 46: Hospital - HOSP_46

Now, let's count the number of patients with Asthma and Arthritis in each hospital:

- HOSP_66: 1 Asthma, 0 Arthritis
- HOSP_51: 1 Asthma, 0 Arthritis
- HOSP_40: 1 Asthma, 0 Arthritis
- HOSP_20: 1 Asthma, 0 Arthritis
- HOSP_127: 1 Asthma, 0 Arthritis
- HOSP_46: 0 Asthma, 1 Arthritis

HOSP_45 is not considered because the medical condition is Obesity, not Asthma or Arthritis.

The hospitals where the number of patients with Asthma is greater than the number of patients with Arthritis are:
- HOSP_66
- HOSP_51
- HOSP_40
- HOSP_20
- HOSP_127

The number of respondents in these hospitals is 5. 

Therefore, the answer is: 5",

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents have a Billing Amount that is higher than the average Billing Amount for their Admission Type?
</task>","To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the average Billing Amount for each Admission Type. Then, we compare each respondent's Billing Amount to the average for their respective Admission Type and count those that are higher.

From the 'questions' section, we know that Admission Type is categorized as:
- A. Elective
- B. Emergency
- C. Urgent

And from the 'responses' section, we can extract the necessary data.

### Step 1: Calculate the average Billing Amount for each Admission Type

Let's calculate the sum of Billing Amounts and the count of respondents for each Admission Type:

- **Admission Type A (Elective):**
  - Respondent 113: 19328
  - Respondent 114: 20258
  - Total: 39586, Count: 2
  - Average: 39586 / 2 = 19793

- **Admission Type B (Emergency):**
  - Respondent 149: 33211
  - Respondent 81: 14681
  - Respondent 18: 12263
  - Respondent 121: 50119
  - Total: 110274, Count: 4
  - Average: 110274 / 4 = 27568.5

- **Admission Type C (Urgent):**
  - Respondent 145: 46430
  - Respondent 115: 40693
  - Respondent 83: 25966
  - Respondent 39: 45453
  - Respondent 78: 23068
  - Respondent 71: 31486
  - Total: 213096, Count: 6
  - Average: 213096 / 6 = 35516

### Step 2: Compare each respondent's Billing Amount to the average for their Admission Type

Now, let's compare each respondent's Billing Amount to the calculated averages:

- **Admission Type A (Elective):**
  - Respondent 113 (19328): Lower than average
  - Respondent 114 (20258): Higher than average
  - Count: 1

- **Admission Type B (Emergency):**
  - Respondent 149 (33211): Higher than average
  - Respondent 81 (14681): Lower than average
  - Respondent 18 (12263): Lower than average
  - Respondent 121 (50119): Higher than average
  - Count: 2

- **Admission Type C (Urgent):**
  - Respondent 145 (46430): Higher than average
  - Respondent 115 (40693): Lower than average
  - Respondent 83 (25966): Lower than average
  - Respondent 39 (45453): Higher than average
  - Respondent 78 (23068): Lower than average
  - Respondent 71 (31486): Lower than average
  - Count: 2

### Step 3: Sum the counts from each Admission Type

Total count of respondents with a Billing Amount higher than the average for their Admission Type: 1 (Elective) + 2 (Emergency) + 2 (Urgent) = 5

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$",

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents have a Billing Amount that is higher than the average Billing Amount for their Admission Type?
</task>","To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the average Billing Amount for each Admission Type. Then, we compare each respondent's Billing Amount to the average for their respective Admission Type and count those that are higher.

From the 'questions' section, we know:
- Admission Type is an MCQ with options A. Elective, B. Emergency, C. Urgent.
- Billing Amount is an open-ended field.

Let's analyze the 'responses' section:

1. Respondent 91: Admission Type = a (Elective), Billing Amount = 26787
2. Respondent 130: Admission Type = a (Elective), Billing Amount = 34618
3. Respondent 19: Admission Type = b (Emergency), Billing Amount = 10352
4. Respondent 80: Admission Type = c (Urgent), Billing Amount = 43282
5. Respondent 119: Admission Type = a (Elective), Billing Amount = 6768

First, calculate the average Billing Amount for each Admission Type:
- Elective (A): (26787 + 34618 + 6768) / 3 = 22741
- Emergency (B): 10352 (only one respondent, so this is the average)
- Urgent (C): 43282 (only one respondent, so this is the average)

Now, compare each respondent's Billing Amount to the average for their Admission Type:
- Respondent 91 (Elective): 26787 < 22741, No
- Respondent 130 (Elective): 34618 > 22741, Yes
- Respondent 19 (Emergency): 10352 = 10352, No (since it's not higher)
- Respondent 80 (Urgent): 43282 = 43282, No (since it's not higher)
- Respondent 119 (Elective): 6768 < 22741, No

Count the respondents with a Billing Amount higher than the average for their Admission Type: 1

The final answer is: 1",

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who are in a hospital where the number of patients with Obesity is greater than the number of patients with Arthritis.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to identify the respondents with Obesity and Arthritis, and then determine the hospitals where the number of patients with Obesity is greater than the number of patients with Arthritis.

From the 'questions' section, we know that:
- Medical Condition is a MCQ field with options: A. Arthritis, B. Asthma, C. Cancer, D. Diabetes, E. Hypertension, F. Obesity
- Hospital is an open-ended field.

We will map the letter codes in the 'responses' to the corresponding option text from the 'questions' schema.

Respondents with Arthritis (A):
- Respondent 15: Age: 69, Gender: a, Medical Condition: a, Hospital: HOSP_15
- Respondent 74: Age: 83, Gender: b, Medical Condition: a, Hospital: HOSP_74

Respondents with Obesity (F):
- Respondent 99: Age: 67, Gender: b, Medical Condition: f, Hospital: HOSP_99
- Respondent 119: Age: 23, Gender: a, Medical Condition: f, Hospital: HOSP_119
- Respondent 149: Age: 63, Gender: b, Medical Condition: f, Hospital: HOSP_149

Now, let's count the number of patients with Obesity and Arthritis in each hospital:
- HOSP_15: 1 Arthritis, 0 Obesity
- HOSP_74: 1 Arthritis, 0 Obesity
- HOSP_99: 0 Arthritis, 1 Obesity
- HOSP_119: 0 Arthritis, 1 Obesity
- HOSP_149: 0 Arthritis, 1 Obesity

Hospitals where the number of patients with Obesity is greater than the number of patients with Arthritis:
- HOSP_99
- HOSP_119
- HOSP_149

Respondents in these hospitals:
- Respondent 99
- Respondent 119
- Respondent 149

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents have a Billing Amount that is higher than the average Billing Amount for their Admission Type?
</task>","To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the average Billing Amount for each Admission Type. Then, we compare each respondent's Billing Amount to the average for their respective Admission Type and count those that are higher.

From the 'questions' section, we know that Admission Type is categorized as:
- A. Elective
- B. Emergency
- C. Urgent

And Billing Amount is an open-ended field.

Let's calculate the average Billing Amount for each Admission Type based on the 'responses' section:

1. **Admission Type A (Elective):**
   - Respondent 49: 25302
   - Respondent 129: 30358
   - Respondent 88: 39616
   - Respondent 130: 34618
   - Average = (25302 + 30358 + 39616 + 34618) / 4 = 29973.5

2. **Admission Type B (Emergency):**
   - Respondent 147: 25250
   - Respondent 122: 48996
   - Respondent 27: 30591
   - Average = (25250 + 48996 + 30591) / 3 = 34945.67

3. **Admission Type C (Urgent):**
   - Respondent 83: 25966
   - Respondent 39: 45453
   - Respondent 116: 40015
   - Respondent 22: 5998
   - Average = (25966 + 45453 + 40015 + 5998) / 4 = 29308

Now, let's identify respondents with a Billing Amount higher than the average for their Admission Type:

1. **Admission Type A (Elective):**
   - Average is 29973.5
   - Respondent 49: 25302 (lower)
   - Respondent 129: 30358 (lower)
   - Respondent 88: 39616 (higher)
   - Respondent 130: 34618 (higher)
   - Count: 2

2. **Admission Type B (Emergency):**
   - Average is 34945.67
   - Respondent 147: 25250 (lower)
   - Respondent 122: 48996 (higher)
   - Respondent 27: 30591 (lower)
   - Count: 1

3. **Admission Type C (Urgent):**
   - Average is 29308
   - Respondent 83: 25966 (lower)
   - Respondent 39: 45453 (higher)
   - Respondent 116: 40015 (higher)
   - Respondent 22: 5998 (lower)
   - Count: 2

Total count of respondents with a Billing Amount higher than the average for their Admission Type = 2 (from A) + 1 (from B) + 2 (from C) = 5

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$",

<task>
Count the respondents who are in a hospital where the number of patients with Cancer is greater than the number of patients with Diabetes.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to identify the respondents with Cancer and Diabetes, and then determine the hospitals where the number of patients with Cancer is greater than the number of patients with Diabetes.

From the 'questions' section, we know that:
- Medical Condition is a MCQ field with options: A. Arthritis, B. Asthma, C. Cancer, D. Diabetes, E. Hypertension, F. Obesity

We will map the letter codes in the 'responses' to the corresponding option text.

Respondents with Cancer: 
- Respondent 94 (Medical Condition: c, which corresponds to Cancer)

Respondents with Diabetes: 
- Respondent 64 (Medical Condition: d, which corresponds to Diabetes)

Now, let's identify the hospitals for these respondents:
- Respondent 94 (Cancer) is in hospital HOSP_94
- Respondent 64 (Diabetes) is in hospital HOSP_64

Since there is only one respondent with Cancer (in HOSP_94) and one respondent with Diabetes (in HOSP_64), and they are in different hospitals, we need to check if there are any other respondents with Cancer or Diabetes.

After re-examining the data, we find that there are no other respondents with Cancer or Diabetes.

Therefore, the hospital where the number of patients with Cancer is greater than the number of patients with Diabetes is HOSP_94.

However, the task asks us to count the respondents who are in such a hospital. Since there is only one respondent (Respondent 94) in the hospital HOSP_94 where the number of patients with Cancer (1) is greater than the number of patients with Diabetes (0), the answer is:

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents over the age of 60 have a length of stay that is longer than the average for their specific Admission Type?
</task>","To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the average length of stay for each Admission Type. Then, we'll identify respondents over 60 with a length of stay longer than the average for their Admission Type.

1. **Calculate Length of Stay**: This requires subtracting the Date of Admission from the Discharge Date for each respondent. Since the exact dates are provided, we can calculate the length of stay in days.

2. **Determine Admission Type Averages**: 
   - **Admission Type A (Elective)**: Calculate the average length of stay for respondents with Admission Type A.
   - **Admission Type B (Emergency)**: Calculate the average length of stay for respondents with Admission Type B.
   - **Admission Type C (Urgent)**: Calculate the average length of stay for respondents with Admission Type C.

3. **Identify Respondents Over 60**: Filter respondents who are over 60 years old.

4. **Compare Length of Stay**: For each respondent over 60, compare their length of stay to the average length of stay for their specific Admission Type.

Given the complexity and the need for precise date calculations, let's proceed with the available data:

### Respondents and Their Length of Stay

1. **Respondent 73**: Age 21, Admission Type A, Length of Stay = (2024-03-26) - (2024-01-05) = 81 days
2. **Respondent 100**: Age 42, Admission Type C, Length of Stay = (2023-08-25) - (2023-08-13) = 12 days
3. **Respondent 105**: Age 54, Admission Type A, Length of Stay = (2023-06-03) - (2023-05-18) = 16 days
4. **Respondent 87**: Age 55, Admission Type A, Length of Stay = (2023-01-27) - (2023-04-09) = -43 days (Error in dates, skipping)
5. **Respondent 14**: Age 85, Admission Type A, Length of Stay = (2023-09-11) - (2023-10-03) = -22 days (Error in dates, skipping)
6. **Respondent 86**: Age 80, Admission Type A, Length of Stay = (2021-10-14) - (2021-12-19) = -65 days (Error in dates, skipping)
7. **Respondent 17**: Age 19, Admission Type A, Length of Stay = (2021-08-12) - (2021-07-03) = 40 days
8. **Respondent 85**: Age 67, Admission Type B, Length of Stay = (2022-11-20) - (2022-10-29) = 22 days
9. **Respondent 25**: Age 63, Admission Type A, Length of Stay = (2023-11-07) - (2023-11-05) = 2 days
10. **Respondent 143**: Age 80, Admission Type B, Length of Stay = (2022-09-27) - (2022-12-10) = -104 days (Error in dates, skipping)

### Average Length of Stay by Admission Type

- **Admission Type A (Elective)**: Respondents 73, 105, 17, and 25 are considered. Average = (81 + 16 + 40 + 2) / 4 = 139 / 4 = 34.75 days
- **Admission Type B (Emergency)**: Only Respondent 85 has valid dates. Average = 22 days
- **Admission Type C (Urgent)**: Respondent 100. Average = 12 days

### Respondents Over 60 with Longer Than Average Length of Stay

1. **Respondent 86** is skipped due to date error.
2. **Respondent 14** is skipped due to date error.
3. **Respondent 143** is skipped due to date error.
4. **Respondent 85**: Age 67, Length of Stay = 22 days, which is the average for Admission Type B, so not longer.
5. **Respondent 25**: Age 63, Length of Stay = 2 days, which is less than the average for Admission Type A.
6. **Respondent 86** and **Respondent 14** and **Respondent 143** cannot be considered due to errors in their dates.

Given the errors in date calculations for several respondents and the specific request for respondents over 60 with a length of stay longer than the average for their Admission Type, we find that none of the respondents with valid data meet the criteria of being over 60 and having a longer length of stay than the average for their Admission Type, primarily due to errors in date calculations or not meeting the age criterion.

The final answer is: $\boxed{0}$",

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who are in a hospital where the number of patients with Cancer is greater than the number of patients with Asthma.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to identify the respondents with Cancer and Asthma, and then determine the hospitals where the number of patients with Cancer is greater than the number of patients with Asthma.

From the 'questions' section, we know that:
- Medical Condition is a MCQ field with options: A. Arthritis, B. Asthma, C. Cancer, D. Diabetes, E. Hypertension, F. Obesity.

We will map the letter codes in the 'responses' to the corresponding option text.

Respondents with Cancer (C):
- None of the provided respondents have Cancer (C) as their medical condition.

Respondents with Asthma (B):
- Respondent 150 has Medical Condition: b, which corresponds to Asthma.
- Respondent 90 has Medical Condition: b, which corresponds to Asthma.

Since there are no respondents with Cancer, there are no hospitals where the number of patients with Cancer is greater than the number of patients with Asthma.

The answer is: 0",
