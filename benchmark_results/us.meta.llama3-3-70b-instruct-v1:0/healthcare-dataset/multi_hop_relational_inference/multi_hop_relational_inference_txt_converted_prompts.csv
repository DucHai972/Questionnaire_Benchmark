</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondents are in the same hospital as respondent '73'?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to identify the hospital of respondent '73' and then find other respondents who are in the same hospital.

According to the responses, respondent '73' has the following information:
Hospital: HOSP_73

Now, we need to find other respondents who have the same hospital, 'HOSP_73'. After reviewing the responses, we can see that there is no other respondent with the hospital 'HOSP_73'.

Therefore, the answer is: None",

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Find all respondents with the same insurance provider as respondent '62', excluding the respondent themselves.
</task>","To find all respondents with the same insurance provider as respondent '62', we first need to identify the insurance provider of respondent '62'. According to the responses, respondent '62' has an insurance provider of 'd', which corresponds to 'Medicare' based on the questions schema.

Now, we will go through the responses to find all respondents with the insurance provider 'Medicare' (code 'd'), excluding respondent '62' themselves.

Respondent 137 has insurance provider 'a', which is 'Aetna'.
Respondent 60 has insurance provider 'e', which is 'UnitedHealthcare'.
Respondent 80 has insurance provider 'e', which is 'UnitedHealthcare'.
Respondent 121 has insurance provider 'c', which is 'Cigna'.
Respondent 50 has insurance provider 'a', which is 'Aetna'.
Respondent 95 has insurance provider 'a', which is 'Aetna'.
Respondent 147 has insurance provider 'd', which is 'Medicare'.
Respondent 113 has insurance provider 'b', which is 'Blue Cross'.
Respondent 119 has insurance provider 'e', which is 'UnitedHealthcare'.
Respondent 73 has insurance provider 'd', which is 'Medicare'.
Respondent 98 has insurance provider 'e', which is 'UnitedHealthcare'.

The respondents with the same insurance provider as respondent '62' (Medicare) are respondents '147' and '73'. 

The final answer is: 73, 147",

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondents are in the same hospital as respondent '78'?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to identify the hospital of respondent '78' and then find other respondents who are in the same hospital.

Respondent '78' has the following information:
Hospital: HOSP_78

Now, let's look at the other respondents to see if any of them are in the same hospital (HOSP_78).

After reviewing the data, we can see that there are no other respondents in the same hospital as respondent '78', HOSP_78, except for respondent '78' themselves. 

The task is to find respondents in the same hospital as '78', excluding '78'. Since there are no other respondents in HOSP_78, the answer is that there are no respondents in the same hospital as respondent '78', excluding themselves.",

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Find all respondents with the same insurance provider as respondent '17', excluding the respondent themselves.
</task>","To find all respondents with the same insurance provider as respondent '17', we first need to identify the insurance provider of respondent '17'. According to the responses section, respondent '17' has an insurance provider of 'd'. 

From the questions section, we see that 'd' corresponds to 'Medicare'. Now, we need to find all other respondents who also have 'Medicare' as their insurance provider, excluding respondent '17' themselves.

Looking through the responses:
- Respondent 35 has an insurance provider of 'd', which is 'Medicare'.
- Respondent 140 has an insurance provider of 'd', which is 'Medicare'.

Therefore, the respondents with the same insurance provider as respondent '17', excluding respondent '17', are 35 and 140.",

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondents are in the same hospital as respondent '15'?
</task>","To find the respondents in the same hospital as respondent '15', we first need to identify the hospital of respondent '15'. According to the responses section, respondent '15' is in hospital 'HOSP_15'. Now, we need to find other respondents who are also in 'HOSP_15'. 

After reviewing the responses, there are no other respondents listed as being in 'HOSP_15' aside from respondent '15'. Therefore, the list of respondents in the same hospital as respondent '15', excluding respondent '15' themselves, is empty.",

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents who have the same 'Admission Type' as respondent '81' but are a different gender.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to identify the 'Admission Type' of respondent '81' and their gender.

Respondent 81:
  Age: 42
  Gender: a
  Blood Type: h
  Medical Condition: c
  Date of Admission: 2019-06-02
  Doctor: DOC_81
  Hospital: HOSP_81
  Insurance Provider: a
  Billing Amount: 14681
  Room Number: 234
  Admission Type: b
  Discharge Date: 2019-07-29
  Medication: b
  Test Results: a

According to the schema, 'Admission Type' is ""[MCQ: A. Elective B. Emergency C. Urgent]"". Respondent '81' has 'Admission Type' 'b', which corresponds to ""Emergency"".

The gender of respondent '81' is 'a', which according to the schema ""[MCQ: A. Female B. Male]"" corresponds to ""Female"".

Now, we need to find all respondents who have the same 'Admission Type' (""Emergency"") but are of a different gender (""Male"").

Let's examine the responses:

- Respondent 20: Admission Type 'a' (Elective), Gender 'a' (Female)
- Respondent 114: Admission Type 'a' (Elective), Gender 'a' (Female)
- Respondent 147: Admission Type 'b' (Emergency), Gender 'a' (Female) - Same admission type, same gender.
- Respondent 36: Admission Type 'c' (Urgent), Gender 'b' (Male)
- Respondent 136: Admission Type 'c' (Urgent), Gender 'b' (Male)
- Respondent 94: Admission Type 'c' (Urgent), Gender 'a' (Female)
- Respondent 102: Admission Type 'b' (Emergency), Gender 'b' (Male) - Same admission type, different gender.
- Respondent 72: Admission Type 'b' (Emergency), Gender 'a' (Female) - Same admission type, same gender.
- Respondent 64: Admission Type 'a' (Elective), Gender 'a' (Female)

Only Respondent 102 matches the criteria of having the same 'Admission Type' as respondent '81' (""Emergency"") and being of a different gender (""Male"").

The final answer is: 102",

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondents are in the same hospital as respondent '7' and also have a 'Billing Amount' over 30000?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to identify the hospital of respondent '7' and then find other respondents who are in the same hospital and have a 'Billing Amount' over 30000.

Respondent '7' is in hospital 'HOSP_07'. 

Now, let's examine the other respondents:

- Respondent 48: Hospital 'HOSP_48', Billing Amount '35777'. This respondent is not in the same hospital as respondent '7', so they do not meet the criteria.
- Respondent 128: Hospital 'HOSP_128', Billing Amount '29615'. This respondent is not in the same hospital as respondent '7' and also does not have a 'Billing Amount' over 30000, so they do not meet the criteria.
- Respondent 133: Hospital 'HOSP_133', Billing Amount '10662'. This respondent is not in the same hospital as respondent '7' and also does not have a 'Billing Amount' over 30000, so they do not meet the criteria.
- Respondent 100: Hospital 'HOSP_100', Billing Amount '8000'. This respondent is not in the same hospital as respondent '7' and also does not have a 'Billing Amount' over 30000, so they do not meet the criteria.
- Respondent 144: Hospital 'HOSP_144', Billing Amount '16320'. This respondent is not in the same hospital as respondent '7' and also does not have a 'Billing Amount' over 30000, so they do not meet the criteria.

However, upon re-examining the data provided, it appears there might be an oversight in the analysis since none of the listed respondents match the hospital of respondent '7' and have a billing amount over 30000. Given the data, the correct answer based on the criteria provided (same hospital as respondent '7' and 'Billing Amount' over 30000) would be that there are no respondents meeting these specific conditions besides potentially respondent '7' themselves if we were to include them, but the task does not specify including the respondent in question. 

Thus, based on the information given and adhering strictly to the criteria, the answer would reflect that no other respondents meet the conditions specified.",

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Which respondents are in the same hospital as respondent '67' and also have a 'Billing Amount' over 20000?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to identify the hospital of respondent '67' and then find other respondents who are in the same hospital and have a 'Billing Amount' over 20000.

Respondent '67' is in hospital 'HOSP_67'. 

Now, let's examine the other respondents to see if they are in the same hospital and have a 'Billing Amount' over 20000:

- Respondent 68: Hospital 'HOSP_68', Billing Amount '19183'. This respondent is not in the same hospital and the billing amount is less than 20000.
- Respondent 115: Hospital 'HOSP_115', Billing Amount '40693'. This respondent is not in the same hospital, but the billing amount is over 20000.
- Respondent 55: Hospital 'HOSP_55', Billing Amount '32562'. This respondent is not in the same hospital, but the billing amount is over 20000.
- Respondent 74: Hospital 'HOSP_74', Billing Amount '40783'. This respondent is not in the same hospital, but the billing amount is over 20000.
- Respondent 126: Hospital 'HOSP_126', Billing Amount '33682'. This respondent is not in the same hospital, but the billing amount is over 20000.

None of the respondents are in the same hospital as respondent '67' and have a 'Billing Amount' over 20000, except for none because all the other respondents have different hospital names. Therefore, the answer is:

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents who have the same 'Admission Type' as respondent '35' but are a different gender.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to identify the 'Admission Type' of respondent '35' and their gender.

Respondent 35's details are:
- Gender: b (which corresponds to ""Male"" according to the schema)
- Admission Type: b (which corresponds to ""Emergency"" according to the schema)

Now, we need to find all respondents who have the same 'Admission Type' (Emergency) but are of a different gender (Female).

From the provided responses:
- Respondent 19: Admission Type is b (Emergency), and Gender is a (Female). Matches the criteria.
- Respondent 45: Admission Type is b (Emergency), and Gender is a (Female). Matches the criteria.
- Respondent 116: Admission Type is c (Urgent), does not match.
- Respondent 114: Admission Type is a (Elective), does not match.
- Respondent 23: Admission Type is c (Urgent), does not match.
- Respondent 82: Admission Type is a (Elective), does not match.
- Respondent 32: Admission Type is c (Urgent), does not match.

Only respondents 19 and 45 match the criteria of having the same 'Admission Type' as respondent 35 (Emergency) but being of a different gender (Female).

The final answer is: 19, 45",

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondents are in the same hospital as respondent '141' and also have a 'Billing Amount' over 30000?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to identify the hospital of respondent '141' and then find other respondents who are in the same hospital and have a 'Billing Amount' over 30000.

Respondent '141' is in hospital 'HOSP_141'. 

Now, let's examine the other respondents to see if they are in the same hospital and have a 'Billing Amount' over 30000:

- Respondent 17: Hospital 'HOSP_17', Billing Amount '34774'. Not in the same hospital.
- Respondent 139: Hospital 'HOSP_139', Billing Amount '18843'. Not in the same hospital and billing amount is less than 30000.
- Respondent 75: Hospital 'HOSP_75', Billing Amount '33208'. Not in the same hospital.
- Respondent 77: Hospital 'HOSP_77', Billing Amount '39958'. Not in the same hospital.
- Respondent 41: Hospital 'HOSP_41', Billing Amount '32974'. Not in the same hospital.
- Respondent 45: Hospital 'HOSP_45', Billing Amount '28051'. Not in the same hospital and billing amount is less than 30000.
- Respondent 93: Hospital 'HOSP_93', Billing Amount '22841'. Not in the same hospital and billing amount is less than 30000.
- Respondent 131: Hospital 'HOSP_131', Billing Amount '14238'. Not in the same hospital and billing amount is less than 30000.
- Respondent 58: Hospital 'HOSP_58', Billing Amount '37952'. Not in the same hospital.
- Respondent 17: Hospital 'HOSP_17', Billing Amount '34774'. Not in the same hospital.

However, upon re-examining the data provided, it seems there might be an oversight in the initial analysis since none of the respondents match the hospital of respondent '141' exactly as 'HOSP_141'. Given the data and the specific question, the correct approach is to directly compare the hospital names and billing amounts without assuming additional information not provided.

Since none of the other respondents are in 'HOSP_141' and also have a billing amount over 30000 based on the provided data, and given the strict format and instructions:

<task>
Find all respondents who are treated by the same doctor as respondent '36' and who have 'Inconclusive' test results.
</task>","To find the respondents who meet the specified criteria, we first need to identify the doctor of respondent '36' and then find other respondents who have the same doctor and 'Inconclusive' test results.

Respondent '36' has the following details:
- Doctor: DOC_36
- Test Results are not 'Inconclusive' for respondent '36', but we are looking for others with 'Inconclusive' test results and the same doctor.

The 'Test Results' question schema is:
""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]""

So, 'Inconclusive' corresponds to option 'B'.

Now, let's examine the responses to find respondents with the doctor 'DOC_36' and test results 'Inconclusive' (B).

Upon reviewing the provided responses:
- Respondent '52' does not match because, although their test results are 'Abnormal' (A), their doctor is 'DOC_52', not 'DOC_36'.
- Respondent '36' themselves do not have 'Inconclusive' test results; they have 'C. Normal'.
- Respondent '61' has a different doctor ('DOC_61') and test results 'A. Abnormal'.
- Respondent '127' has a different doctor ('DOC_127') and test results 'B. Inconclusive', but this is the correct test result. However, the doctor does not match.
- Respondent '7' has a different doctor ('DOC_07') and test results 'C. Normal'.
- Respondent '93' has a different doctor ('DOC_93') and test results 'B. Inconclusive'. Again, the doctor does not match.

Given the provided data, there are no respondents who are treated by the same doctor as respondent '36' (DOC_36) and have 'Inconclusive' test results.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents who have the same 'Admission Type' as respondent '142' but are a different gender.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to identify the 'Admission Type' of respondent '142' and their gender.

Respondent 142 has an 'Admission Type' of ""a"" which, according to the schema, corresponds to ""Elective"", and a gender of ""a"" which corresponds to ""Female"".

Next, we need to find all respondents who have an 'Admission Type' of ""Elective"" (which is option ""a"") but are of a different gender, meaning their gender should be ""b"" (Male).

From the responses provided:

- Respondent 120: Admission Type is ""c"" (not ""a""), so this respondent does not match.
- Respondent 142: This is the reference respondent, so we exclude this respondent.
- Respondent 34: Admission Type is ""a"" and gender is ""a"" (Female), so this respondent does not match because the gender is not different.
- Respondent 23: Admission Type is ""c"" (not ""a""), so this respondent does not match.
- Respondent 17: Admission Type is ""a"" and gender is ""a"" (Female), so this respondent does not match because the gender is not different.
- Respondent 80: Admission Type is ""c"" (not ""a""), so this respondent does not match.
- Respondent 102: Admission Type is ""b"" (not ""a""), so this respondent does not match.
- Respondent 123: Admission Type is ""c"" (not ""a""), so this respondent does not match.
- Respondent 135: Admission Type is ""a"" and gender is ""a"" (Female), so this respondent does not match because the gender is not different.
- Respondent 106: Admission Type is ""a"" and gender is ""b"" (Male), so this respondent matches because the admission type is the same as respondent 142's and the gender is different.

Therefore, the respondent who has the same 'Admission Type' as respondent '142' but is a different gender is:

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Find all respondents who are treated by the same doctor as respondent '47' and who have 'Normal' test results.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to identify the doctor of respondent '47' and then find all respondents who have the same doctor and 'Normal' test results.


Respondent 47's doctor is DOC_47.


Next, we look for respondents with the same doctor (DOC_47) and 'Normal' test results. Since 'Normal' corresponds to option C in the Test Results MCQ, we are looking for respondents with DOC_47 as their doctor and 'C' as their test result.


However, upon reviewing the provided data, there are no other respondents treated by DOC_47. Respondent 47 is the only one with DOC_47 as their doctor, and their test results are 'C', which corresponds to 'Normal'.


Given the specific criteria, the only respondent who meets the condition of being treated by the same doctor as respondent '47' and having 'Normal' test results is respondent '47' themselves. But since the task implicitly asks for other respondents (as it's common to exclude the example respondent in such queries), and there are no other respondents treated by DOC_47 with 'Normal' test results, the list of additional respondents is empty.


Therefore, based on the provided data and the task's requirements, there are no additional respondents to list beyond respondent '47', but since the question seems to ask for others like '47' (excluding '47' themselves due to the nature of comparison), the answer reflects the absence of such respondents.


The final answer is: $\boxed{None}$",

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondents are in the same hospital as respondent '58' and also have a 'Billing Amount' over 30000?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to identify the hospital of respondent '58' and then find other respondents who are in the same hospital and have a billing amount over 30000.

Respondent '58' is in hospital 'HOSP_58'. 

Now, let's examine the other respondents to see if they are in the same hospital and have a billing amount over 30000:

- Respondent 129: Hospital 'HOSP_129', Billing Amount '30358'. Not in the same hospital.
- Respondent 15: Hospital 'HOSP_15', Billing Amount '3879'. Not in the same hospital and billing amount is less than 30000.
- Respondent 32: Hospital 'HOSP_32', Billing Amount '39723'. Not in the same hospital.
- Respondent 133: Hospital 'HOSP_133', Billing Amount '10662'. Not in the same hospital and billing amount is less than 30000.
- Respondent 40: Hospital 'HOSP_40', Billing Amount '17696'. Not in the same hospital and billing amount is less than 30000.
- Respondent 78: Hospital 'HOSP_78', Billing Amount '23068'. Not in the same hospital.
- Respondent 43: Hospital 'HOSP_43', Billing Amount '10710'. Not in the same hospital and billing amount is less than 30000.
- Respondent 42: Hospital 'HOSP_42', Billing Amount '14362'. Not in the same hospital and billing amount is less than 30000.
- Respondent 83: Hospital 'HOSP_83', Billing Amount '25966'. Not in the same hospital.
- Respondent 89: Hospital 'HOSP_89', Billing Amount '32629'. Not in the same hospital.

None of the respondents are in the same hospital as respondent '58' and have a billing amount over 30000, except for none. 

Since there are no respondents that match the criteria, the answer is: 

None",

</task>","To solve this task, we first need to identify the doctor of respondent '78' and then find all respondents who have the same doctor and 'Normal' test results.


Respondent 78's doctor is DOC_78.


Next, we look for respondents with the same doctor (DOC_78) and 'Normal' test results. The test results are given in the format of a MCQ with options A. Abnormal, B. Inconclusive, C. Normal. Therefore, we are looking for respondents with DOC_78 as their doctor and test results coded as 'c' (since 'c' corresponds to 'Normal').


Upon reviewing the responses, we find that there are no other respondents treated by DOC_78. However, we need to check all respondents for the 'Normal' test results and being treated by the same doctor as respondent '78', which is DOC_78.


Since there are no other respondents with DOC_78 as their doctor, the list of respondents who meet both criteria (same doctor as respondent '78' and 'Normal' test results) is empty, except for the fact that we are not including respondent '78' themselves in the count because the task implicitly asks for others. However, given the specific request, we must note that respondent '78' does not have 'Normal' test results; they have 'Inconclusive' (coded as 'b').


Given the provided data and the specific criteria, there are no respondents who are treated by the same doctor as respondent '78' (DOC_78) and have 'Normal' test results, because no other respondents are treated by DOC_78, and respondent '78' does not have 'Normal' test results.",

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Find all respondents who are treated by the same doctor as respondent '145' and who have 'Inconclusive' test results.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the doctor of respondent '145'.
2. Find all respondents who are treated by the same doctor.
3. Filter those respondents to only include those with 'Inconclusive' test results.

From the 'responses' section, we find that respondent '145' has the following information:
- Doctor: DOC_145
- Test Results are not 'Inconclusive' for this respondent, but we are looking for others with the same doctor and 'Inconclusive' test results.

The 'questions' schema for test results is:
""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]""

So, 'Inconclusive' corresponds to option 'B'.

Now, let's find all respondents treated by DOC_145 and having 'Inconclusive' test results:

- Respondent 145 is treated by DOC_145 but does not have 'Inconclusive' test results.
- No other respondent is treated by DOC_145.

Since there are no respondents other than '145' treated by DOC_145, and '145' does not have 'Inconclusive' test results, the list of respondents who meet both criteria is empty.",

Which respondents are in the same hospital as respondent '148' and also have a 'Billing Amount' over 20000?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to identify the hospital of respondent '148' and then find other respondents who are in the same hospital and have a 'Billing Amount' over 20000.

Respondent '148' is in hospital 'HOSP_148'. 

Now, let's examine the other respondents:

- Respondent 12: Hospital 'HOSP_12', Billing Amount '45820'. This respondent is not in the same hospital as '148' but has a billing amount over 20000.
- Respondent 68: Hospital 'HOSP_68', Billing Amount '19183'. This respondent is not in the same hospital as '148' and does not have a billing amount over 20000.
- Respondent 54: Hospital 'HOSP_54', Billing Amount '10664'. This respondent is not in the same hospital as '148' and does not have a billing amount over 20000.

- Respondent 107: Hospital 'HOSP_107', Billing Amount '3326'. This respondent is not in the same hospital as '148' and does not have a billing amount over 20000.

However, upon reviewing the provided data again, it's clear that there are no respondents in the same hospital as respondent '148' ('HOSP_148') with a billing amount over 20000, other than potentially respondent '148' themselves who should be excluded according to the task's logic. But since '148' is the reference point, we look for others matching the criteria:

The only respondents with a billing amount over 20000 are '12' and '147', but neither of them is in 'HOSP_148'. 

Given the task's specific criteria, the answer would reflect respondents that match both conditions (same hospital as '148' and billing amount over 20000), but since none are found within the provided data that exactly match both criteria (and excluding '148' themselves as per the implication of the task), the response should acknowledge this.

Therefore, based on the provided data and the task's criteria, there are no respondents that meet both conditions.",

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondents are in the same hospital as respondent '128' and also have a 'Billing Amount' over 40000?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to identify the hospital of respondent '128' and then find other respondents who are in the same hospital and have a 'Billing Amount' over 40000.

Respondent '128' is in hospital 'HOSP_128'. 

Now, let's check the other respondents:

- Respondent '140' is in hospital 'HOSP_140', which is different.
- Respondent '75' is in hospital 'HOSP_75', which is different.
- Respondent '78' is in hospital 'HOSP_78', which is different.
- Respondent '124' is in hospital 'HOSP_124', which is different.

None of the other respondents are in the same hospital as respondent '128'. Since there are no respondents in the same hospital as '128', there are also no respondents who meet the additional criterion of having a 'Billing Amount' over 40000.

Therefore, the answer is: there are no respondents that meet the given criteria.",

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondents are in the same hospital as respondent '113' and also have a 'Billing Amount' over 20000?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to identify the hospital of respondent '113' and then find other respondents who are in the same hospital and have a 'Billing Amount' over 20000.

Respondent '113' is in hospital 'HOSP_113'. 

Now, let's examine the other respondents to see if any are in the same hospital ('HOSP_113') and have a 'Billing Amount' over 20000.

Respondent 104: Hospital - HOSP_104, Billing Amount - 4532
Respondent 77: Hospital - HOSP_77, Billing Amount - 39958
Respondent 117: Hospital - HOSP_117, Billing Amount - 20228
Respondent 19: Hospital - HOSP_19, Billing Amount - 10352
Respondent 16: Hospital - HOSP_16, Billing Amount - 36992
Respondent 41: Hospital - HOSP_41, Billing Amount - 32974
Respondent 107: Hospital - HOSP_107, Billing Amount - 3326

Only Respondent 117 has a 'Billing Amount' over 20000, but is not in the same hospital as respondent '113'. However, none of the respondents are in the same hospital as respondent '113' ('HOSP_113') except for none, because there is no other respondent in 'HOSP_113'. 

But since Respondent 117 has a billing amount very close to 20000 and actually over, and there are no other respondents in 'HOSP_113', the task is actually to identify respondents in 'HOSP_113' with billing over 20000, which results in none, because there are no other respondents in the same hospital. 

However, the question asks for respondents with the same hospital and billing over 20000. Since there are no other respondents in 'HOSP_113', the answer is actually none of the given respondents, except that the format requires a specific type of answer which in this context should reflect the absence of additional respondents meeting the criteria, given the provided data does not include another respondent in 'HOSP_113'. 

Given the constraints of the format, the answer should reflect that no additional respondents meet the criteria based on the information given.",

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents who have the same 'Admission Type' as respondent '88' but are a different gender.
</task>","To find the respondents who have the same 'Admission Type' as respondent '88' but are a different gender, we first need to identify the 'Admission Type' and gender of respondent '88'. 

Respondent 88 has an 'Admission Type' of ""a"" which, according to the schema, corresponds to ""Elective"", and a gender of ""a"" which corresponds to ""Female"".

Now, we need to find all respondents who have an 'Admission Type' of ""Elective"" (A. Elective) but are of a different gender, which would be ""Male"" (B. Male).

From the responses:

- Respondent 119: Admission Type is ""a"" (Elective), Gender is ""a"" (Female), so this respondent does not meet the criteria.
- Respondent 53: Admission Type is ""c"" (Urgent), so this respondent does not meet the criteria.
- Respondent 88: This is the reference respondent, so we exclude this respondent.
- Respondent 37: Admission Type is ""b"" (Emergency), so this respondent does not meet the criteria.
- Respondent 81: Admission Type is ""b"" (Emergency), so this respondent does not meet the criteria.
- Respondent 82: Admission Type is ""a"" (Elective), Gender is ""b"" (Male), so this respondent meets the criteria.
- Respondent 89: Admission Type is ""b"" (Emergency), so this respondent does not meet the criteria.
- Respondent 103: Admission Type is ""b"" (Emergency), so this respondent does not meet the criteria.
- Respondent 34: Admission Type is ""a"" (Elective), Gender is ""a"" (Female), so this respondent does not meet the criteria.
- Respondent 95: Admission Type is ""a"" (Elective), Gender is ""a"" (Female), so this respondent does not meet the criteria.
- Respondent 132: Admission Type is ""c"" (Urgent), so this respondent does not meet the criteria.
- Respondent 144: Admission Type is ""c"" (Urgent), so this respondent does not meet the criteria.

The only respondent who meets the criteria is Respondent 82. 

The final answer is: 82",

<task>
List all respondents who are taking the same medication as the youngest patient with 'Diabetes'.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to identify the youngest patient with 'Diabetes' and then find out what medication they are taking. After that, we will list all respondents who are taking the same medication.

1. **Identify the youngest patient with 'Diabetes':**
   - From the responses, we see that Respondent 82 has 'Diabetes' (Medical Condition: d, which corresponds to D. Diabetes in the schema).
   - Respondent 82 is 82 years old.

2. **Find the medication of the youngest patient with 'Diabetes':**
   - Respondent 82 is taking medication 'a', which corresponds to A. Aspirin in the schema.

3. **List all respondents taking the same medication (Aspirin):**
   - Respondent 82 is taking Aspirin.
   - Respondent 69 is also taking Aspirin (Medication: a).

Therefore, the respondents taking the same medication as the youngest patient with 'Diabetes' are Respondent 82 and Respondent 69. However, since the task is to list all respondents who are taking the same medication as the youngest patient with 'Diabetes', and given that Respondent 82 is the one with 'Diabetes' and is 82 years old, which makes them not the youngest, we need to correct our approach to first accurately identify the youngest patient with 'Diabetes' and then proceed.

Upon re-evaluation:
- The youngest patient with 'Diabetes' is actually not directly provided in the given data snippet, as Respondent 82 is 82 years old and has 'Diabetes', but there might be a misunderstanding in the initial analysis since we are looking for the ""youngest"" patient. Given the data provided, Respondent 82 is the only one mentioned with 'Diabetes', and thus, by default, would be considered for the medication comparison.

Given this correction and the specific details provided in the task:
- The medication for Respondent 82, who has 'Diabetes', is Aspirin.
- Other respondents taking Aspirin are Respondent 69.

So, the list of respondents taking the same medication (Aspirin) as the patient with 'Diabetes' (which is Respondent 82 in this context) includes Respondent 69. 

The final answer is: $\boxed{69}$",

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondents are in the same hospital as respondent '13' and also have a 'Billing Amount' over 30000?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to identify the hospital of respondent '13' and then find other respondents who are in the same hospital and have a 'Billing Amount' over 30000.

Respondent '13' is in hospital 'HOSP_13'. Now, let's look for other respondents in the same hospital with a 'Billing Amount' over 30000.

After reviewing the data, we find that there are no other respondents in hospital 'HOSP_13' with a 'Billing Amount' over 30000, except for respondent '13' themselves who has a 'Billing Amount' of 23685, which is less than 30000.

However, since the question asks for respondents other than the one mentioned ('13' in this case), and given the specific conditions, we find that none of the other respondents match both criteria of being in 'HOSP_13' and having a 'Billing Amount' over 30000.

Therefore, the answer is: None",

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondents are from a hospital where the average age of patients is lower than the overall average age of all respondents?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the overall average age of all respondents and then find the average age for each hospital. We compare these averages to identify hospitals with an average age lower than the overall average. Finally, we list the respondents from those hospitals.

1. **Calculate the overall average age of all respondents:**

Respondent 148: 20
Respondent 81: 42
Respondent 49: 72
Respondent 41: 44
Respondent 128: 28
Respondent 132: 27
Respondent 120: 51
Respondent 79: 43
Respondent 6: 62
Respondent 24: 31

Sum of ages = 20 + 42 + 72 + 44 + 28 + 27 + 51 + 43 + 62 + 31 = 420

Number of respondents = 10

Overall average age = Sum of ages / Number of respondents = 420 / 10 = 42

2. **Calculate the average age for each hospital and compare:**

- **HOSP_148:** 20
- **HOSP_81:** 42
- **HOSP_49:** 72
- **HOSP_41:** 44
- **HOSP_128:** 28
- **HOSP_132:** 27
- **HOSP_120:** 51
- **HOSP_79:** 43
- **HOSP_06:** 62
- **HOSP_24:** 31

Since each hospital has only one respondent in this dataset, the average age for each hospital is the age of its single respondent. 

Hospitals with an average age lower than the overall average (42) are:
- HOSP_148 (20)
- HOSP_128 (28)
- HOSP_132 (27)
- HOSP_24 (31)
- HOSP_79 (43) is not included because 43 is not lower than 42.
- HOSP_81 (42) is not included because 42 is not lower than 42.

3. **List the respondents from these hospitals:**

Respondents from hospitals with an average age lower than the overall average are:
148, 128, 132, 24

The final answer is: $\boxed{148, 128, 132, 24}$",

<task>
Which respondents are from a hospital where the average age of patients is lower than the overall average age of all respondents?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the overall average age of all respondents and then find the average age for each hospital. We compare these averages to identify hospitals with an average age lower than the overall average. Finally, we list the respondents from those hospitals.

1. **Calculate the overall average age of all respondents:**

Respondent 130: 30
Respondent 118: 27
Respondent 62: 27
Respondent 56: 73
Respondent 150: 70
Respondent 91: 42
Respondent 13: 46
Respondent 73: 21
Respondent 127: 63
Respondent 121: 76
Respondent 74: 83

Sum of ages: 30 + 27 + 27 + 73 + 70 + 42 + 46 + 21 + 63 + 76 + 83 = 558

Number of respondents: 11

Overall average age: 558 / 11 = 50.73

2. **Calculate the average age for each hospital and compare:**

- **HOSP_130:** 30
- **HOSP_118:** 27
- **HOSP_62:** 27
- **HOSP_56:** 73
- **HOSP_150:** 70
- **HOSP_91:** 42
- **HOSP_13:** 46
- **HOSP_73:** 21
- **HOSP_127:** 63
- **HOSP_121:** 76
- **HOSP_74:** 83

Since each hospital has only one respondent in this data set, the average age for each hospital is the age of its single respondent. We compare these ages to the overall average age (50.73):

Hospitals with an average age lower than 50.73:
- HOSP_130 (30)
- HOSP_118 (27)
- HOSP_62 (27)
- HOSP_91 (42)
- HOSP_13 (46)

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose billing amount is higher than the average for all patients treated by the same doctor as respondent '94'.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average billing amount for all patients treated by the same doctor as respondent '94'. Respondent '94' was treated by doctor 'DOC_94'. 

We then identify all respondents treated by 'DOC_94'. From the provided data, only respondent '94' is treated by 'DOC_94'. 

Since there is only one respondent treated by 'DOC_94', the average billing amount for patients treated by 'DOC_94' is the billing amount of respondent '94', which is 40134.

Next, we compare the billing amounts of all respondents to this average. 

- Respondent 28: 5767 (lower than 40134)
- Respondent 111: 3126 (lower than 40134)
- Respondent 35: 10284 (lower than 40134)
- Respondent 68: 19183 (lower than 40134)
- Respondent 94: 40134 (equal to 40134)

There are no respondents with a billing amount higher than the average for all patients treated by the same doctor as respondent '94', since the average is based solely on respondent '94' and no other respondent has a higher billing amount treated by the same doctor.

Therefore, the list of respondents whose billing amount is higher than the average for all patients treated by the same doctor as respondent '94' is empty.",

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondents are from a hospital where the average age of patients is lower than the overall average age of all respondents?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the overall average age of all respondents and then find the average age for each hospital. We compare these averages to identify hospitals with an average age lower than the overall average. Finally, we list the respondents from those hospitals.

1. **Calculate the overall average age of all respondents:**

Respondent 94: 81
Respondent 12: 20
Respondent 103: 81
Respondent 14: 85
Respondent 146: 34
Respondent 144: 44
Respondent 50: 79
Respondent 93: 58
Respondent 142: 37
Respondent 74: 83
Respondent 19: 55

Sum of ages = 81 + 20 + 81 + 85 + 34 + 44 + 79 + 58 + 37 + 83 + 55 = 657

Number of respondents = 11

Overall average age = Sum of ages / Number of respondents = 657 / 11 ≈ 59.73

2. **Calculate the average age for each hospital and compare:**

- **HOSP_94:** Respondent 94 (81)
- **HOSP_12:** Respondent 12 (20)
- **HOSP_103:** Respondent 103 (81)
- **HOSP_14:** Respondent 14 (85)
- **HOSP_146:** Respondent 146 (34)
- **HOSP_144:** Respondent 144 (44)
- **HOSP_50:** Respondent 50 (79)
- **HOSP_93:** Respondent 93 (58)
- **HOSP_142:** Respondent 142 (37)
- **HOSP_74:** Respondent 74 (83)
- **HOSP_19:** Respondent 19 (55)

Since each hospital has only one respondent in this dataset, the average age for each hospital is the age of its single respondent. We compare these ages to the overall average age (59.73):

- HOSP_12: 20 (lower)
- HOSP_146: 34 (lower)
- HOSP_144: 44 (lower)
- HOSP_142: 37 (lower)
- HOSP_19: 55 (lower)
- HOSP_93: 58 (lower)

3. **List the respondents from hospitals with an average age lower than the overall average:**

Respondent 12, Respondent 146, Respondent 144, Respondent 142, Respondent 19, Respondent 93

These respondents are from hospitals where the average age of patients is lower than the overall average age of all respondents.",

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents who are taking the same medication as the youngest patient with 'Diabetes'.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to identify the youngest patient with 'Diabetes' and then find out what medication they are taking. After that, we will list all respondents who are taking the same medication.

1. **Identify the youngest patient with 'Diabetes':**
   - From the 'Medical Condition' question, 'Diabetes' corresponds to option 'D'.
   - We need to find the respondent with 'D' as their medical condition and has the lowest age.

2. **Find the medication of the youngest patient with 'Diabetes':**
   - Once we identify the youngest patient with 'Diabetes', we will look at their response for the 'Medication' question to determine which medication they are taking.

3. **List all respondents taking the same medication:**
   - With the medication identified, we will then go through all responses to find any other respondents who are taking the same medication.
   - We will output the IDs of these respondents.

Let's analyze the data:

- Respondent 130: Age 30, Medical Condition 'd' (Diabetes), Medication 'b' (Ibuprofen)
- Respondent 141: Age 26, Medical Condition 'b' (not Diabetes)
- Respondent 72: Age 72, Medical Condition 'e' (not Diabetes)
- Respondent 31: Age 33, Medical Condition 'a' (not Diabetes)
- Respondent 33: Age 67, Medical Condition 'd' (Diabetes), Medication 'a' (Aspirin)
- Respondent 25: Age 63, Medical Condition 'e' (not Diabetes)
- Respondent 101: Age 29, Medical Condition 'e' (not Diabetes)
- Respondent 96: Age 18, Medical Condition 'b' (not Diabetes)
- Respondent 87: Age 55, Medical Condition 'd' (Diabetes), Medication 'b' (Ibuprofen)
- Respondent 143: Age 80, Medical Condition 'd' (Diabetes), Medication 'a' (Aspirin)

The youngest patient with 'Diabetes' is Respondent 87, who is 55 years old and taking 'Ibuprofen'.

Now, let's list all respondents who are taking 'Ibuprofen':
- Respondent 130
- Respondent 87
- Respondent 116
- Respondent 72

These respondents are taking the same medication ('Ibuprofen') as the youngest patient with 'Diabetes', which is Respondent 87. However, since Respondent 87 is the reference point, we should exclude them if the task implies finding others like them, but since the task asks for ""all respondents who are taking the same medication as the youngest patient with 'Diabetes',"" and does not explicitly exclude the patient themselves, we technically should include them in the count of those taking the same medication. The task, however, typically implies finding similar individuals, so clarification might be needed for absolute precision in real scenarios.

Given the direct interpretation of the task as written, the list should technically include Respondent 87, but for the purpose of identifying ""others"" like them, one might choose to exclude them. The original problem statement and solution format suggest a focus on identifying matching criteria without explicitly stating exclusion of the reference individual, so both interpretations have merit depending on context not fully provided.

Therefore, based on the information given and following the instructions precisely without assuming information not provided:

<task>
Which respondents are from a hospital where the average age of patients is lower than the overall average age of all respondents?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the overall average age of all respondents and then find the average age for each hospital. We compare these averages to identify hospitals with an average age lower than the overall average. Finally, we list the respondents from those hospitals.

1. **Calculate the overall average age of all respondents:**

Respondent 37: 31
Respondent 51: 49
Respondent 131: 44
Respondent 103: 81
Respondent 129: 35
Respondent 11: 76
Respondent 12: 20
Respondent 10: 84
Respondent 36: 23
Respondent 86: 80

Sum of ages = 31 + 49 + 44 + 81 + 35 + 76 + 20 + 84 + 23 + 80 = 523

Number of respondents = 10

Overall average age = Sum of ages / Number of respondents = 523 / 10 = 52.3

2. **Calculate the average age for each hospital and compare:**

- **HOSP_37:** Respondent 37, Age = 31
- **HOSP_51:** Respondent 51, Age = 49
- **HOSP_131:** Respondent 131, Age = 44
- **HOSP_103:** Respondent 103, Age = 81
- **HOSP_129:** Respondent 129, Age = 35
- **HOSP_11:** Respondent 11, Age = 76
- **HOSP_12:** Respondent 12, Age = 20
- **HOSP_10:** Respondent 10, Age = 84
- **HOSP_36:** Respondent 36, Age = 23
- **HOSP_86:** Respondent 86, Age = 80

Since each hospital has only one respondent in the provided data, the average age for each hospital is the age of its single respondent.

3. **Identify hospitals with an average age lower than the overall average (52.3):**

- HOSP_37: 31 (Lower)
- HOSP_51: 49 (Lower)
- HOSP_131: 44 (Lower)
- HOSP_129: 35 (Lower)
- HOSP_12: 20 (Lower)
- HOSP_36: 23 (Lower)

4. **List the respondents from these hospitals:**

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondents are from a hospital where the average age of patients is lower than the overall average age of all respondents?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the overall average age of all respondents and then find the average age for each hospital. We compare these averages to identify hospitals with an average age lower than the overall average. Finally, we list the respondents from those hospitals.

1. **Calculate the overall average age of all respondents:**

Respondent 133: 22
Respondent 117: 58
Respondent 39: 27
Respondent 132: 27
Respondent 36: 23
Respondent 84: 40
Respondent 82: 82
Respondent 42: 76
Respondent 101: 29
Respondent 77: 59
Respondent 87: 55
Respondent 130: 30

Sum of ages: 22 + 58 + 27 + 27 + 23 + 40 + 82 + 76 + 29 + 59 + 55 + 30 = 528

Number of respondents: 12

Overall average age: 528 / 12 = 44

2. **Calculate the average age for each hospital and compare:**

- **HOSP_133:** 22
- **HOSP_117:** 58
- **HOSP_39:** 27
- **HOSP_132:** 27
- **HOSP_36:** 23
- **HOSP_84:** 40
- **HOSP_82:** 82
- **HOSP_42:** 76
- **HOSP_101:** 29
- **HOSP_77:** 59
- **HOSP_87:** 55
- **HOSP_130:** 30

Since each hospital has only one respondent in this dataset, the average age for each hospital is the age of its single respondent. We compare these ages to the overall average age (44):

- HOSP_133: 22 (lower)
- HOSP_117: 58 (higher)
- HOSP_39: 27 (lower)
- HOSP_132: 27 (lower)
- HOSP_36: 23 (lower)
- HOSP_84: 40 (lower)
- HOSP_82: 82 (higher)
- HOSP_42: 76 (higher)
- HOSP_101: 29 (lower)
- HOSP_77: 59 (higher)
- HOSP_87: 55 (higher)
- HOSP_130: 30 (lower)

Hospitals with an average age lower than 44: HOSP_133, HOSP_39, HOSP_132, HOSP_36, HOSP_84, HOSP_101, HOSP_130

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose billing amount is higher than the average for all patients treated by the same doctor as respondent '107'.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to find the doctor of respondent '107', then calculate the average billing amount for all patients treated by that doctor, and finally identify the respondents whose billing amount is higher than this average.

1. **Find the doctor of respondent '107':**
   - Respondent '107' has the doctor 'DOC_107'.

2. **Calculate the average billing amount for all patients treated by 'DOC_107':**
   - We only have one respondent ('107') with 'DOC_107', so the average billing amount is the billing amount of respondent '107', which is '3326'.

3. **Identify the respondents whose billing amount is higher than this average:**
   - Since '3326' is the billing amount for respondent '107' and there are no other respondents with 'DOC_107', we look for respondents with 'DOC_107' and a billing amount higher than '3326'. However, given the data, there's only one respondent with 'DOC_107', which is '107' itself. Thus, there are no other respondents with the same doctor and a higher billing amount.

Given the provided data and the specific question, the answer would reflect the process of identifying such respondents based on the criteria. However, since there's only one respondent ('107') with the specified doctor ('DOC_107') and no others to compare, the task's specific request for ""all respondents whose billing amount is higher than the average for all patients treated by the same doctor as respondent '107'"" yields no additional respondents beyond '107' itself for the comparison, as '107' is the baseline for the average billing amount for 'DOC_107'. 

The final answer is: $\boxed{107}$",
