</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Background (history)' and 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is greater than 3.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to calculate the total score for 'Background (history)' and 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' for each respondent and then count the respondents whose total score is greater than 3.

Based on the provided data:

- Respondent 1: Background (history) = 2, Recommendation (global rating scale) = 2, Total = 4
- Respondent 10: Background (history) = 2, Recommendation (global rating scale) = 2, Total = 4
- Respondent 19: Background (history) = 3, Recommendation (global rating scale) = 3, Total = 6
- Respondent 20: Background (history) = 2, Recommendation (global rating scale) = 3, Total = 5
- Respondent 4: Background (history) = 3, Recommendation (global rating scale) = 2, Total = 5

The respondents with a total score greater than 3 are:
- Respondent 1 (Total = 4)
- Respondent 10 (Total = 4)
- Respondent 19 (Total = 6)
- Respondent 20 (Total = 5)
- Respondent 4 (Total = 5)

There are 5 respondents whose total score for 'Background (history)' and 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is greater than 3.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Identification' and 'Assessment' is greater than 6.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to calculate the total score for 'Identification' and 'Assessment' for each respondent and then count the respondents whose total score is greater than 6.

Based on the provided data:

- Respondent 11: Identification = 3, Assessment = 3, Total = 6
- Respondent 6: Identification = 3, Assessment = 2, Total = 5

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Identification' and 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is greater than 5.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to calculate the total score for 'Identification' and 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' for each respondent and then count the respondents whose total score is greater than 5.

Based on the provided data:

1. Respondent 16: Identification (3) + Recommendation (global rating scale) (3) = 6
2. Respondent 18: Identification (3) + Recommendation (global rating scale) (2) = 5
3. Respondent 7: Identification (3) + Recommendation (global rating scale) (2) = 5
4. Respondent 8: Identification (3) + Recommendation (global rating scale) (3) = 6
5. Respondent 3: Identification (0) + Recommendation (global rating scale) (3) = 3
6. Respondent 17: Identification (3) + Recommendation (global rating scale) (2) = 5
7. Respondent 15: Identification (3) + Recommendation (global rating scale) (2) = 5
8. Respondent 12: Identification (3) + Recommendation (global rating scale) (3) = 6
9. Respondent 2: Identification (3) + Recommendation (global rating scale) (1) = 4
10. Respondent 10: Identification (2) + Recommendation (global rating scale) (2) = 4
11. Respondent 22: Identification (3) + Recommendation (global rating scale) (3) = 6
12. Respondent 1: Identification (-1) + Recommendation (global rating scale) (2) = 1

The respondents with a total score greater than 5 are:
- Respondent 16
- Respondent 8
- Respondent 12
- Respondent 22

There are 4 respondents whose total score for 'Identification' and 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is greater than 5, but since the question asks for a count and not a list of names or IDs, the answer is simply the count.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

10. Respondent 17: Situation = 3, Background (history) = 3, Total = 6
11. Respondent 6: Situation = 2, Background (history) = 3, Total = 5

Now, let's count the respondents whose total score for 'Situation' and 'Background (history)' is greater than 3:
- Respondent 22: 6 (greater than 3)
- Respondent 10: 4 (greater than 3)
- Respondent 1: 4 (greater than 3)
- Respondent 13: 5 (greater than 3)
- Respondent 9: 5 (greater than 3)
- Respondent 21: 5 (greater than 3)
- Respondent 7: 5 (greater than 3)
- Respondent 3: 5 (greater than 3)
- Respondent 18: 5 (greater than 3)
- Respondent 17: 6 (greater than 3)
- Respondent 6: 5 (greater than 3)

All respondents have a total score greater than 3.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose 'Identification' is higher than the average 'Identification' for all sessions on the same date.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Identification' score for each date, and then count the respondents whose 'Identification' score is higher than the average for their respective session dates.

Given data:

- Respondent 18: Date = 2025-05-04, Identification = 3
- Respondent 2: Date = 2025-04-04, Identification = 3
- Respondent 3: Date = 2025-04-04, Identification = 0
- Respondent 16: Date = 2025-05-02, Identification = 3
- Respondent 22: Date = 2025-05-16, Identification = 3
- Respondent 10: Date = 2025-03-14, Identification = 2
- Respondent 14: Date = 2025-03-14, Identification = 3
- Respondent 6: Date = 2025-04-04, Identification = 3

First, calculate the average 'Identification' score for each date:

- 2025-05-04: (3) / 1 = 3
- 2025-04-04: (3 + 0 + 3) / 3 = 6 / 3 = 2
- 2025-05-02: (3) / 1 = 3
- 2025-05-16: (3) / 1 = 3
- 2025-03-14: (2 + 3) / 2 = 5 / 2 = 2.5

Then, identify respondents with 'Identification' scores higher than the average for their date:

- 2025-05-04: Average = 3, Respondent 18 has 3, which is not higher than the average.
- 2025-04-04: Average = 2, Respondents 2 and 6 have 3, which is higher than the average.
- 2025-05-02: Average = 3, Respondent 16 has 3, which is not higher than the average.
- 2025-05-16: Average = 3, Respondent 22 has 3, which is not higher than the average.
- 2025-03-14: Average = 2.5, Respondent 14 has 3, which is higher than the average.

Count of respondents whose 'Identification' is higher than the average for all sessions on the same date: 3 (Respondents 2, 6, and 14).",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score across all rubric items is below the average total score for all sessions.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the total score for each respondent across all rubric items, then find the average total score for all sessions, and finally count the respondents whose total score is below this average.

The rubric items are:
- Identification
- Situation
- Background (history)
- Background (examination)
- Assessment
- Recommendation (clear recommendation)
- Recommendation (global rating scale)

Let's calculate the total score for each respondent:

1. Respondent 21: 3 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 3 = 17
2. Respondent 23: 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 19
3. Respondent 14: 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 2 = 16
4. Respondent 12: 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 3 = 20
5. Respondent 13: 3 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 15
6. Respondent 15: 3 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 17
7. Respondent 19: 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 3 = 20
8. Respondent 17: 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 = 20
9. Respondent 2: 3 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 17

Total scores: 17, 19, 16, 20, 15, 17, 20, 20, 17

Average total score = (17 + 19 + 16 + 20 + 15 + 17 + 20 + 20 + 17) / 9
Average total score = 162 / 9
Average total score = 18

Now, let's count the respondents whose total score is below the average (18):

- Respondent 21: 17 (below)
- Respondent 23: 19 (above)
- Respondent 14: 16 (below)
- Respondent 12: 20 (above)
- Respondent 13: 15 (below)
- Respondent 15: 17 (below)
- Respondent 19: 20 (above)
- Respondent 17: 20 (above)
- Respondent 2: 17 (below)

Respondents with scores below the average: 21, 14, 13, 15, 2

Count of respondents: 5

The final answer is: 5",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose 'Background (examination)' score is equal to the average 'Background (examination)' score for all sessions that occurred on the same date.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Background (examination)' score for each date, and then count the respondents whose 'Background (examination)' score matches this average for their respective session dates.

1. **Calculate Average 'Background (examination)' Score by Date:**

- For '2025-05-02':
  - Respondent 12: Background (examination) = 3
  - Respondent 20: Background (examination) = -1
  - Respondent 1: Background (examination) = 2
  - Average = (3 + (-1) + 2) / 3 = 4 / 3 = 1.33

- For '2025-05-04':
  - Respondent 5: Background (examination) = 3
  - Respondent 18: Background (examination) = 2
  - Respondent 17: Background (examination) = 3
  - Average = (3 + 2 + 3) / 3 = 8 / 3 = 2.67

- For '2025-05-16':
  - Respondent 21: Background (examination) = 1
  - Respondent 4: Background (examination) = 2
  - Respondent 22: Background (examination) = 3
  - Average = (1 + 2 + 3) / 3 = 6 / 3 = 2

- For '2025-03-14':
  - Respondent 13: Background (examination) = 1
  - Respondent 23: Background (examination) = 2
  - Average = (1 + 2) / 2 = 3 / 2 = 1.5

- For '2025-04-04':
  - Respondent 6: Background (examination) = 3
  - Since there's only one respondent for this date, the average is 3.

2. **Count Respondents with 'Background (examination)' Score Equal to the Average for Their Session Date:**

- For '2025-05-02', the average is 1.33. No respondent has a score of 1.33.
- For '2025-05-04', the average is 2.67. No respondent has a score of 2.67.
- For '2025-05-16', the average is 2. Respondent 4 has a score of 2.
- For '2025-03-14', the average is 1.5. No respondent has a score of 1.5.
- For '2025-04-04', the average is 3. Respondent 6 has a score of 3.

**Respondents Matching the Average 'Background (examination)' Score for Their Date:**
- Respondent 4 (Date: 2025-05-16, Score: 2)
- Respondent 6 (Date: 2025-04-04, Score: 3)

1. Calculate the average 'Assessment' score for each session name:
   - III (Sepsis): Respondents 15 and 8. Scores are 2 and 2, respectively. Average = (2 + 2) / 2 = 2.

   - I - MI: Respondent 16. Score is 3. Average = 3.
   - II (Anaphylactic Shock): Respondent 6. Score is 2. Average = 2.

2. Identify sessions with an average 'Assessment' score greater than 1.5:
   - All sessions have an average score greater than 1.5 except none, since the lowest average is 2, which is already greater than 1.5.

3. Count the respondents in sessions with an average 'Assessment' score greater than 1.5:
   - Since all sessions have an average score greater than 1.5, we count all respondents.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose 'Background (examination)' is higher than the average 'Background (examination)' for all sessions on the same date.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Background (examination)' score for each date, and then compare each respondent's score to this average to determine if it's higher.

Given data:

- Respondent 9: Date = 2025-05-04, Background (examination) = 2
- Respondent 7: Date = 2025-03-14, Background (examination) = 3
- Respondent 4: Date = 2025-05-16, Background (examination) = 2
- Respondent 2: Date = 2025-04-04, Background (examination) = 3
- Respondent 14: Date = 2025-03-14, Background (examination) = 2
- Respondent 1: Date = 2025-05-02, Background (examination) = 2
- Respondent 8: Date = 2025-05-02, Background (examination) = 2
- Respondent 22: Date = 2025-05-16, Background (examination) = 3
- Respondent 20: Date = 2025-05-02, Background (examination) = -1

Calculating averages for each date:
- 2025-05-04: (2) / 1 = 2
- 2025-03-14: (3 + 2) / 2 = 2.5
- 2025-05-16: (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5
- 2025-04-04: (3) / 1 = 3
- 2025-05-02: (2 + 2 + -1) / 3 = 1

Now, comparing each respondent's 'Background (examination)' score to the average for their respective date:
- Respondent 9 (2025-05-04): 2 == 2 (not higher)
- Respondent 7 (2025-03-14): 3 > 2.5 (higher)
- Respondent 4 (2025-05-16): 2 < 2.5 (not higher)
- Respondent 2 (2025-04-04): 3 == 3 (not higher)
- Respondent 14 (2025-03-14): 2 < 2.5 (not higher)
- Respondent 1 (2025-05-02): 2 > 1 (higher)
- Respondent 8 (2025-05-02): 2 > 1 (higher)
- Respondent 22 (2025-05-16): 3 > 2.5 (higher)
- Respondent 20 (2025-05-02): -1 < 1 (not higher)

Counting respondents with scores higher than the average for their date: 4 (Respondent 7, Respondent 1, Respondent 8, Respondent 22).

The final answer is: 4",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who participated in a session where the average 'Assessment' for that session name is greater than 2.0.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Assessment' score for each session name, and then count the respondents who participated in sessions where this average is greater than 2.0.

Given the data:

1. Respondent 20: SessionName = IV (VT), Assessment = 3
2. Respondent 2: SessionName = MI, Assessment = 3
3. Respondent 15: SessionName = III - Sepsis, Assessment = 2
4. Respondent 23: SessionName = II-Anaphylaxsis, Assessment = 3
5. Respondent 22: SessionName = IV (VT), Assessment = 2
6. Respondent 8: SessionName = III (Sepsis), Assessment = 2
7. Respondent 19: SessionName = I - MI, Assessment = 2
8. Respondent 13: SessionName = I-VF, Assessment = 2

First, calculate the average 'Assessment' score for each unique SessionName:

- IV (VT): (3 + 2) / 2 = 2.5
- MI: 3 / 1 = 3
- III - Sepsis: 2 / 1 = 2
- II-Anaphylaxsis: 3 / 1 = 3
- III (Sepsis): 2 / 1 = 2
- I - MI: 2 / 1 = 2
- I-VF: 2 / 1 = 2

Then, identify the sessions with an average 'Assessment' greater than 2.0:

- IV (VT) with average = 2.5
- MI with average = 3
- II-Anaphylaxsis with average = 3

Count the respondents in these sessions:

- Respondent 20 (IV (VT))
- Respondent 22 (IV (VT))
- Respondent 2 (MI)
- Respondent 23 (II-Anaphylaxsis)

There are 4 respondents who participated in sessions where the average 'Assessment' is greater than 2.0.

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score across all rubric items is below the average total score for all sessions.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the total score for each respondent across all rubric items, then find the average total score for all sessions, and finally count the respondents whose total score is below this average.

The rubric items are:
- Identification
- Situation
- Background (history)
- Background (examination)
- Assessment
- Recommendation (clear recommendation)
- Recommendation (global rating scale)

Each of these items has a score from 0 to 3.

Let's calculate the total score for each respondent:

1. Respondent 8: 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 18
2. Respondent 18: 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 2 = 17
3. Respondent 7: 3 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 17
4. Respondent 2: 3 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 17
5. Respondent 5: 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 3 = 20
6. Respondent 17: 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 = 20
7. Respondent 10: 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 14
8. Respondent 23: 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 19
9. Respondent 14: 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 2 = 16
10. Respondent 12: 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 3 = 20
11. Respondent 22: 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 19

Now, let's calculate the average total score:
Total sum = 18 + 17 + 17 + 17 + 20 + 20 + 14 + 19 + 16 + 20 + 19 = 187
Number of respondents = 11
Average total score = Total sum / Number of respondents = 187 / 11 = 17

Next, we count the respondents whose total score is below the average (17):
- Respondent 18: 17
- Respondent 7: 17
- Respondent 2: 17
- Respondent 10: 14
- Respondent 14: 16

These respondents have scores below or equal to the average. However, since the task asks for scores ""below"" the average, we only consider those strictly less than 17:
- Respondent 10: 14
- Respondent 14: 16

Thus, there are 2 respondents with total scores strictly below the average total score for all sessions, but considering the instruction to count those ""below"" the average, and given that scores of 17 are exactly at the average, not below it, the correct count should reflect only those with scores less than 17.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$",True

1. Calculate the average 'Assessment' score for each date:
   - For '2025-05-16': Respondents 19 and 22 have 'Assessment' scores of 2 and 2, respectively. The average is (2 + 2) / 2 = 2.
   - For '2025-05-02': Respondents 20 and 8 have 'Assessment' scores of 3 and 2, respectively. The average is (3 + 2) / 2 = 2.5.
   - For '2025-04-04': Respondent 11 has an 'Assessment' score of 3. The average is 3.
   - For '2025-03-14': Respondents 10 and 7 have 'Assessment' scores of 2 and 2, respectively. The average is (2 + 2) / 2 = 2.
   - For '2025-05-04': Respondents 5, 17, and 18 have 'Assessment' scores of 3, 3, and 3, respectively. The average is (3 + 3 + 3) / 3 = 3.

2. Count the respondents whose 'Assessment' score is higher than the average 'Assessment' score for their date:
   - For '2025-05-16': No respondents have a score higher than 2.
   - For '2025-05-02': Respondent 20 has a score of 3, which is higher than the average of 2.5. Respondent 8 does not.
   - For '2025-04-04': No respondents have a score higher than 3, as the average is exactly 3 and there's only one respondent.
   - For '2025-03-14': No respondents have a score higher than 2.
   - For '2025-05-04': No respondents have a score higher than 3, as all have a score of 3, which is the average.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' score is equal to the average 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' score for all sessions that occurred on the same date.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' score for each date, and then count the respondents whose score matches this average for their respective session dates.

Given data:

- Respondent 2: Date = 2025-04-04, Recommendation (clear recommendation) = 2
- Respondent 18: Date = 2025-05-04, Recommendation (clear recommendation) = 2
- Respondent 19: Date = 2025-05-16, Recommendation (clear recommendation) = 3
- Respondent 6: Date = 2025-04-04, Recommendation (clear recommendation) = 2
- Respondent 14: Date = 2025-03-14, Recommendation (clear recommendation) = 1
- Respondent 22: Date = 2025-05-16, Recommendation (clear recommendation) = 2
- Respondent 16: Date = 2025-05-02, Recommendation (clear recommendation) = 2
- Respondent 23: Date = 2025-03-14, Recommendation (clear recommendation) = 3
- Respondent 20: Date = 2025-05-02, Recommendation (clear recommendation) = 2
- Respondent 11: Date = 2025-04-04, Recommendation (clear recommendation) = 3

Calculating average 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' scores by date:

1. 2025-04-04: (2 + 2 + 3) / 3 = 7 / 3 = 2.33
2. 2025-05-04: (2) / 1 = 2
3. 2025-05-16: (3 + 2) / 2 = 5 / 2 = 2.5
4. 2025-03-14: (1 + 3) / 2 = 4 / 2 = 2
5. 2025-05-02: (2 + 2) / 2 = 4 / 2 = 2

Now, checking which respondents have a 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' score equal to the average for their session date:

1. 2025-04-04: Average = 2.33, none of the respondents (2, 6, 11) have this exact score.
2. 2025-05-04: Average = 2, Respondent 18 matches.
3. 2025-05-16: Average = 2.5, none of the respondents (19, 22) have this exact score.
4. 2025-03-14: Average = 2, none of the respondents (14, 23) have this exact score.
5. 2025-05-02: Average = 2, both Respondent 16 and Respondent 20 match.

Counting the respondents who match the average 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' score for their session date:

- Respondent 18
- Respondent 16
- Respondent 20

Therefore, the count of respondents whose 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' score is equal to the average for all sessions on the same date is 3.",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose 'Background (examination)' is higher than the average 'Background (examination)' for all sessions on the same date.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Background (examination)' score for each date, and then compare each respondent's 'Background (examination)' score to this average for their respective date.

Given data:

- Respondent 17: Date = 2025-05-04, Background (examination) = 3
- Respondent 11: Date = 2025-04-04, Background (examination) = 3
- Respondent 14: Date = 2025-03-14, Background (examination) = 2
- Respondent 21: Date = 2025-05-16, Background (examination) = 1
- Respondent 5: Date = 2025-05-04, Background (examination) = 3
- Respondent 10: Date = 2025-03-14, Background (examination) = 2
- Respondent 13: Date = 2025-03-14, Background (examination) = 1
- Respondent 6: Date = 2025-04-04, Background (examination) = 3
- Respondent 23: Date = 2025-03-14, Background (examination) = 2
- Respondent 9: Date = 2025-05-04, Background (examination) = 2
- Respondent 8: Date = 2025-05-02, Background (examination) = 2

Calculating averages by date:
- 2025-05-04: (3 + 3 + 2) / 3 = 8 / 3 = 2.67
- 2025-04-04: (3 + 3) / 2 = 6 / 2 = 3
- 2025-03-14: (2 + 2 + 1 + 2) / 4 = 7 / 4 = 1.75
- 2025-05-16: (1) / 1 = 1
- 2025-05-02: (2) / 1 = 2

Now, comparing each respondent's 'Background (examination)' score to the average for their date:
- Respondent 17 (2025-05-04): 3 > 2.67, Yes
- Respondent 11 (2025-04-04): 3 = 3, No
- Respondent 14 (2025-03-14): 2 > 1.75, Yes
- Respondent 21 (2025-05-16): 1 = 1, No
- Respondent 5 (2025-05-04): 3 > 2.67, Yes
- Respondent 10 (2025-03-14): 2 > 1.75, Yes
- Respondent 13 (2025-03-14): 1 < 1.75, No
- Respondent 6 (2025-04-04): 3 = 3, No
- Respondent 23 (2025-03-14): 2 > 1.75, Yes
- Respondent 9 (2025-05-04): 2 < 2.67, No
- Respondent 8 (2025-05-02): 2 = 2, No

Counting respondents whose 'Background (examination)' is higher than the average for their date: 4 (Respondents 17, 14, 5, 10, 23).

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$",True
