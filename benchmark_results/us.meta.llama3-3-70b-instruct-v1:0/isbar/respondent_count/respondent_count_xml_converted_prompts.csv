<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the respondents who participated in a 'II - Anaphylaxsis' session.
</task>","To answer this question, we need to examine the 'responses' section of the provided data and count the number of respondents who participated in a session named 'II - Anaphylaxsis'.

Upon reviewing the data, we find the following respondents who participated in a 'II - Anaphylaxsis' session:

- Respondent id=""23""
- Respondent id=""12"" (session name is 'II (Anaphylaxis)', which seems to be a variation of 'II - Anaphylaxsis')
- Respondent id=""5"" (session name is 'II - Anaphylaxsis')
- Respondent id=""7"" (session name is 'III-Sepsis', but there's another 'II-Anaphylaxsis' mentioned in respondent id=""23""'s comments, however, this does not count as it is not the session name for respondent id=""7"")

Given the session name variations, it seems there might be slight discrepancies in how session names are recorded. However, based strictly on the session name 'II - Anaphylaxsis' or its closest match 'II (Anaphylaxis)', we identify:

- Respondent id=""23""
- Respondent id=""12""
- Respondent id=""5""

Therefore, the count of respondents who participated in a session named 'II - Anaphylaxsis' or its variation is 3.",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>
</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 'Background (history)' is greater than 5.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to iterate through each respondent's answers, sum the scores for 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 'Background (history)', and then count how many respondents have a total score greater than 5.

Looking at the 'questions' section, we understand that:
- 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is scored as follows: 0 = Not at all confident, 1 = Confident but required extended questioning, 2 = Confident but required some further questioning, 3 = Confident and required little or no questioning.
- 'Background (history)' is scored as follows: 0 = History is unstructured or non-relevant, 1 = Relevant history but frequent clarification needed, 2 = Relevant history with few further questions needed, 3 = Comprehensive focused history.

Now, let's examine the 'responses' section:

1. Respondent 14: 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' = 2, 'Background (history)' = 2. Total = 4.
2. Respondent 6: 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' = 3, 'Background (history)' = 3. Total = 6.
3. Respondent 2: 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' = 1, 'Background (history)' = 2. Total = 3.
4. Respondent 13: 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' = 2, 'Background (history)' = 2. Total = 4.
5. Respondent 16: 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' = 3, 'Background (history)' = 3. Total = 6.
6. Respondent 22: 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' = 3, 'Background (history)' = 3. Total = 6.
7. Respondent 10: 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' = 2, 'Background (history)' = 2. Total = 4.

From the totals calculated, the respondents with a total score greater than 5 are:
- Respondent 6 (Total = 6)
- Respondent 16 (Total = 6)
- Respondent 22 (Total = 6)

Therefore, the count of respondents whose total score for 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 'Background (history)' is greater than 5 is 3.",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Background (history)' and 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is greater than 3.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to iterate through each respondent's answers and calculate the total score for 'Background (history)' and 'Recommendation (global rating scale)'. We then count how many respondents have a total score greater than 3.

From the provided data:

1. Respondent 1: 'Background (history)' = 2, 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' = 2, Total = 4
2. Respondent 10: 'Background (history)' = 2, 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' = 2, Total = 4
3. Respondent 19: 'Background (history)' = 3, 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' = 3, Total = 6
4. Respondent 20: 'Background (history)' = 2, 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' = 3, Total = 5
5. Respondent 4: 'Background (history)' = 3, 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' = 2, Total = 5

Respondents with a total score greater than 3 are: 1, 10, 19, 20, 4.

Therefore, the count of respondents whose total score for 'Background (history)' and 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is greater than 3 is 5.",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who scored 2 on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and whose 'Comments' contain the word 'communication'.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to analyze the 'responses' section of the given dataset and identify the respondents who meet two conditions:

1. They scored 2 on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)'.
2. Their 'Comments' contain the word 'communication'.

Let's examine each respondent:

- Respondent 10: Score on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is 2, but 'Comments' do not contain the word 'communication'.
- Respondent 15: Score on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is 2, and 'Comments' contain the word 'communication' (""Detailed Response - clear communication"").
- Respondent 17: Score on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is 2, but 'Comments' do not contain the word 'communication' explicitly in the context of ""communication skills"" or similar, it mentions ""Concise - clear"" which does not directly imply 'communication'.
- Respondent 18: Score on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is 2, and 'Comments' contain the word 'communication' (""Not very concise or clear communication"").
- Respondent 4: Score on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is 2, and 'Comments' contain the word 'communication' (""Clinical handover and communication skills, satisfactory"").

Based on the analysis, the respondents who scored 2 on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and whose 'Comments' contain the word 'communication' are:

Respondent 15, Respondent 18, Respondent 4, and also Respondent 22 (Score on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is 3, but 'Comments' contain ""Clear communication skills""), however, Respondent 22 does not meet the first condition of scoring 2 on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)'.

Thus, the count of respondents meeting both conditions is 3. 

The final answer is: 3",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Identification' and 'Assessment' is greater than 6.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to iterate through each respondent's answers, sum the scores for 'Identification' and 'Assessment', and count how many respondents have a total score greater than 6.

From the provided data:

1. Respondent 11: Identification = 3, Assessment = 3. Total = 6.
2. Respondent 6: Identification = 3, Assessment = 2. Total = 5.
3. Respondent 15: Identification = 3, Assessment = 2. Total = 5.
4. Respondent 9: Identification = 3, Assessment = 2. Total = 5.
5. Respondent 22: Identification = 3, Assessment = 2. Total = 5.
6. Respondent 1: Identification = -1, Assessment = 3. Total = 2.
7. Respondent 23: Identification = 3, Assessment = 3. Total = 6.
8. Respondent 10: Identification = 2, Assessment = 2. Total = 4.

Only none of the respondents have a total score greater than 6.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Assessment' and 'Identification' is greater than 6.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to iterate through each respondent's answers in the 'responses' section and check their scores for 'Assessment' and 'Identification'. We then sum these scores and check if the total is greater than 6. If it is, we count this respondent.

Looking at the 'questions' section, 'Assessment' is scored as follows: 
- 0 = No logical assessment
- 1 = Assessment only after extended questioning
- 2 = Assessment after minimal questioning
- 3 = Comprehensive logical assessment without questioning

And 'Identification' is scored as follows:
- 0 = Requires direct prompting
- 1 = Introduces themselves but only after a hint
- 2 = Introduces themselves but information is incomplete
- 3 = Introduces themselves and information is complete

Now, let's examine the 'responses' section:

1. Respondent 20: Assessment = 3, Identification = 3. Total = 6. (Not greater than 6)
2. Respondent 8: Assessment = 2, Identification = 3. Total = 5. (Not greater than 6)
3. Respondent 22: Assessment = 2, Identification = 3. Total = 5. (Not greater than 6)
4. Respondent 5: Assessment = 3, Identification = 3. Total = 6. (Not greater than 6)
5. Respondent 16: Assessment = 3, Identification = 3. Total = 6. (Not greater than 6)
6. Respondent 23: Assessment = 3, Identification = 3. Total = 6. (Not greater than 6)
7. Respondent 15: Assessment = 2, Identification = 3. Total = 5. (Not greater than 6)
8. Respondent 12: Assessment = 2, Identification = 3. Total = 5. (Not greater than 6)
9. Respondent 7: Assessment = 2, Identification = 3. Total = 5. (Not greater than 6)
10. Respondent 19: Assessment = 2, Identification = 3. Total = 5. (Not greater than 6)

None of the respondents have a total score for 'Assessment' and 'Identification' greater than 6. 

The final answer is: 0",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Identification' and 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is greater than 5.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to iterate through each respondent's answers in the 'responses' section and calculate the total score for 'Identification' and 'Recommendation (global rating scale)'. We then count how many respondents have a total score greater than 5.

Based on the provided data:

1. Respondent 16: Identification = 3, Recommendation (global rating scale) = 3, Total = 6
2. Respondent 18: Identification = 3, Recommendation (global rating scale) = 2, Total = 5
3. Respondent 7: Identification = 3, Recommendation (global rating scale) = 2, Total = 5
4. Respondent 8: Identification = 3, Recommendation (global rating scale) = 3, Total = 6
5. Respondent 3: Identification = 0, Recommendation (global rating scale) = 3, Total = 3
6. Respondent 17: Identification = 3, Recommendation (global rating scale) = 2, Total = 5
7. Respondent 15: Identification = 3, Recommendation (global rating scale) = 2, Total = 5
8. Respondent 12: Identification = 3, Recommendation (global rating scale) = 3, Total = 6
9. Respondent 2: Identification = 3, Recommendation (global rating scale) = 1, Total = 4
10. Respondent 10: Identification = 2, Recommendation (global rating scale) = 2, Total = 4
11. Respondent 22: Identification = 3, Recommendation (global rating scale) = 3, Total = 6
12. Respondent 1: Identification = -1, Recommendation (global rating scale) = 2, Total = 1

Respondents with a total score greater than 5 are:
- Respondent 16
- Respondent 8
- Respondent 12
- Respondent 22

There are 4 respondents whose total score for 'Identification' and 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is greater than 5.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Situation' and 'Background (history)' is greater than 3.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to iterate through each respondent's answers, sum the scores for 'Situation' and 'Background (history)', and count how many respondents have a total score greater than 3.

Looking at the 'questions' section, we see that both 'Situation' and 'Background (history)' are scored on a rubric from 0 to 3. 

Now, let's examine the 'responses' section:

1. Respondent 22: Situation = 3, Background (history) = 3. Total = 6.
2. Respondent 10: Situation = 2, Background (history) = 2. Total = 4.
3. Respondent 1: Situation = 2, Background (history) = 2. Total = 4.
4. Respondent 13: Situation = 3, Background (history) = 2. Total = 5.
5. Respondent 9: Situation = 3, Background (history) = 2. Total = 5.
6. Respondent 21: Situation = 2, Background (history) = 3. Total = 5.
7. Respondent 7: Situation = 3, Background (history) = 2. Total = 5.
8. Respondent 3: Situation = 2, Background (history) = 3. Total = 5.
9. Respondent 18: Situation = 3, Background (history) = 2. Total = 5.
10. Respondent 17: Situation = 3, Background (history) = 3. Total = 6.
11. Respondent 6: Situation = 2, Background (history) = 3. Total = 5.

From the totals calculated, the respondents with a total score greater than 3 are:
- Respondent 22 (Total = 6)
- Respondent 10 (Total = 4)
- Respondent 1 (Total = 4)
- Respondent 13 (Total = 5)
- Respondent 9 (Total = 5)
- Respondent 21 (Total = 5)
- Respondent 7 (Total = 5)
- Respondent 3 (Total = 5)
- Respondent 18 (Total = 5)
- Respondent 17 (Total = 6)
- Respondent 6 (Total = 5)

All respondents have a score greater than 3. 

The final answer is: 11",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose 'Identification' is higher than the average 'Identification' for all sessions on the same date.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Identification' score for each date, and then count the respondents whose 'Identification' score is higher than the average for their respective date.

1. Calculate the average 'Identification' score for each date:
   - For '2025-05-04', the 'Identification' score is 3. The average is 3.
   - For '2025-04-04', the 'Identification' scores are 3, 0, and 3. The average is (3 + 0 + 3) / 3 = 2.
   - For '2025-05-02', the 'Identification' score is 3. The average is 3.
   - For '2025-05-16', the 'Identification' score is 3. The average is 3.
   - For '2025-03-14', the 'Identification' scores are 2 and 3. The average is (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5.

2. Count the respondents whose 'Identification' score is higher than the average for their date:
   - For '2025-05-04', the score is 3, which is not higher than the average of 3. Count: 0.
   - For '2025-04-04', the scores are 3, 0, and 3. Only the scores of 3 are higher than or equal to the average of 2, but not higher. Count: 0.
   - For '2025-05-02', the score is 3, which is not higher than the average of 3. Count: 0.
   - For '2025-05-16', the score is 3, which is not higher than the average of 3. Count: 0.
   - For '2025-03-14', the scores are 2 and 3. The score of 3 is higher than the average of 2.5. Count: 1.

Therefore, the total count of respondents whose 'Identification' is higher than the average 'Identification' for all sessions on the same date is 1.",True
case_42,respondent_count,Count the respondents whose total score across all rubric items is below the average total score for all sessions.,"<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score across all rubric items is below the average total score for all sessions.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the total score for each respondent across all rubric items, then find the average total score for all sessions, and finally count the respondents whose total score is below this average.

The rubric items are:
- Identification
- Situation
- Background (history)
- Background (examination)
- Assessment
- Recommendation (clear recommendation)
- Recommendation (global rating scale)

Each of these items has a score ranging from 0 to 3.

Let's calculate the total score for each respondent:

1. Respondent 21: 3 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 3 = 17
2. Respondent 23: 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 19
3. Respondent 14: 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 2 = 16
4. Respondent 12: 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 3 = 20
5. Respondent 13: 3 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 15
6. Respondent 15: 3 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 17
7. Respondent 19: 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 3 = 20
8. Respondent 17: 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 = 20
9. Respondent 2: 3 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 17

Total scores are: 17, 19, 16, 20, 15, 17, 20, 20, 17

Average total score = (17 + 19 + 16 + 20 + 15 + 17 + 20 + 20 + 17) / 9
Average total score = 161 / 9
Average total score = 17.89

Now, let's count the respondents whose total score is below the average total score (17.89):

- Respondent 21: 17 (below)
- Respondent 23: 19 (above)
- Respondent 14: 16 (below)
- Respondent 12: 20 (above)
- Respondent 13: 15 (below)
- Respondent 15: 17 (below)
- Respondent 19: 20 (above)
- Respondent 17: 20 (above)
- Respondent 2: 17 (below)

Respondents with scores below the average: 21, 14, 13, 15, 2

Count of respondents with total score below the average: 5

The final answer is: 5",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose 'Background (examination)' score is equal to the average 'Background (examination)' score for all sessions that occurred on the same date.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Background (examination)' score for each date, and then count the respondents whose 'Background (examination)' score matches this average for their respective session dates.

1. **Calculate the average 'Background (examination)' score for each date:**

Looking at the data, the dates mentioned are: 2025-05-04, 2025-05-16, 2025-05-02, 2025-04-04, 2025-03-14.

- For 2025-05-04:
  - Respondent 5: 3
  - Respondent 18: 2
  - Respondent 17: 3
  Average = (3 + 2 + 3) / 3 = 8 / 3 = 2.67

- For 2025-05-16:
  - Respondent 21: 1
  - Respondent 4: 2
  - Respondent 22: 3
  Average = (1 + 2 + 3) / 3 = 6 / 3 = 2

- For 2025-05-02:
  - Respondent 12: 3
  - Respondent 20: -1
  - Respondent 1: 2
  Average = (3 - 1 + 2) / 3 = 4 / 3 = 1.33

- For 2025-04-04:
  - Respondent 6: 3
  Average = 3

- For 2025-03-14:
  - Respondent 13: 1
  - Respondent 23: 2
  Average = (1 + 2) / 2 = 3 / 2 = 1.5

2. **Count the respondents whose 'Background (examination)' score equals the average for their session date:**

- For 2025-05-04, average is 2.67. No respondent exactly matches this average.
- For 2025-05-16, average is 2. Respondent 4 matches this average.
- For 2025-05-02, average is 1.33. No respondent exactly matches this average.
- For 2025-04-04, average is 3. Respondent 6 matches this average.
- For 2025-03-14, average is 1.5. No respondent exactly matches this average.

**Respondents matching the average 'Background (examination)' score for their date:** Respondent 4, Respondent 6.

Therefore, the count of such respondents is 2.",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who participated in a session where the average 'Assessment' for that session name is greater than 1.5.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Assessment' score for each session name, and then count the respondents who participated in sessions where this average is greater than 1.5.

1. **Identify Session Names and Their Corresponding 'Assessment' Scores:**

From the provided data, we can list the session names and their 'Assessment' scores as follows:

- III (Sepsis): 2 (Respondent 15), 2 (Respondent 8)
- IV (VT): 2 (Respondent 22)
- IV - VT: 3 (Respondent 18)
- IV-Hypoglycemia: 3 (Respondent 14)
- I (Myocardial infarction): 2 (Respondent 21)
- I-VF: 2 (Respondent 13)
- V (Hypoglycemia): 3 (Respondent 17)
- I - MI: 3 (Respondent 16)
- II (Anaphylactic Shock): 2 (Respondent 6)

2. **Calculate Average 'Assessment' Score for Each Session Name:**

- III (Sepsis): (2 + 2) / 2 = 2
- IV (VT): 2 / 1 = 2
- IV - VT: 3 / 1 = 3
- IV-Hypoglycemia: 3 / 1 = 3
- I (Myocardial infarction): 2 / 1 = 2
- I-VF: 2 / 1 = 2
- V (Hypoglycemia): 3 / 1 = 3
- I - MI: 3 / 1 = 3
- II (Anaphylactic Shock): 2 / 1 = 2

3. **Identify Sessions with Average 'Assessment' Greater Than 1.5:**

All sessions have an average 'Assessment' score greater than 1.5 since the lowest average score is 2, which is greater than 1.5.

4. **Count Respondents in These Sessions:**

Given that all sessions have an average 'Assessment' score greater than 1.5, we count all respondents:

- Respondent 15
- Respondent 22
- Respondent 18
- Respondent 14
- Respondent 21
- Respondent 13
- Respondent 17
- Respondent 16
- Respondent 8
- Respondent 6

There are 10 respondents in total who participated in sessions where the average 'Assessment' score is greater than 1.5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose 'Background (examination)' is higher than the average 'Background (examination)' for all sessions on the same date.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Background (examination)' score for each date, and then count the respondents whose 'Background (examination)' score is higher than this average for their respective session dates.

Given the data, let's calculate the average 'Background (examination)' score for each date and then identify the respondents with scores higher than these averages.

1. **Calculate Average 'Background (examination)' Scores by Date:**

- For '2025-05-02':
  - Respondent 1: 2
  - Respondent 8: 2
  - Respondent 20: -1
  - Average = (2 + 2 - 1) / 3 = 3 / 3 = 1

- For '2025-05-04':
  - Respondent 9: 2
  - Average = 2

- For '2025-05-16':
  - Respondent 4: 2
  - Respondent 22: 3
  - Average = (2 + 3) / 2 = 5 / 2 = 2.5

- For '2025-03-14':
  - Respondent 7: 3
  - Respondent 14: 2
  - Average = (3 + 2) / 2 = 5 / 2 = 2.5

- For '2025-04-04':
  - Respondent 2: 3
  - Average = 3

2. **Identify Respondents with 'Background (examination)' Scores Higher than the Average for Their Session Date:**

- For '2025-05-02', average is 1:
  - None have a score higher than 1 (all are 2 or -1, but since -1 is lower, we only consider scores above the average, which is none in this case because 2 is indeed higher than 1).

- For '2025-05-04', average is 2:
  - None (only one respondent with a score of 2, which is not higher than the average).

- For '2025-05-16', average is 2.5:
  - Respondent 22 has a score of 3, which is higher than 2.5.

- For '2025-03-14', average is 2.5:
  - Respondent 7 has a score of 3, which is higher than 2.5.

- For '2025-04-04', average is 3:
  - None (the respondent's score is exactly 3, not higher).

**Count of Respondents with 'Background (examination)' Scores Higher than the Average:**

Based on the analysis, there are 2 respondents (Respondent 7 and Respondent 22) whose 'Background (examination)' scores are higher than the average for their respective session dates.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who participated in a session where the average 'Assessment' for that session name is greater than 2.0.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Assessment' score for each session name, and then count the respondents who participated in sessions where this average is greater than 2.0.

Given the data, let's calculate the average 'Assessment' score for each session name:

1. **IV (VT)**: Respondents 20 and 22.
   - Respondent 20's Assessment score: 3
   - Respondent 22's Assessment score: 2
   - Average = (3 + 2) / 2 = 2.5

2. **MI**: Respondent 2.
   - Respondent 2's Assessment score: 3
   - Average = 3

3. **III - Sepsis**: Respondent 15.
   - Respondent 15's Assessment score: 2
   - Average = 2

4. **II-Anaphylaxsis**: Respondent 23.
   - Respondent 23's Assessment score: 3
   - Average = 3

5. **III (Sepsis)**: Respondent 8.
   - Respondent 8's Assessment score: 2
   - Average = 2

6. **I - MI**: Respondent 19.
   - Respondent 19's Assessment score: 2
   - Average = 2

7. **I-VF**: Respondent 13.
   - Respondent 13's Assessment score: 2
   - Average = 2

Sessions with an average 'Assessment' score greater than 2.0 are:
- **IV (VT)** with an average of 2.5
- **MI** with an average of 3
- **II-Anaphylaxsis** with an average of 3

Respondents who participated in these sessions are:
- Respondent 20 (IV (VT))
- Respondent 22 (IV (VT))
- Respondent 2 (MI)
- Respondent 23 (II-Anaphylaxsis)

Therefore, the number of respondents who participated in a session where the average 'Assessment' for that session name is greater than 2.0 is 4.",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score across all rubric items is below the average total score for all sessions.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the total score for each respondent across all rubric items, then find the average total score for all sessions, and finally count the respondents whose total score is below this average.

The rubric items are:
- Identification
- Situation
- Background (history)
- Background (examination)
- Assessment
- Recommendation (clear recommendation)
- Recommendation (global rating scale)

Each of these items has a score from 0 to 3.

Let's calculate the total score for each respondent:

1. Respondent 8: 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 18
2. Respondent 18: 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 2 = 17
3. Respondent 7: 3 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 17
4. Respondent 2: 3 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 17
5. Respondent 5: 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 3 = 20
6. Respondent 17: 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 = 20
7. Respondent 10: 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 14
8. Respondent 23: 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 19
9. Respondent 14: 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 2 = 16
10. Respondent 12: 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 3 = 20
11. Respondent 22: 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 19

Now, let's calculate the average total score:
Total sum = 18 + 17 + 17 + 17 + 20 + 20 + 14 + 19 + 16 + 20 + 19 = 187
Number of respondents = 11
Average total score = Total sum / Number of respondents = 187 / 11 = 17

Next, we count the respondents whose total score is below the average (17):
- Respondent 18: 17 (equal to average, not below)
- Respondent 7: 17 (equal to average, not below)
- Respondent 2: 17 (equal to average, not below)
- Respondent 10: 14 (below average)
- Respondent 14: 16 (below average)
- Respondent 18, 7, and 2 are not below the average, they are exactly at it, so we do not count them.

Therefore, the number of respondents whose total score is below the average total score for all sessions is 2.",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose 'Assessment' is higher than the average 'Assessment' for all sessions on the same date.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Assessment' score for each date, and then count the respondents whose 'Assessment' score is higher than the average 'Assessment' score for their respective session dates.

1. Calculate the average 'Assessment' score for each date:
   - For '2025-05-16': Respondents 19 and 22 have 'Assessment' scores of 2 and 2, respectively. Average = (2 + 2) / 2 = 2.
   - For '2025-05-02': Respondents 20 and 8 have 'Assessment' scores of 3 and 2, respectively. Average = (3 + 2) / 2 = 2.5.
   - For '2025-04-04': Respondent 11 has an 'Assessment' score of 3. Average = 3.
   - For '2025-03-14': Respondents 10 and 7 have 'Assessment' scores of 2 and 2, respectively. Average = (2 + 2) / 2 = 2.
   - For '2025-05-04': Respondents 5, 17, and 18 have 'Assessment' scores of 3, 3, and 3, respectively. Average = (3 + 3 + 3) / 3 = 3.

2. Count the respondents whose 'Assessment' score is higher than the average for their date:
   - For '2025-05-16': No respondents have a score higher than 2.
   - For '2025-05-02': Respondent 20 has a score of 3, which is higher than 2.5.
   - For '2025-04-04': No respondents have a score higher than 3 (since the average is exactly 3, and no one scored higher than 3).
   - For '2025-03-14': No respondents have a score higher than 2.
   - For '2025-05-04': No respondents have a score higher than 3.

Therefore, the only respondent whose 'Assessment' score is higher than the average 'Assessment' score for their session date is respondent 20.

The final answer is: 1",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' score is equal to the average 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' score for all sessions that occurred on the same date.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' score for each date, and then count the respondents whose score matches this average for their respective session dates.

Given the data, let's calculate the average 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' score for each date:

1. **2025-04-04**:
   - Respondent 2: 2
   - Respondent 6: 2
   - Respondent 11: 3
   - Average = (2 + 2 + 3) / 3 = 7 / 3 = 2.33

2. **2025-03-14**:
   - Respondent 14: 1
   - Respondent 23: 3
   - Average = (1 + 3) / 2 = 4 / 2 = 2

3. **2025-05-02**:
   - Respondent 16: 2
   - Respondent 20: 2
   - Average = (2 + 2) / 2 = 4 / 2 = 2

4. **2025-05-04**:
   - Respondent 18: 2
   - Average = 2

5. **2025-05-16**:
   - Respondent 19: 3
   - Respondent 22: 2
   - Average = (3 + 2) / 2 = 5 / 2 = 2.5

Now, let's identify the respondents whose 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' score equals the average for their session date:

1. **2025-04-04**: None of the respondents have a score of 2.33.
2. **2025-03-14**: None of the respondents have a score of 2.
3. **2025-05-02**: Both Respondent 16 and Respondent 20 have a score of 2, matching the average.
4. **2025-05-04**: Respondent 18 has a score of 2, matching the average.
5. **2025-05-16**: None of the respondents have a score of 2.5.

Counting these respondents gives us a total of 3 respondents (16, 20, and 18) whose 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' score equals the average for their respective session dates.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose 'Background (examination)' is higher than the average 'Background (examination)' for all sessions on the same date.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Background (examination)' score for each date, and then count the respondents whose 'Background (examination)' score is higher than this average for their respective session dates.

Given the data, let's calculate the average 'Background (examination)' score for each date and then identify the respondents with scores higher than these averages.

1. **2025-05-04**:
   - Respondent 17: 3
   - Respondent 5: 3
   - Respondent 9: 2
   - Average = (3 + 3 + 2) / 3 = 8 / 3 = 2.67

2. **2025-04-04**:
   - Respondent 11: 3
   - Respondent 6: 3
   - Average = (3 + 3) / 2 = 6 / 2 = 3

3. **2025-03-14**:
   - Respondent 14: 2
   - Respondent 10: 2
   - Respondent 13: 1
   - Respondent 23: 2
   - Average = (2 + 2 + 1 + 2) / 4 = 7 / 4 = 1.75

4. **2025-05-16**:
   - Respondent 21: 1
   - Since there's only one respondent, the average is 1.

5. **2025-05-02**:
   - Respondent 8: 2
   - Since there's only one respondent, the average is 2.

Now, let's identify the respondents whose 'Background (examination)' score is higher than the average for their session date:

- **2025-05-04**: None, since all scores are at or below the average of 2.67.
- **2025-04-04**: None, since both scores are exactly at the average of 3.
- **2025-03-14**: None, since all scores are at or below the average of 1.75.
- **2025-05-16**: None, since the score is exactly at the average of 1.
- **2025-05-02**: None, since the score is exactly at the average of 2.

Therefore, the count of respondents whose 'Background (examination)' is higher than the average 'Background (examination)' for all sessions on the same date is **0**.",True
