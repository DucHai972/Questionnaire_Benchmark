</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Background (history)' and 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is greater than 3.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to calculate the total score for 'Background (history)' and 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' for each respondent and then count the respondents whose total score is greater than 3.

## Step 1: Calculate total score for each respondent
- Respondent 1: 'Background (history)' = 2, 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' = 2, Total = 4
- Respondent 10: 'Background (history)' = 2, 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' = 2, Total = 4
- Respondent 19: 'Background (history)' = 3, 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' = 3, Total = 6
- Respondent 20: 'Background (history)' = 2, 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' = 3, Total = 5
- Respondent 4: 'Background (history)' = 3, 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' = 2, Total = 5

## Step 2: Identify respondents with total score greater than 3
- Respondent 1: Total = 4, Meets criteria
- Respondent 10: Total = 4, Meets criteria
- Respondent 19: Total = 6, Meets criteria
- Respondent 20: Total = 5, Meets criteria
- Respondent 4: Total = 5, Meets criteria

## Step 3: Count the respondents meeting the criteria
All 5 respondents have a total score greater than 3.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Assessment' and 'Identification' is greater than 6.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to calculate the total score for 'Assessment' and 'Identification' for each respondent and then count how many of these totals are greater than 6.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Identification' and 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is greater than 5.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to calculate the total score for 'Identification' and 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' for each respondent and then count the respondents whose total score is greater than 5.

Here are the calculations:

### Respondent 16
- **Identification:** 3
- **Recommendation (global rating scale):** 3
Total score: 3 + 3 = 6

### Respondent 18
- **Identification:** 3
- **Recommendation (global rating scale):** 2
Total score: 3 + 2 = 5

### Respondent 7
- **Identification:** 3
- **Recommendation (global rating scale):** 2
Total score: 3 + 2 = 5

### Respondent 8
- **Identification:** 3
- **Recommendation (global rating scale):** 3
Total score: 3 + 3 = 6

### Respondent 3
- **Identification:** 0
- **Recommendation (global rating scale):** 3
Total score: 0 + 3 = 3

### Respondent 17
- **Identification:** 3
- **Recommendation (global rating scale):** 2
Total score: 3 + 2 = 5

### Respondent 15
- **Identification:** 3
- **Recommendation (global rating scale):** 2
Total score: 3 + 2 = 5

### Respondent 12
- **Identification:** 3
- **Recommendation (global rating scale):** 3
Total score: 3 + 3 = 6

### Respondent 2
- **Identification:** 3
- **Recommendation (global rating scale):** 1
Total score: 3 + 1 = 4

### Respondent 10
- **Identification:** 2
- **Recommendation (global rating scale):** 2
Total score: 2 + 2 = 4

### Respondent 22
- **Identification:** 3
- **Recommendation (global rating scale):** 3
Total score: 3 + 3 = 6

### Respondent 1
- **Identification:** -1
- **Recommendation (global rating scale):** 2
Total score: -1 + 2 = 1

Now, let's count the respondents whose total score is greater than 5:
- Respondent 16: 6
- Respondent 8: 6
- Respondent 12: 6
- Respondent 22: 6

There are 4 respondents whose total score for 'Identification' and 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is greater than 5.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Situation' and 'Background (history)' is greater than 3.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to calculate the total score for 'Situation' and 'Background (history)' for each respondent and then count the number of respondents whose total score is greater than 3.

Let's calculate the total score for each respondent:

### Respondent 22
- **Situation:** 3
- **Background (history):** 3
Total score: 3 + 3 = 6

### Respondent 10
- **Situation:** 2
- **Background (history):** 2
Total score: 2 + 2 = 4

### Respondent 1
- **Situation:** 2
- **Background (history):** 2
Total score: 2 + 2 = 4

### Respondent 13
- **Situation:** 3
- **Background (history):** 2
Total score: 3 + 2 = 5

### Respondent 9
- **Situation:** 3
- **Background (history):** 2
Total score: 3 + 2 = 5

### Respondent 21
- **Situation:** 2
- **Background (history):** 3
Total score: 2 + 3 = 5

### Respondent 7
- **Situation:** 3
- **Background (history):** 2
Total score: 3 + 2 = 5

### Respondent 3
- **Situation:** 2
- **Background (history):** 3
Total score: 2 + 3 = 5

### Respondent 18
- **Situation:** 3
- **Background (history):** 2
Total score: 3 + 2 = 5

### Respondent 17
- **Situation:** 3
- **Background (history):** 3
Total score: 3 + 3 = 6

### Respondent 6
- **Situation:** 2
- **Background (history):** 3
Total score: 2 + 3 = 5

Now, let's count the respondents whose total score is greater than 3:
- Respondent 22: 6 (greater than 3)
- Respondent 10: 4 (greater than 3)
- Respondent 1: 4 (greater than 3)
- Respondent 13: 5 (greater than 3)
- Respondent 9: 5 (greater than 3)
- Respondent 21: 5 (greater than 3)
- Respondent 7: 5 (greater than 3)
- Respondent 3: 5 (greater than 3)
- Respondent 18: 5 (greater than 3)
- Respondent 17: 6 (greater than 3)
- Respondent 6: 5 (greater than 3)

All respondents have a total score greater than 3. Therefore, the count is 11.",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose 'Identification' is higher than the average 'Identification' for all sessions on the same date.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Identification' score for each date, and then compare each respondent's 'Identification' score to this average for their respective date.

Given data:

- Respondent 18: Date = 2025-05-04, Identification = 3
- Respondent 2: Date = 2025-04-04, Identification = 3
- Respondent 3: Date = 2025-04-04, Identification = 0
- Respondent 16: Date = 2025-05-02, Identification = 3
- Respondent 22: Date = 2025-05-16, Identification = 3
- Respondent 10: Date = 2025-03-14, Identification = 2
- Respondent 14: Date = 2025-03-14, Identification = 3
- Respondent 6: Date = 2025-04-04, Identification = 3

Let's calculate the average 'Identification' score for each date:

1. 2025-05-04: Only Respondent 18, so average = 3
2. 2025-04-04: Respondents 2, 3, and 6, so average = (3 + 0 + 3) / 3 = 6 / 3 = 2
3. 2025-05-02: Only Respondent 16, so average = 3
4. 2025-05-16: Only Respondent 22, so average = 3
5. 2025-03-14: Respondents 10 and 14, so average = (2 + 3) / 2 = 5 / 2 = 2.5

Now, let's compare each respondent's 'Identification' score to the average for their date:

1. Respondent 18 (2025-05-04): 3 == average, not higher
2. Respondent 2 (2025-04-04): 3 > average (2), higher
3. Respondent 3 (2025-04-04): 0 < average (2), not higher
4. Respondent 16 (2025-05-02): 3 == average, not higher
5. Respondent 22 (2025-05-16): 3 == average, not higher
6. Respondent 10 (2025-03-14): 2 < average (2.5), not higher
7. Respondent 14 (2025-03-14): 3 > average (2.5), higher
8. Respondent 6 (2025-04-04): 3 > average (2), higher

Counting the respondents whose 'Identification' is higher than the average for their date: Respondent 2, Respondent 6, and Respondent 14.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$",True
case_42,respondent_count,Count the respondents whose total score across all rubric items is below the average total score for all sessions.,"# Survey Data

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score across all rubric items is below the average total score for all sessions.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the total score for each respondent across all rubric items, then find the average total score for all sessions, and finally count the respondents whose total score is below this average.

The rubric items are:
- **Identification**
- **Situation**
- **Background (history)**
- **Background (examination)**
- **Assessment**
- **Recommendation (clear recommendation)**
- **Recommendation (global rating scale)**

Let's calculate the total score for each respondent:

### Respondent 21
- **Identification:** 3
- **Situation:** 2
- **Background (history):** 3
- **Background (examination):** 1
- **Assessment:** 2
- **Recommendation (clear recommendation):** 3
- **Recommendation (global rating scale):** 3
Total Score: 3 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 3 = 17

### Respondent 23
- **Identification:** 3
- **Situation:** 3
- **Background (history):** 2
- **Background (examination):** 2
- **Assessment:** 3
- **Recommendation (clear recommendation):** 3
- **Recommendation (global rating scale):** 3
Total Score: 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 19

### Respondent 14
- **Identification:** 3
- **Situation:** 3
- **Background (history):** 2
- **Background (examination):** 2
- **Assessment:** 3
- **Recommendation (clear recommendation):** 1
- **Recommendation (global rating scale):** 2
Total Score: 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 2 = 16

### Respondent 12
- **Identification:** 3
- **Situation:** 3
- **Background (history):** 3
- **Background (examination):** 3
- **Assessment:** 2
- **Recommendation (clear recommendation):** 3
- **Recommendation (global rating scale):** 3
Total Score: 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 3 = 20

### Respondent 13
- **Identification:** 3
- **Situation:** 3
- **Background (history):** 2
- **Background (examination):** 1
- **Assessment:** 2
- **Recommendation (clear recommendation):** 2
- **Recommendation (global rating scale):** 2
Total Score: 3 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 15

### Respondent 15
- **Identification:** 3
- **Situation:** 3
- **Background (history):** 2
- **Background (examination):** 3
- **Assessment:** 2
- **Recommendation (clear recommendation):** 2
- **Recommendation (global rating scale):** 2
Total Score: 3 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 17

### Respondent 19
- **Identification:** 3
- **Situation:** 3
- **Background (history):** 3
- **Background (examination):** 3
- **Assessment:** 2
- **Recommendation (clear recommendation):** 3
- **Recommendation (global rating scale):** 3
Total Score: 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 3 = 20

### Respondent 17
- **Identification:** 3
- **Situation:** 3
- **Background (history):** 3
- **Background (examination):** 3
- **Assessment:** 3
- **Recommendation (clear recommendation):** 3
- **Recommendation (global rating scale):** 2
Total Score: 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 = 20

### Respondent 2
- **Identification:** 3
- **Situation:** 3
- **Background (history):** 2
- **Background (examination):** 3
- **Assessment:** 3
- **Recommendation (clear recommendation):** 2
- **Recommendation (global rating scale):** 1
Total Score: 3 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 17

Now, let's calculate the average total score:
Total Scores: 17, 19, 16, 20, 15, 17, 20, 20, 17
Sum of Total Scores: 17 + 19 + 16 + 20 + 15 + 17 + 20 + 20 + 17 = 161
Number of Respondents: 8
Average Total Score: 161 / 8 = 20.125

Finally, let's count the respondents whose total score is below the average total score (20.125):
- Respondent 21: 17 (Below)
- Respondent 23: 19 (Below)
- Respondent 14: 16 (Below)
- Respondent 12: 20 (Not Below)
- Respondent 13: 15 (Below)
- Respondent 15: 17 (Below)
- Respondent 19: 20 (Not Below)
- Respondent 17: 20 (Not Below)
- Respondent 2: 17 (Below)

Respondents with scores below the average: 5

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$",True

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose 'Background (examination)' score is equal to the average 'Background (examination)' score for all sessions that occurred on the same date.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Background (examination)' score for each date, and then count the respondents whose 'Background (examination)' score matches this average for their respective session dates.

1. **Calculate Average 'Background (examination)' Score by Date:**

- For '2025-05-02':
  - Respondent 12: 3
  - Respondent 20: -1
  - Respondent 1: 2
  - Average = (3 + (-1) + 2) / 3 = 4 / 3 = 1.33

- For '2025-05-04':
  - Respondent 5: 3
  - Respondent 18: 2
  - Respondent 17: 3
  - Average = (3 + 2 + 3) / 3 = 8 / 3 = 2.67

- For '2025-05-16':
  - Respondent 21: 1
  - Respondent 4: 2
  - Respondent 22: 3
  - Average = (1 + 2 + 3) / 3 = 6 / 3 = 2

- For '2025-03-14':
  - Respondent 13: 1
  - Respondent 23: 2
  - Average = (1 + 2) / 2 = 3 / 2 = 1.5

- For '2025-04-04':
  - Respondent 6: 3
  - Since there's only one respondent for this date, the average is 3.

2. **Count Respondents with 'Background (examination)' Score Equal to the Average for Their Date:**

- For '2025-05-02', the average is 1.33. No respondent has a score of 1.33.
- For '2025-05-04', the average is 2.67. No respondent has a score of 2.67.
- For '2025-05-16', the average is 2. Respondent 4 has a score of 2.
- For '2025-03-14', the average is 1.5. No respondent has a score of 1.5.
- For '2025-04-04', the average is 3. Respondent 6 has a score of 3.

Here are the steps with calculations:

1. **Calculate the average 'Assessment' score for each session name:**

- **III (Sepsis):** Respondent 15 (Assessment: 2), Respondent 8 (Assessment: 2). Average = (2 + 2) / 2 = 2.
- **IV (VT):** Respondent 22 (Assessment: 2), Respondent 18 (Assessment: 3). Average = (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5.
- **IV-Hypoglycemia:** Respondent 14 (Assessment: 3). Average = 3.
- **I (Myocardial infarction):** Respondent 21 (Assessment: 2). Average = 2.
- **I-VF:** Respondent 13 (Assessment: 2). Average = 2.
- **V (Hypoglycemia):** Respondent 17 (Assessment: 3). Average = 3.
- **I - MI:** Respondent 16 (Assessment: 3). Average = 3.
- **II (Anaphylactic Shock):** Respondent 6 (Assessment: 2). Average = 2.

2. **Identify sessions with an average 'Assessment' score greater than 1.5:**

- All sessions have an average score greater than 1.5 except none, since the lowest average is 2, which is already greater than 1.5.

3. **Count the respondents who participated in those sessions:**

Since all sessions have an average 'Assessment' score greater than 1.5, we count all respondents:
- Respondent 15
- Respondent 22
- Respondent 18
- Respondent 14
- Respondent 21
- Respondent 13
- Respondent 8
- Respondent 17
- Respondent 16
- Respondent 6

There are **10** respondents in total who participated in sessions where the average 'Assessment' for that session name is greater than 1.5.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose 'Background (examination)' is higher than the average 'Background (examination)' for all sessions on the same date.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Background (examination)' score for each date, and then compare each respondent's score to this average for their respective date.

1. **Calculate Average 'Background (examination)' Scores by Date:**

- For '2025-05-02':
  - Respondent 1: 2
  - Respondent 8: 2
  - Respondent 20: -1
  - Average = (2 + 2 - 1) / 3 = 3 / 3 = 1

- For '2025-05-04':
  - Respondent 9: 2
  - Average = 2

- For '2025-05-16':
  - Respondent 4: 2
  - Respondent 22: 3
  - Average = (2 + 3) / 2 = 5 / 2 = 2.5

- For '2025-03-14':
  - Respondent 7: 3
  - Respondent 14: 2
  - Average = (3 + 2) / 2 = 5 / 2 = 2.5

- For '2025-04-04':
  - Respondent 2: 3
  - Average = 3

2. **Compare Each Respondent's Score to the Average for Their Date:**

- '2025-05-02':
  - Respondent 1: 2 (higher than 1)
  - Respondent 8: 2 (higher than 1)
  - Respondent 20: -1 (lower than 1)

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who participated in a session where the average 'Assessment' for that session name is greater than 2.0.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Assessment' score for each session name. Then, we identify the sessions with an average 'Assessment' score greater than 2.0 and count the respondents who participated in those sessions.

1. **Calculate Average 'Assessment' Score for Each Session Name:**

- **IV (VT):** Respondent 20 (Assessment: 3), Respondent 22 (Assessment: 2). Average = (3 + 2) / 2 = 2.5
- **MI:** Respondent 2 (Assessment: 3). Average = 3
- **III - Sepsis:** Respondent 15 (Assessment: 2). Average = 2
- **II-Anaphylaxsis:** Respondent 23 (Assessment: 3). Average = 3
- **III (Sepsis):** Respondent 8 (Assessment: 2). Average = 2
- **I - MI:** Respondent 19 (Assessment: 2). Average = 2
- **I-VF:** Respondent 13 (Assessment: 2). Average = 2

2. **Identify Sessions with Average 'Assessment' Greater Than 2.0:**

- **IV (VT):** Average = 2.5
- **MI:** Average = 3
- **II-Anaphylaxsis:** Average = 3

3. **Count Respondents in Identified Sessions:**

- **IV (VT):** Respondent 20, Respondent 22 (2 respondents)
- **MI:** Respondent 2 (1 respondent)
- **II-Anaphylaxsis:** Respondent 23 (1 respondent)

Total respondents = 2 (from IV (VT)) + 1 (from MI) + 1 (from II-Anaphylaxsis) = 4

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score across all rubric items is below the average total score for all sessions.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the total score for each respondent across all rubric items, then find the average total score for all sessions, and finally count the respondents whose total score is below this average.

The rubric items are:
- **Identification**
- **Situation**
- **Background (history)**
- **Background (examination)**
- **Assessment**
- **Recommendation (clear recommendation)**
- **Recommendation (global rating scale)**

Each of these items is scored on a scale of 0 to 3.

Let's calculate the total score for each respondent:

1. **Respondent 8**: 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 18
2. **Respondent 18**: 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 2 = 17
3. **Respondent 7**: 3 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 17
4. **Respondent 2**: 3 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 17
5. **Respondent 5**: 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 3 = 20
6. **Respondent 17**: 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 = 20
7. **Respondent 10**: 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 14
8. **Respondent 23**: 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 19
9. **Respondent 14**: 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 2 = 16
10. **Respondent 12**: 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 3 = 20
11. **Respondent 22**: 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 19

Now, let's calculate the average total score:
Total sum = 18 + 17 + 17 + 17 + 20 + 20 + 14 + 19 + 16 + 20 + 19 = 187
Number of respondents = 11
Average total score = Total sum / Number of respondents = 187 / 11 = 17

Next, we count the respondents whose total score is below the average (17):
- **Respondent 18** (17) is exactly at the average, so we do not count.
- **Respondent 7** (17) is exactly at the average, so we do not count.
- **Respondent 2** (17) is exactly at the average, so we do not count.
- **Respondent 10** (14) is below the average.
- **Respondent 14** (16) is below the average.
- **Respondent 18** (17), **Respondent 7** (17), and **Respondent 2** (17) are not below the average since they are exactly at it.

Therefore, the respondents whose total score is below the average are **Respondent 10** and **Respondent 14**.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$",True
case_48,respondent_count,Count the respondents whose 'Assessment' is higher than the average 'Assessment' for all sessions on the same date.,"# Survey Data

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose 'Assessment' is higher than the average 'Assessment' for all sessions on the same date.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Assessment' score for each date, and then compare each respondent's 'Assessment' score to this average for their respective date.

Given data:

- Respondent 19: Date = 2025-05-16, Assessment = 2
- Respondent 20: Date = 2025-05-02, Assessment = 3
- Respondent 11: Date = 2025-04-04, Assessment = 3
- Respondent 8: Date = 2025-05-02, Assessment = 2
- Respondent 10: Date = 2025-03-14, Assessment = 2
- Respondent 5: Date = 2025-05-04, Assessment = 3
- Respondent 17: Date = 2025-05-04, Assessment = 3
- Respondent 22: Date = 2025-05-16, Assessment = 2
- Respondent 7: Date = 2025-03-14, Assessment = 2
- Respondent 18: Date = 2025-05-04, Assessment = 3

### Step 1: Calculate average 'Assessment' for each date

- For 2025-05-16: (2 + 2) / 2 = 2
- For 2025-05-02: (3 + 2) / 2 = 2.5
- For 2025-04-04: (3) / 1 = 3
- For 2025-03-14: (2 + 2) / 2 = 2
- For 2025-05-04: (3 + 3 + 3) / 3 = 3

### Step 2: Identify respondents with 'Assessment' higher than the average for their date

- For 2025-05-16: None (both scores are exactly 2, which is the average)
- For 2025-05-02: Respondent 20 (Assessment = 3, which is higher than 2.5)
- For 2025-04-04: Respondent 11 (Assessment = 3, which is the same as the average, so not higher)
- For 2025-03-14: None (both scores are exactly 2, which is the average)
- For 2025-05-04: None (all scores are exactly 3, which is the average)

### Step 3: Count these respondents

From the analysis, only Respondent 20 has an 'Assessment' score higher than the average for their respective date.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$",True
case_49,respondent_count,Count the respondents whose 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' score is equal to the average 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' score for all sessions that occurred on the same date.,"# Survey Data

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose 'Background (examination)' is higher than the average 'Background (examination)' for all sessions on the same date.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Background (examination)' score for each date, and then compare each respondent's score to this average to determine if it's higher.

Given data:

- Respondent 17: 2025-05-04, Background (examination) = 3
- Respondent 11: 2025-04-04, Background (examination) = 3
- Respondent 14: 2025-03-14, Background (examination) = 2
- Respondent 21: 2025-05-16, Background (examination) = 1
- Respondent 5: 2025-05-04, Background (examination) = 3
- Respondent 10: 2025-03-14, Background (examination) = 2
- Respondent 13: 2025-03-14, Background (examination) = 1
- Respondent 6: 2025-04-04, Background (examination) = 3
- Respondent 23: 2025-03-14, Background (examination) = 2
- Respondent 9: 2025-05-04, Background (examination) = 2
- Respondent 8: 2025-05-02, Background (examination) = 2

Calculating averages by date:
- 2025-05-04: (3 + 3 + 2) / 3 = 8 / 3 = 2.67
- 2025-04-04: (3 + 3) / 2 = 6 / 2 = 3
- 2025-03-14: (2 + 2 + 1 + 2) / 4 = 7 / 4 = 1.75
- 2025-05-16: (1) / 1 = 1
- 2025-05-02: (2) / 1 = 2

Now, comparing each respondent's 'Background (examination)' score to the average for their respective date:
- Respondent 17 (2025-05-04): 3 > 2.67, Yes
- Respondent 11 (2025-04-04): 3 = 3, No
- Respondent 14 (2025-03-14): 2 > 1.75, Yes
- Respondent 21 (2025-05-16): 1 = 1, No
- Respondent 5 (2025-05-04): 3 > 2.67, Yes
- Respondent 10 (2025-03-14): 2 > 1.75, Yes
- Respondent 13 (2025-03-14): 1 < 1.75, No
- Respondent 6 (2025-04-04): 3 = 3, No
- Respondent 23 (2025-03-14): 2 > 1.75, Yes
- Respondent 9 (2025-05-04): 2 < 2.67, No
- Respondent 8 (2025-05-02): 2 = 2, No

Counting respondents with scores higher than the average for their date: 4 (Respondents 17, 14, 5, 10, 23).

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$",True
