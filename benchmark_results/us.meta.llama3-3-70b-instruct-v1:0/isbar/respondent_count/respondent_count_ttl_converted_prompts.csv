</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who scored 3 on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)'.
</task>","To answer this question, we need to examine the 'responses' section of the data and count how many respondents scored a ""3"" on the 'Recommendation_clear_recommendation' field, which corresponds to 'Makes a clear recommendation' with the specific rubric ""3 = Clear comprehensive recommendation without questioning"".

From the provided data:

- Respondent8 scored ""2"" on 'Recommendation_clear_recommendation'.
- Respondent2 scored ""2"" on 'Recommendation_clear_recommendation'.
- Respondent17 scored ""3"" on 'Recommendation_clear_recommendation'.
- Respondent23 scored ""3"" on 'Recommendation_clear_recommendation'.
- Respondent20 scored ""2"" on 'Recommendation_clear_recommendation'.
- Respondent22 scored ""2"" on 'Recommendation_clear_recommendation'.
- Respondent4 scored ""2"" on 'Recommendation_clear_recommendation'.
- Respondent14 scored ""1"" on 'Recommendation_clear_recommendation'.

Therefore, the respondents who scored ""3"" on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' are Respondent17 and Respondent23.

The final answer is: 2",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 'Background (history)' is greater than 5.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to analyze the 'responses' section of the provided data and calculate the total score for 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 'Background (history)' for each respondent. 

According to the 'questions' section, 
- 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is represented by :QRecommendation_global_rating_scale and has a rubric where the scores range from 0 to 3.
- 'Background (history)' is represented by :QBackground_history and also has a rubric where the scores range from 0 to 3.

We then need to count the respondents whose total score for these two categories is greater than 5.

Let's calculate the total score for each respondent:

1. Respondent14: 
   - Recommendation_global_rating_scale: 2
   - Background_history: 2
   Total score: 2 + 2 = 4

2. Respondent6: 
   - Recommendation_global_rating_scale: 3
   - Background_history: 3
   Total score: 3 + 3 = 6

3. Respondent2: 
   - Recommendation_global_rating_scale: 1
   - Background_history: 2
   Total score: 1 + 2 = 3

4. Respondent13: 
   - Recommendation_global_rating_scale: 2
   - Background_history: 2
   Total score: 2 + 2 = 4

5. Respondent16: 
   - Recommendation_global_rating_scale: 3
   - Background_history: 3
   Total score: 3 + 3 = 6

6. Respondent22: 
   - Recommendation_global_rating_scale: 3
   - Background_history: 3
   Total score: 3 + 3 = 6

7. Respondent10: 
   - Recommendation_global_rating_scale: 2
   - Background_history: 2
   Total score: 2 + 2 = 4

From the calculations, the respondents with a total score greater than 5 are:
- Respondent6
- Respondent16
- Respondent22

There are 3 respondents whose total score for 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 'Background (history)' is greater than 5.

The final answer is: 3",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Background (history)' and 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is greater than 3.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the relevant fields: 'Background (history)' and 'Recommendation (global rating scale)'.
2. Map these fields to their corresponding predicates in the data: `pred:Background_history` and `pred:Recommendation_global_rating_scale`.
3. For each respondent, calculate the total score for these two fields.
4. Count the respondents whose total score is greater than 3.

Let's calculate the total scores:

- Respondent1: `pred:Background_history` = 2, `pred:Recommendation_global_rating_scale` = 2, Total = 4
- Respondent10: `pred:Background_history` = 2, `pred:Recommendation_global_rating_scale` = 2, Total = 4
- Respondent19: `pred:Background_history` = 3, `pred:Recommendation_global_rating_scale` = 3, Total = 6
- Respondent20: `pred:Background_history` = 2, `pred:Recommendation_global_rating_scale` = 3, Total = 5
- Respondent4: `pred:Background_history` = 3, `pred:Recommendation_global_rating_scale` = 2, Total = 5

Now, let's count the respondents whose total score is greater than 3:

- Respondent1: Total = 4 (greater than 3)
- Respondent10: Total = 4 (greater than 3)
- Respondent19: Total = 6 (greater than 3)
- Respondent20: Total = 5 (greater than 3)
- Respondent4: Total = 5 (greater than 3)

All 5 respondents have a total score greater than 3.

The final answer is: 5",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who scored 2 on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and whose 'Comments' contain the word 'communication'.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to analyze the 'responses' section of the provided data and identify respondents who meet two conditions:

1. They scored 2 on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)'.
2. Their 'Comments' contain the word 'communication'.

From the provided data, we can see that the 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is actually referred to as 'Recommendation_global_rating_scale' in the responses, and it is scored based on a rubric provided in the 'questions' section. The comments are found under the 'Comments' predicate.

Let's examine each respondent:

- Respondent10: Scored 2 on 'Recommendation_global_rating_scale', but comments do not contain 'communication'.
- Respondent15: Scored 2 on 'Recommendation_global_rating_scale', and comments contain 'communication' (""Detailed Response - clear communication"").
- Respondent21: Scored 3 on 'Recommendation_global_rating_scale', so does not meet the first condition.
- Respondent18: Scored 2 on 'Recommendation_global_rating_scale', and comments contain 'communication' (""Not very concise or clear communication"").
- Respondent17: Scored 2 on 'Recommendation_global_rating_scale', but comments do not contain 'communication'.
- Respondent16: Scored 3 on 'Recommendation_global_rating_scale', so does not meet the first condition.
- Respondent5: Scored 3 on 'Recommendation_global_rating_scale', so does not meet the first condition.
- Respondent22: Scored 3 on 'Recommendation_global_rating_scale', so does not meet the first condition.
- Respondent19: Scored 3 on 'Recommendation_global_rating_scale', so does not meet the first condition.
- Respondent4: Scored 2 on 'Recommendation_global_rating_scale', and comments contain 'communication' (""Clinical handover and communication skills, satisfactory"").

Therefore, the respondents who scored 2 on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and whose 'Comments' contain the word 'communication' are Respondent15, Respondent18, and Respondent4.

The final answer is: 3",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Identification' and 'Assessment' is greater than 6.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to calculate the total score for 'Identification' and 'Assessment' for each respondent and then count the number of respondents whose total score is greater than 6.

Based on the provided data:

- Respondent11: Identification = 3, Assessment = 3, Total = 6
- Respondent6: Identification = 3, Assessment = 2, Total = 5
- Respondent15: Identification = 3, Assessment = 2, Total = 5
- Respondent9: Identification = 3, Assessment = 2, Total = 5
- Respondent22: Identification = 3, Assessment = 2, Total = 5
- Respondent1: Identification = -1, Assessment = 3, Total = 2
- Respondent23: Identification = 3, Assessment = 3, Total = 6
- Respondent10: Identification = 2, Assessment = 2, Total = 4

Only none of the respondents have a total score greater than 6.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Assessment' and 'Identification' is greater than 6.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to analyze the 'responses' section of the provided data and calculate the total score for 'Assessment' and 'Identification' for each respondent. We then count the number of respondents whose total score for these two categories is greater than 6.

Based on the 'questions' section, the scores for 'Assessment' and 'Identification' are as follows:
- 'Assessment' is scored from 0 to 3.
- 'Identification' is scored from 0 to 3.

We will go through each respondent's data, calculate the total score for 'Assessment' and 'Identification', and count those with a total score greater than 6.

1. Respondent20: Assessment = 3, Identification = 3, Total = 6 (Not greater than 6)
2. Respondent8: Assessment = 2, Identification = 3, Total = 5 (Not greater than 6)
3. Respondent22: Assessment = 2, Identification = 3, Total = 5 (Not greater than 6)
4. Respondent5: Assessment = 3, Identification = 3, Total = 6 (Not greater than 6)
5. Respondent16: Assessment = 3, Identification = 3, Total = 6 (Not greater than 6)
6. Respondent23: Assessment = 3, Identification = 3, Total = 6 (Not greater than 6)
7. Respondent15: Assessment = 2, Identification = 3, Total = 5 (Not greater than 6)
8. Respondent12: Assessment = 2, Identification = 3, Total = 5 (Not greater than 6)
9. Respondent7: Assessment = 2, Identification = 3, Total = 5 (Not greater than 6)
10. Respondent19: Assessment = 2, Identification = 3, Total = 5 (Not greater than 6)

None of the respondents have a total score for 'Assessment' and 'Identification' greater than 6. 

The final answer is: 0",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Identification' and 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is greater than 5.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to calculate the total score for 'Identification' and 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' for each respondent and then count the number of respondents whose total score is greater than 5.

Based on the provided data, we can calculate the total score as follows:

- Respondent16: Identification (3) + Recommendation_global_rating_scale (3) = 6
- Respondent18: Identification (3) + Recommendation_global_rating_scale (2) = 5
- Respondent7: Identification (3) + Recommendation_global_rating_scale (2) = 5
- Respondent8: Identification (3) + Recommendation_global_rating_scale (3) = 6
- Respondent3: Identification (0) + Recommendation_global_rating_scale (3) = 3
- Respondent17: Identification (3) + Recommendation_global_rating_scale (2) = 5
- Respondent15: Identification (3) + Recommendation_global_rating_scale (2) = 5
- Respondent12: Identification (3) + Recommendation_global_rating_scale (3) = 6
- Respondent2: Identification (3) + Recommendation_global_rating_scale (1) = 4
- Respondent10: Identification (2) + Recommendation_global_rating_scale (2) = 4
- Respondent22: Identification (3) + Recommendation_global_rating_scale (3) = 6
- Respondent1: Identification (-1) + Recommendation_global_rating_scale (2) = 1

Now, let's count the respondents whose total score is greater than 5:
- Respondent16: 6 (greater than 5)
- Respondent8: 6 (greater than 5)
- Respondent12: 6 (greater than 5)
- Respondent22: 6 (greater than 5)

There are 4 respondents whose total score for 'Identification' and 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is greater than 5, and 2 respondents whose total score is exactly 5, and 6 respondents whose total score is less than or equal to 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

Count the respondents who scored 3 on 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and whose 'Comments' contain the word 'Overall'.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Situation' and 'Background (history)' is greater than 3.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to analyze the 'responses' section of the provided data and calculate the total score for 'Situation' and 'Background (history)' for each respondent. 

According to the 'questions' section, 'Situation' is represented by :QSituation and 'Background (history)' is represented by :QBackground_history. 

We will iterate through each respondent and add their scores for 'Situation' and 'Background (history)'. If the total score is greater than 3, we will count that respondent.

Here are the calculations:

- Respondent22: Situation = 3, Background_history = 3, Total = 6 (counted)
- Respondent10: Situation = 2, Background_history = 2, Total = 4 (counted)
- Respondent1: Situation = 2, Background_history = 2, Total = 4 (counted)
- Respondent13: Situation = 3, Background_history = 2, Total = 5 (counted)
- Respondent9: Situation = 3, Background_history = 2, Total = 5 (counted)
- Respondent21: Situation = 2, Background_history = 3, Total = 5 (counted)
- Respondent7: Situation = 3, Background_history = 2, Total = 5 (counted)
- Respondent3: Situation = 2, Background_history = 3, Total = 5 (counted)
- Respondent18: Situation = 3, Background_history = 2, Total = 5 (counted)
- Respondent17: Situation = 3, Background_history = 3, Total = 6 (counted)
- Respondent6: Situation = 2, Background_history = 3, Total = 5 (counted)

All respondents have a total score greater than 3, so all of them are counted.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose 'Identification' is higher than the average 'Identification' for all sessions on the same date.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Identification' score for each date, and then count the respondents whose 'Identification' score is higher than this average for their respective dates.

Given data:

- Respondent18: Date = ""2025-05-04"", Identification = ""3""
- Respondent2: Date = ""2025-04-04"", Identification = ""3""
- Respondent3: Date = ""2025-04-04"", Identification = ""0""
- Respondent16: Date = ""2025-05-02"", Identification = ""3""
- Respondent22: Date = ""2025-05-16"", Identification = ""3""
- Respondent10: Date = ""2025-03-14"", Identification = ""2""
- Respondent14: Date = ""2025-03-14"", Identification = ""3""
- Respondent6: Date = ""2025-04-04"", Identification = ""3""

Step 1: Calculate the average 'Identification' score for each date.

- For ""2025-05-04"": Average = 3 (only one respondent)
- For ""2025-04-04"": Average = (3 + 0 + 3) / 3 = 6 / 3 = 2
- For ""2025-05-02"": Average = 3 (only one respondent)
- For ""2025-05-16"": Average = 3 (only one respondent)
- For ""2025-03-14"": Average = (2 + 3) / 2 = 5 / 2 = 2.5

Step 2: Identify respondents with 'Identification' higher than the average for their date.

- For ""2025-05-04"": Respondent18's score (3) is equal to the average, so 0 respondents are higher.
- For ""2025-04-04"": Respondent2 and Respondent6 have scores (3) higher than the average (2), and Respondent3's score (0) is lower. So, 2 respondents are higher.
- For ""2025-05-02"": Respondent16's score (3) is equal to the average, so 0 respondents are higher.
- For ""2025-05-16"": Respondent22's score (3) is equal to the average, so 0 respondents are higher.
- For ""2025-03-14"": Respondent14's score (3) is higher than the average (2.5), and Respondent10's score (2) is lower. So, 1 respondent is higher.

Counting these, we have 2 (from ""2025-04-04"") + 1 (from ""2025-03-14"") = 3 respondents whose 'Identification' is higher than the average 'Identification' for all sessions on the same date.

The final answer is: 3",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score across all rubric items is below the average total score for all sessions.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the total score for each respondent across all rubric items, then find the average total score for all sessions, and finally count the respondents whose total score is below this average.

The rubric items are:
- Identification
- Situation
- Background_history
- Background_examination
- Assessment
- Recommendation_clear_recommendation
- Recommendation_global_rating_scale

Each of these items has a score from 0 to 3.

Let's calculate the total score for each respondent:

1. Respondent21: 3 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 3 = 17
2. Respondent23: 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 19
3. Respondent14: 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 2 = 16
4. Respondent12: 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 3 = 20
5. Respondent13: 3 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 15
6. Respondent15: 3 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 17
7. Respondent19: 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 3 = 20
8. Respondent17: 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 = 20
9. Respondent2: 3 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 17

Now, let's calculate the average total score:
Total sum = 17 + 19 + 16 + 20 + 15 + 17 + 20 + 20 + 17 = 161
Number of respondents = 9
Average total score = Total sum / Number of respondents = 161 / 9 = 17.89

We need to count the respondents whose total score is below 17.89:
- Respondent14 (score 16) is below the average.
- Respondent13 (score 15) is below the average.
- Respondent21 (score 17), Respondent15 (score 17), and Respondent2 (score 17) are also below the average since their scores are less than 17.89.

Therefore, the number of respondents whose total score is below the average is 5.",True
case_43,respondent_count,Count the respondents whose 'Background (examination)' score is equal to the average 'Background (examination)' score for all sessions that occurred on the same date.,"@prefix : <http://example.org/survey#> .

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose 'Background (examination)' score is equal to the average 'Background (examination)' score for all sessions that occurred on the same date.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Background (examination)' score for each date, and then count the respondents whose 'Background (examination)' score matches this average for their respective session dates.

1. **Calculate Average 'Background (examination)' Score by Date:**

Looking at the data, the dates mentioned are: '2025-05-04', '2025-05-16', '2025-05-02', '2025-04-04', and '2025-03-14'.

- For '2025-05-04':
  - Respondent5: 3
  - Respondent18: 2
  - Respondent17: 3
  - Average = (3 + 2 + 3) / 3 = 8 / 3 = 2.67

- For '2025-05-16':
  - Respondent21: 1
  - Respondent4: 2
  - Respondent22: 3
  - Average = (1 + 2 + 3) / 3 = 6 / 3 = 2

- For '2025-05-02':
  - Respondent12: 3
  - Respondent20: -1
  - Respondent1: 2
  - Average = (3 - 1 + 2) / 3 = 4 / 3 = 1.33

- For '2025-04-04':
  - Respondent6: 3
  - Average = 3 (since there's only one respondent for this date)

- For '2025-03-14':
  - Respondent13: 1
  - Respondent23: 2
  - Average = (1 + 2) / 2 = 3 / 2 = 1.5

2. **Count Respondents with Matching Average Score:**

- For '2025-05-04', average score is 2.67. No respondent has this exact score, so 0 respondents match.
- For '2025-05-16', average score is 2. Respondent4 has a score of 2, so 1 respondent matches.
- For '2025-05-02', average score is 1.33. No respondent has this exact score, so 0 respondents match.
- For '2025-04-04', average score is 3. Respondent6 has a score of 3, so 1 respondent matches.
- For '2025-03-14', average score is 1.5. No respondent has this exact score, so 0 respondents match.

**Total Count of Respondents with Matching Average Score:** 1 (Respondent4) + 1 (Respondent6) = 2

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who participated in a session where the average 'Assessment' for that session name is greater than 1.5.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Assessment' score for each session name. Then, we identify the sessions with an average 'Assessment' score greater than 1.5 and count the respondents who participated in those sessions.

Given the data, let's calculate the average 'Assessment' score for each session name:

1. **III (Sepsis)**: Respondent8 (2), Respondent15 (2) => Average = (2 + 2) / 2 = 2
2. **IV (VT)**: Respondent18 (3), Respondent22 (2) => Average = (3 + 2) / 2 = 2.5
3. **IV-Hypoglycemia**: Respondent14 (3) => Average = 3 (since there's only one respondent)
4. **I (Myocardial infarction)**: Respondent21 (2) => Average = 2 (since there's only one respondent)
5. **I-VF**: Respondent13 (2) => Average = 2 (since there's only one respondent)
6. **V (Hypoglycemia)**: Respondent17 (3) => Average = 3 (since there's only one respondent)
7. **I - MI**: Respondent16 (3) => Average = 3 (since there's only one respondent)
8. **II (Anaphylactic Shock)**: Respondent6 (2) => Average = 2 (since there's only one respondent)

Sessions with an average 'Assessment' score greater than 1.5 are:
- **IV (VT)** with an average of 2.5
- **IV-Hypoglycemia** with an average of 3
- **V (Hypoglycemia)** with an average of 3
- **I - MI** with an average of 3
- **III (Sepsis)** with an average of 2
- **I (Myocardial infarction)** with an average of 2
- **I-VF** with an average of 2
- **II (Anaphylactic Shock)** with an average of 2

However, for the purpose of this task, we only consider sessions with an average greater than 1.5, which means all the listed sessions qualify since their averages are either 2 or 3, both of which are greater than 1.5.

Now, let's count the respondents in these sessions:
- **IV (VT)**: Respondent18, Respondent22 (2 respondents)
- **IV-Hypoglycemia**: Respondent14 (1 respondent)
- **V (Hypoglycemia)**: Respondent17 (1 respondent)
- **I - MI**: Respondent16 (1 respondent)
- **III (Sepsis)**: Respondent8, Respondent15 (2 respondents)
- **I (Myocardial infarction)**: Respondent21 (1 respondent)
- **I-VF**: Respondent13 (1 respondent)
- **II (Anaphylactic Shock)**: Respondent6 (1 respondent)

Total respondents = 2 (IV) + 1 (IV-Hypoglycemia) + 1 (V) + 1 (I - MI) + 2 (III) + 1 (I) + 1 (I-VF) + 1 (II) = 10

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose 'Background (examination)' is higher than the average 'Background (examination)' for all sessions on the same date.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Background (examination)' score for all sessions on each date, and then count the respondents whose 'Background (examination)' score is higher than this average for their respective session dates.

Given the data, let's calculate the average 'Background (examination)' score for each date:

1. **2025-05-02**:
   - Respondent1: 2
   - Respondent8: 2
   - Respondent20: -1
   Average = (2 + 2 - 1) / 3 = 3 / 3 = 1

2. **2025-05-04**:
   - Respondent9: 2
   Average = 2

3. **2025-05-16**:
   - Respondent4: 2
   - Respondent22: 3
   Average = (2 + 3) / 2 = 5 / 2 = 2.5

4. **2025-03-14**:
   - Respondent7: 3
   - Respondent14: 2
   Average = (3 + 2) / 2 = 5 / 2 = 2.5

5. **2025-04-04**:
   - Respondent2: 3
   Average = 3

Now, let's identify respondents whose 'Background (examination)' score is higher than the average for their session date:

1. **2025-05-02**: Average is 1. None of the respondents have a score higher than 1 on this date (Respondent1 and Respondent8 have a score of 2, which is higher, but Respondent20 has a score of -1, making the average 1. However, given the context, it seems there might have been an oversight in calculating the average with a negative score included. Normally, averages are calculated with all values being positive or zero, as negative scores might indicate missing or invalid data. If we exclude the -1, assuming it might be an error or not applicable, the average for Respondent1 and Respondent8 would be (2+2)/2 = 2, and both would be exactly at the average, not higher).

2. **2025-05-04**: Respondent9's score is exactly the average, so there are no respondents higher than the average on this date.

3. **2025-05-16**: Respondent22's score (3) is higher than the average (2.5).

4. **2025-03-14**: Respondent7's score (3) is higher than the average (2.5).

5. **2025-04-04**: Respondent2's score is exactly the average, so there are no respondents higher than the average on this date.

Thus, the respondents whose 'Background (examination)' score is higher than the average for their respective session dates are:

- Respondent22 (2025-05-16)
- Respondent7 (2025-03-14)

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who participated in a session where the average 'Assessment' for that session name is greater than 2.0.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Assessment' score for each session name, and then count the respondents who participated in sessions where this average is greater than 2.0.

Given the data:

1. **Respondent20**: SessionName ""IV (VT)"", Assessment ""3""
2. **Respondent2**: SessionName ""MI"", Assessment ""3""
3. **Respondent15**: SessionName ""III - Sepsis"", Assessment ""2""
4. **Respondent23**: SessionName ""II-Anaphylaxsis"", Assessment ""3""
5. **Respondent22**: SessionName ""IV (VT)"", Assessment ""2""
6. **Respondent8**: SessionName ""III (Sepsis)"", Assessment ""2""
7. **Respondent19**: SessionName ""I - MI"", Assessment ""2""
8. **Respondent13**: SessionName ""I-VF"", Assessment ""2""

First, calculate the average Assessment score for each unique SessionName:

- **IV (VT)**: (3 + 2) / 2 = 2.5
- **MI**: 3 / 1 = 3
- **III - Sepsis**: (2 + 2) / 2 = 2
- **II-Anaphylaxsis**: 3 / 1 = 3
- **I - MI**: 2 / 1 = 2
- **I-VF**: 2 / 1 = 2

Then, identify the sessions with an average Assessment score greater than 2.0:

- **IV (VT)**: 2.5
- **MI**: 3
- **II-Anaphylaxsis**: 3

Now, count the respondents who participated in these sessions:

- **Respondent20** (IV (VT))
- **Respondent22** (IV (VT))
- **Respondent2** (MI)
- **Respondent23** (II-Anaphylaxsis)

There are 4 respondents who participated in sessions where the average 'Assessment' score is greater than 2.0.

Answer: 4",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score across all rubric items is below the average total score for all sessions.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the total score for each respondent across all rubric items, then find the average total score for all sessions, and finally count the respondents whose total score is below this average.

The rubric items are:
- Identification
- Situation
- Background_history
- Background_examination
- Assessment
- Recommendation_clear_recommendation
- Recommendation_global_rating_scale

Each of these items has a score from 0 to 3.

Let's calculate the total score for each respondent:

1. Respondent8: 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 18
2. Respondent18: 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 2 = 17
3. Respondent7: 3 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 17
4. Respondent2: 3 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 17
5. Respondent5: 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 3 = 20
6. Respondent17: 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 = 20
7. Respondent10: 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 14
8. Respondent23: 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 19
9. Respondent14: 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 2 = 16
10. Respondent12: 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 3 = 20
11. Respondent22: 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 19

Now, let's calculate the average total score:
Total sum = 18 + 17 + 17 + 17 + 20 + 20 + 14 + 19 + 16 + 20 + 19 = 187
Number of respondents = 11
Average total score = Total sum / Number of respondents = 187 / 11 = 17

Next, we count the respondents whose total score is below the average (17):
- Respondent18 (17) is exactly at the average, so we do not count.
- Respondent7 (17) is exactly at the average, so we do not count.
- Respondent2 (17) is exactly at the average, so we do not count.
- Respondent10 (14) is below the average.
- Respondent14 (16) is below the average.
- Respondent18, Respondent7, and Respondent2 are not below the average since their scores are exactly 17, which is the average.

Therefore, the number of respondents whose total score is below the average total score for all sessions is 2.",True
case_48,respondent_count,Count the respondents whose 'Assessment' is higher than the average 'Assessment' for all sessions on the same date.,"@prefix : <http://example.org/survey#> .

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose 'Assessment' is higher than the average 'Assessment' for all sessions on the same date.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Assessment' score for each date, and then count the respondents whose 'Assessment' score is higher than the average 'Assessment' score for their respective session dates.

1. **Calculate Average 'Assessment' Score by Date:**

- For ""2025-05-02"":
  - Respondent20: Assessment = ""3""
  - Respondent8: Assessment = ""2""
  - Average = (3 + 2) / 2 = 2.5

- For ""2025-04-04"":
  - Respondent11: Assessment = ""3""
  - Average = 3

- For ""2025-03-14"":
  - Respondent10: Assessment = ""2""
  - Respondent7: Assessment = ""2""
  - Average = (2 + 2) / 2 = 2

- For ""2025-05-04"":
  - Respondent5: Assessment = ""3""
  - Respondent17: Assessment = ""3""
  - Respondent18: Assessment = ""3""
  - Average = (3 + 3 + 3) / 3 = 3

- For ""2025-05-16"":
  - Respondent19: Assessment = ""2""
  - Respondent22: Assessment = ""2""
  - Average = (2 + 2) / 2 = 2

2. **Count Respondents with 'Assessment' Higher than Average for Their Date:**

- For ""2025-05-02"":
  - Respondent20: Assessment = ""3"" > 2.5, so count = 1
  - Respondent8: Assessment = ""2"" < 2.5, so not counted

- For ""2025-04-04"":
  - Respondent11: Assessment = ""3"" = 3, so not higher, not counted

- For ""2025-03-14"":
  - Respondent10: Assessment = ""2"" = 2, so not higher, not counted
  - Respondent7: Assessment = ""2"" = 2, so not higher, not counted

- For ""2025-05-04"":
  - All respondents have an Assessment of ""3"", which equals the average, so none are counted.

- For ""2025-05-16"":
  - Neither Respondent19 nor Respondent22 has an Assessment higher than the average, so none are counted.

**Total Count:** 1

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$",True
case_49,respondent_count,Count the respondents whose 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' score is equal to the average 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' score for all sessions that occurred on the same date.,"@prefix : <http://example.org/survey#> .

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' score is equal to the average 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' score for all sessions that occurred on the same date.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' score for each date, and then count the respondents whose score matches this average for their respective session dates.

Given the data, let's calculate the average 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' score for each date:

1. **2025-04-04**:
   - Respondent2: 2
   - Respondent6: 2
   - Respondent11: 3
   Average = (2 + 2 + 3) / 3 = 7 / 3 = 2.33

2. **2025-05-02**:
   - Respondent16: 2
   - Respondent20: 2
   Average = (2 + 2) / 2 = 4 / 2 = 2

3. **2025-05-04**:
   - Respondent18: 2
   Average = 2

4. **2025-05-16**:
   - Respondent19: 3
   - Respondent22: 2
   Average = (3 + 2) / 2 = 5 / 2 = 2.5

5. **2025-03-14**:
   - Respondent14: 1
   - Respondent23: 3
   Average = (1 + 3) / 2 = 4 / 2 = 2

Now, let's identify the respondents whose 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' score equals the average for their session date:

1. **2025-04-04**: None of the respondents have a score of 2.33.
2. **2025-05-02**: Both Respondent16 and Respondent20 have a score of 2, which matches the average.
3. **2025-05-04**: Respondent18 has a score of 2, which matches the average.
4. **2025-05-16**: None of the respondents have a score of 2.5.
5. **2025-03-14**: None of the respondents have a score of 2.

Counting these respondents:
- Respondent16
- Respondent20
- Respondent18

There are **3** respondents whose 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' score equals the average for their session date.",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose 'Background (examination)' is higher than the average 'Background (examination)' for all sessions on the same date.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Background (examination)' score for each date, and then count the respondents whose 'Background (examination)' score is higher than this average for their respective dates.

Given the data, let's calculate the average 'Background (examination)' score for each date and then identify the respondents with scores higher than these averages.

1. **2025-05-04**:
   - Respondent17: 3
   - Respondent5: 3
   - Respondent9: 2
   - Average = (3 + 3 + 2) / 3 = 8 / 3 = 2.67

2. **2025-04-04**:
   - Respondent11: 3
   - Respondent6: 3
   - Average = (3 + 3) / 2 = 6 / 2 = 3

3. **2025-03-14**:
   - Respondent14: 2
   - Respondent10: 2
   - Respondent13: 1
   - Respondent23: 2
   - Average = (2 + 2 + 1 + 2) / 4 = 7 / 4 = 1.75

4. **2025-05-16**:
   - Respondent21: 1
   - Average = 1 (since there's only one respondent for this date)

5. **2025-05-02**:
   - Respondent8: 2
   - Average = 2 (since there's only one respondent for this date)

Now, let's identify the respondents whose 'Background (examination)' score is higher than the average for their respective dates:

- For **2025-05-04**, the average is 2.67. Respondents with scores higher than 2.67 are Respondent17 and Respondent5.
- For **2025-04-04**, the average is 3. No respondents have scores higher than 3.
- For **2025-03-14**, the average is 1.75. Respondents with scores higher than 1.75 are Respondent14, Respondent10, and Respondent23.
- For **2025-05-16**, the average is 1. No respondents have scores higher than 1.
- For **2025-05-02**, the average is 2. No respondents have scores higher than 2.

Counting these respondents:
- Respondent17
- Respondent5
- Respondent14
- Respondent10
- Respondent23

There are **5** respondents whose 'Background (examination)' score is higher than the average for all sessions on the same date.",True
