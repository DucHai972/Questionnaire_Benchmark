<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Background (examination)' and 'Assessment' is greater than 5.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to iterate through each respondent's answers in the 'responses' section and calculate the total score for 'Background (examination)' and 'Assessment'. We then compare this total to 5 and count the respondents where the total is greater than 5.

Given the provided XML data, we can see the scores for 'Background (examination)' and 'Assessment' for each respondent. 

1. Respondent 19: 'Background (examination)' = 3, 'Assessment' = 2, Total = 5
2. Respondent 7: 'Background (examination)' = 3, 'Assessment' = 2, Total = 5
3. Respondent 3: 'Background (examination)' = 3, 'Assessment' = 3, Total = 6
4. Respondent 18: 'Background (examination)' = 2, 'Assessment' = 3, Total = 5
5. Respondent 22: 'Background (examination)' = 3, 'Assessment' = 2, Total = 5
6. Respondent 23: 'Background (examination)' = 2, 'Assessment' = 3, Total = 5
7. Respondent 8: 'Background (examination)' = 2, 'Assessment' = 2, Total = 4

From the calculations above, only Respondent 3 has a total score greater than 5.

The final answer is: 1",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

Count the respondents whose total score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and 'Situation' is greater than 5.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to calculate the total score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and 'Situation' for each respondent and then count the number of respondents whose total score is greater than 5.

Based on the provided data:

- Respondent 5: 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' = 2, 'Situation' = 3, Total = 5
- Respondent 1: 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' = 2, 'Situation' = 2, Total = 4
- Respondent 12: 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' = 3, 'Situation' = 3, Total = 6
- Respondent 8: 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' = 2, 'Situation' = 3, Total = 5
- Respondent 19: 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' = 3, 'Situation' = 3, Total = 6

The respondents with a total score greater than 5 are:
- Respondent 12
- Respondent 19

Therefore, the number of respondents whose total score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and 'Situation' is greater than 5 is 2.",True

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and 'Background (history)' is greater than 5.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to iterate through each respondent's answers in the 'responses' section and check their scores for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and 'Background (history)'. We then sum these scores and check if the total is greater than 5.

Let's examine the data:

1. Respondent 3: 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' = 3, 'Background (history)' = 3, Total = 6
2. Respondent 23: 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' = 3, 'Background (history)' = 2, Total = 5
3. Respondent 11: 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' = 3, 'Background (history)' = 3, Total = 6
4. Respondent 20: 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' = 2, 'Background (history)' = 2, Total = 4
5. Respondent 5: 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' = 2, 'Background (history)' = 3, Total = 5
6. Respondent 22: 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' = 2, 'Background (history)' = 3, Total = 5
7. Respondent 19: 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' = 3, 'Background (history)' = 3, Total = 6
8. Respondent 9: 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' = 3, 'Background (history)' = 2, Total = 5
9. Respondent 10: 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' = 2, 'Background (history)' = 2, Total = 4
10. Respondent 21: 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' = 3, 'Background (history)' = 3, Total = 6
11. Respondent 15: 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' = 2, 'Background (history)' = 2, Total = 4

From the totals calculated, the respondents with a total score greater than 5 for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and 'Background (history)' are:

- Respondent 3
- Respondent 11
- Respondent 19
- Respondent 21

Therefore, the number of respondents whose total score for these two questions is greater than 5 is 4.",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 'Assessment' is greater than 5.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to calculate the total score for 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 'Assessment' for each respondent and then count the respondents whose total score is greater than 5.

Based on the provided data, we can calculate the total score as follows:

- Respondent 2: 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' = 1, 'Assessment' = 3, Total score = 1 + 3 = 4
- Respondent 10: 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' = 2, 'Assessment' = 2, Total score = 2 + 2 = 4
- Respondent 20: 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' = 3, 'Assessment' = 3, Total score = 3 + 3 = 6
- Respondent 22: 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' = 3, 'Assessment' = 2, Total score = 3 + 2 = 5
- Respondent 12: 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' = 3, 'Assessment' = 2, Total score = 3 + 2 = 5
- Respondent 4: 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' = 2, 'Assessment' = 2, Total score = 2 + 2 = 4
- Respondent 17: 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' = 2, 'Assessment' = 3, Total score = 2 + 3 = 5
- Respondent 7: 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' = 2, 'Assessment' = 2, Total score = 2 + 2 = 4
- Respondent 3: 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' = 3, 'Assessment' = 3, Total score = 3 + 3 = 6
- Respondent 11: 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' = 3, 'Assessment' = 3, Total score = 3 + 3 = 6
- Respondent 8: 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' = 3, 'Assessment' = 2, Total score = 3 + 2 = 5

Now, let's count the respondents whose total score is greater than 5:
- Respondent 20: Total score = 6
- Respondent 3: Total score = 6
- Respondent 11: Total score = 6

There are 3 respondents whose total score is greater than 5, and 4 respondents whose total score is exactly 5. However, the task asks for the count of respondents with a total score greater than 5.

The final answer is: 3",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents who scored 3 on 'Background (examination)' also have 'Comments' that contain the word 'unclear'?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to analyze the 'responses' section of the dataset and find the respondents who scored 3 on 'Background (examination)' and also have 'Comments' that contain the word 'unclear'.

After analyzing the data, we find that:

- Respondent 19 scored 3 on 'Background (examination)' and has 'Comments' that contain the word 'unclear' (""Clarity is a bit low over whole case scenario"" does not exactly contain ""unclear"" but respondent 9 scored 2 on 'Background (examination)' and has 'Comments' that contain the word 'unclear' (""Overall a bit unclear communication reflected"")).
- Respondent 5 scored 3 on 'Background (examination)' but does not have 'Comments' that contain the word 'unclear'.
- Respondent 6 scored 3 on 'Background (examination)' but does not have 'Comments' that contain the word 'unclear'.
- Respondent 12 scored 3 on 'Background (examination)' but does not have 'Comments' that contain the word 'unclear'.
- Respondent 15 scored 3 on 'Background (examination)' but does not have 'Comments' that contain the word 'unclear'.

However, none of the respondents who scored 3 on 'Background (examination)' have 'Comments' that exactly contain the word 'unclear', except for none. 

The final answer is: 0",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who participated in a session where the average 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' for that session name is greater than 2.5.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' for each session name, and then count the respondents who participated in sessions where this average is greater than 2.5.

1. **Identify Unique Session Names**: 
   - II (Anaphylaxis)
   - V (Hypoglycemia)
   - II (Anaphylactic Shock)
   - II - Anaphylaxsis
   - I - MI
   - I-VF
   - III-Sepsis
   - IV (VT)
   - II-Anaphylaxsis
   - IV (AF)

2. **Calculate Average 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' for Each Session**:
   - For II (Anaphylaxis): Respondent 12 has a score of 3. 
   - For V (Hypoglycemia): Respondent 1 has a score of 2.
   - For II (Anaphylactic Shock): Respondent 6 has a score of 3.
   - For II - Anaphylaxsis: Respondent 5 has a score of 3.
   - For I - MI: Respondent 19 has a score of 3.
   - For I-VF: Respondent 13 has a score of 2.
   - For III-Sepsis: Respondent 3 has a score of 3.
   - For IV (VT): Respondent 20 has a score of 3.
   - For II-Anaphylaxsis: Respondent 23 has a score of 3.
   - For IV (AF): Respondent 11 has a score of 3.

3. **Identify Sessions with Average > 2.5**:
   - Since each session has only one respondent, the average for each session is the score of its respondent. Sessions with scores > 2.5 are:
     - II (Anaphylaxis)
     - II (Anaphylactic Shock)
     - II - Anaphylaxsis
     - I - MI
     - III-Sepsis
     - IV (VT)
     - II-Anaphylaxsis
     - IV (AF)

4. **Count Respondents in These Sessions**:
   - Respondent 12 (II (Anaphylaxis))
   - Respondent 6 (II (Anaphylactic Shock))
   - Respondent 5 (II - Anaphylaxsis)
   - Respondent 19 (I - MI)
   - Respondent 3 (III-Sepsis)
   - Respondent 20 (IV (VT))
   - Respondent 23 (II-Anaphylaxsis)
   - Respondent 11 (IV (AF))

There are 8 respondents who participated in sessions where the 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is greater than 2.5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who participated in a session where the average 'Situation' for that session name is greater than 2.0.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Situation' score for each session name, and then count the respondents who participated in sessions where this average is greater than 2.0.

Given the data, let's calculate the average 'Situation' score for each session name:

1. **III-Sepsis**: Respondents 3, 7, and 15 participated in this session.
   - Respondent 3's 'Situation' score: 2
   - Respondent 7's 'Situation' score: 3
   - Respondent 15's 'Situation' score: 3
   - Average 'Situation' score for III-Sepsis: (2 + 3 + 3) / 3 = 8 / 3 = 2.67

2. **V (Hypoglycemia)**: Respondent 17 participated in this session.
   - Respondent 17's 'Situation' score: 3
   - Average 'Situation' score for V (Hypoglycemia): 3

3. **I-VF**: Respondent 13 participated in this session.
   - Respondent 13's 'Situation' score: 3
   - Average 'Situation' score for I-VF: 3

4. **IV-Hypoglycemia**: Respondent 14 participated in this session.
   - Respondent 14's 'Situation' score: 3
   - Average 'Situation' score for IV-Hypoglycemia: 3

5. **IV (AF)**: Respondent 11 participated in this session.
   - Respondent 11's 'Situation' score: 3
   - Average 'Situation' score for IV (AF): 3

6. **II (Anaphylactic Shock)**: Respondent 6 participated in this session.
   - Respondent 6's 'Situation' score: 2
   - Average 'Situation' score for II (Anaphylactic Shock): 2

Sessions with an average 'Situation' score greater than 2.0 are:
- III-Sepsis
- V (Hypoglycemia)
- I-VF
- IV-Hypoglycemia
- IV (AF)

Respondents who participated in these sessions are:
- 3, 7, 15 (III-Sepsis)
- 17 (V (Hypoglycemia))
- 13 (I-VF)
- 14 (IV-Hypoglycemia)
- 11 (IV (AF))

Count of respondents: 3 (from III-Sepsis) + 1 (from V (Hypoglycemia)) + 1 (from I-VF) + 1 (from IV-Hypoglycemia) + 1 (from IV (AF)) = 7

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$",True

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the respondents who participated in a session where the average 'Background (examination)' for that session name is greater than 2.0.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Background (examination)' score for each unique session name. Then, we identify the sessions with an average score greater than 2.0 and count the respondents who participated in those sessions.

Given the data, let's calculate the average 'Background (examination)' score for each session name:

1. (MI)-VT: 2
2. IV (AF): 3
3. I - MI: 3
4. IV (VT): -1
5. III-Sepsis: 3
6. MI: 3
7. II - Anaphylaxsis: 3
8. II (Anaphylactic Shock): 3
9. I-VF: 1
10. II-Anaphylaxsis: 2

Now, let's calculate the average for sessions with more than one respondent (if any) and identify sessions with an average greater than 2.0:

- Sessions with average > 2.0: IV (AF), I - MI, III-Sepsis, MI, II - Anaphylaxsis, II (Anaphylactic Shock)

Counting the respondents for these sessions:

- IV (AF): 1 respondent (ID 11)
- I - MI: 1 respondent (ID 19)
- III-Sepsis: 1 respondent (ID 3)
- MI: 1 respondent (ID 2)
- II - Anaphylaxsis: 1 respondent (ID 5)
- II (Anaphylactic Shock): 1 respondent (ID 6)
- II-Anaphylaxsis does not meet the criteria since its average is exactly 2.0, which is not greater than 2.0.

Therefore, the total number of respondents who participated in sessions with an average 'Background (examination)' score greater than 2.0 is 6.",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who participated in a session where the average 'Assessment' for that session name is greater than 2.5.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Assessment' score for each session name, and then count the respondents who participated in sessions where this average is greater than 2.5.

Given the data, let's calculate the average 'Assessment' score for each session name:

1. **I - MI**: Respondents 16 and 19 participated in this session.
   - Respondent 16's Assessment score: 3
   - Respondent 19's Assessment score: 2
   - Average Assessment score for **I - MI**: (3 + 2) / 2 = 2.5

2. **II (Anaphylaxsis)**: Respondent 9 participated in this session.
   - Respondent 9's Assessment score: 2
   - Average Assessment score for **II (Anaphylaxsis)**: 2

3. **III - Sepsis**: Respondents 3 and 15 participated in this session.
   - Respondent 3's Assessment score: 3
   - Respondent 15's Assessment score: 2
   - Average Assessment score for **III - Sepsis**: (3 + 2) / 2 = 2.5

4. **III-Sepsis**: This seems to be the same as **III - Sepsis**, but let's consider it separately for clarity.
   - Respondent 3's Assessment score: 3
   - Average Assessment score for **III-Sepsis**: 3

5. **IV (VT)**: Respondents 22 and 20 participated in this session.
   - Respondent 22's Assessment score: 2
   - Respondent 20's Assessment score: 3
   - Average Assessment score for **IV (VT)**: (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5

6. **IV-Hypoglycemia**: Respondent 14 participated in this session.
   - Respondent 14's Assessment score: 3
   - Average Assessment score for **IV-Hypoglycemia**: 3

Now, let's identify the sessions with an average 'Assessment' score greater than 2.5:
- **III-Sepsis** (average score: 3)
- **IV-Hypoglycemia** (average score: 3)

Respondents who participated in these sessions:
- Respondent 3 (**III-Sepsis**)
- Respondent 14 (**IV-Hypoglycemia**)

Therefore, the number of respondents who participated in a session where the average 'Assessment' for that session name is greater than 2.5 is 2.",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents whose comments contain 'Good' also have a total score across all rubric items that is below the average total score for all sessions?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the total score for each respondent across all rubric items, then find the average total score for all sessions. After that, we can identify which respondents have comments containing 'Good' and a total score below the average.

1. **Identify Rubric Items and Calculate Total Score for Each Respondent:**
   - The rubric items are: Identification, Situation, Background (history), Background (examination), Assessment, Recommendation (clear recommendation), Recommendation (global rating scale).
   - For each respondent, we sum the scores of these items to get the total score.

2. **Calculate the Average Total Score for All Sessions:**
   - Sum all the total scores of the respondents.
   - Divide by the number of respondents to get the average total score.

3. **Identify Respondents with Comments Containing 'Good' and Total Score Below Average:**
   - For each respondent, check if their comments contain 'Good'.
   - If 'Good' is found, compare their total score to the average total score.
   - Count how many respondents meet both conditions.

Let's apply these steps to the data:

**Step 1: Calculate Total Scores**

- Respondent 7: 3 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 17
- Respondent 17: 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 = 20
- Respondent 4: 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 17
- Respondent 12: 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 3 = 20
- Respondent 14: 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 2 = 16
- Respondent 21: 3 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 3 = 17
- Respondent 10: 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 14
- Respondent 16: 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 3 = 20
- Respondent 9: 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 2 = 17
- Respondent 11: 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 21

**Step 2: Calculate Average Total Score**

- Sum of total scores = 17 + 20 + 17 + 20 + 16 + 17 + 14 + 20 + 17 + 21 = 171
- Number of respondents = 10
- Average total score = 171 / 10 = 17.1

**Step 3: Identify Respondents with 'Good' in Comments and Score Below Average**

- Respondent 12 has 'Good' in comments and a total score of 20, which is above the average.
- Respondent 16 has 'Satisfactory' in comments, not 'Good', and a total score of 20, which is above the average.
- Respondent 21 has 'Good' in comments and a total score of 17, which is below the average.
- Respondent 11 has 'Good' in comments (part of 'Clear communication and handover' is not directly 'Good' but 'Good' is not found; however, 'Clear' might imply a positive but it does not directly match 'Good') and a total score of 21, which is above the average.

Only Respondent 21 meets the condition of having 'Good' in their comments (as part of a broader positive statement) and a total score below the average. However, upon closer inspection, it seems there might have been an oversight in the initial interpretation regarding Respondent 21's comments directly containing 'Good' as a distinct word for evaluation purposes. The task specifically asks for comments containing 'Good', and while Respondent 21's comments are positive, they do not directly contain the word 'Good' as required for the task's conditions.

Upon reevaluation for accuracy and adherence to the task's specifics:

- Respondent 12's comments are 'Good', and their score is 20, which is above the average.
- Respondent 21's comments do not directly contain 'Good' but are positive; their score is 17, which is below the average, but they do not meet the 'Good' comment criterion as directly stated.

Given the strict criteria and upon a detailed review, it appears there was an initial misinterpretation regarding the presence of 'Good' in comments and the comparison to the average score. The correct approach should strictly follow the task's requirements, focusing on comments that explicitly contain 'Good' and scores that are below the calculated average.

**Corrected Analysis:**

Upon a careful review, the initial analysis incorrectly identified respondents based on a broad interpretation of 'Good' in comments. The task requires a precise match of 'Good' in the comments and a total score below the average. 

Given this, let's correctly identify respondents with 'Good' in their comments and a total score below the average of 17.1:

- Respondent 12 has 'Good' in comments but a score of 20, which is above the average.
- Respondent 21 does not have 'Good' directly in comments but has a score of 17, which is below the average, yet does not meet the 'Good' criterion.

Actually, Respondent 12's comment is 'Good', but their score is above average. Respondent 21's comment mentions 'Good and early assessment', which does contain 'Good', and their score is 17, which is below the average of 17.1.

Thus, the correct count based on the precise criteria provided and correcting for the oversight in interpreting comments and scores is:

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who participated in a session where the average 'Situation' for that session name is greater than 2.0.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Situation' score for each unique 'SessionName'. Then, we identify which of these averages are greater than 2.0. Finally, we count how many respondents participated in sessions with those 'SessionName's.

Given the data, let's calculate the average 'Situation' score for each 'SessionName':

1. **MI**: Respondent 2 has a 'Situation' score of 3. (Average = 3)
2. **III (Sepsis)**: Respondents 8, 4 have 'Situation' scores of 3, 3 respectively. (Average = 3)
3. **I-VF**: Respondent 13 has a 'Situation' score of 3. (Average = 3)
4. **IV (VT)**: Respondent 20 has a 'Situation' score of 3. (Average = 3)
5. **II-Anaphylaxsis**: Respondent 23 has a 'Situation' score of 3. (Average = 3)
6. **V (Hypoglycemia)**: Respondent 1 has a 'Situation' score of 2. (Average = 2)
7. **III-Sepsis**: Respondent 7 has a 'Situation' score of 3. (Average = 3)
8. **(MI)-VT**: Respondent 10 has a 'Situation' score of 2. (Average = 2)
9. **I (Myocardial infarction)**: Respondent 21 has a 'Situation' score of 2. (Average = 2)

Session names with an average 'Situation' score greater than 2.0 are:
- **MI**
- **III (Sepsis)**
- **I-VF**
- **IV (VT)**
- **II-Anaphylaxsis**
- **III-Sepsis**

Respondents who participated in these sessions are:
- Respondent 2 (**MI**)
- Respondents 8, 4 (**III (Sepsis)**)
- Respondent 13 (**I-VF**)
- Respondent 20 (**IV (VT)**)
- Respondent 23 (**II-Anaphylaxsis**)
- Respondent 7 (**III-Sepsis**)

Counting these respondents gives us a total of 7 respondents.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents have a 'Identification' score that is higher than the average 'Identification' for all sessions on the same date?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Identification' score for each date, and then compare each respondent's 'Identification' score to the average for their respective date.

1. Calculate the average 'Identification' score for each date:
   - For 2025-05-04, there is 1 respondent with an 'Identification' score of 3. Average = 3.
   - For 2025-03-14, there are 2 respondents with 'Identification' scores of 2 and 3. Average = (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5.
   - For 2025-04-04, there are 3 respondents with 'Identification' scores of 3, 3, and 0. Average = (3 + 3 + 0) / 3 = 2.
   - For 2025-05-02, there are 2 respondents with 'Identification' scores of -1 and 3. Average = (-1 + 3) / 2 = 1.
   - For 2025-05-16, there is 1 respondent with an 'Identification' score of 3. Average = 3.

2. Compare each respondent's 'Identification' score to the average for their date:
   - Respondent 9 (2025-05-04) has a score of 3, which is equal to the average. Not higher.
   - Respondent 10 (2025-03-14) has a score of 2, which is lower than the average of 2.5. Not higher.
   - Respondent 11 (2025-04-04) has a score of 3, which is higher than the average of 2. Higher.
   - Respondent 14 (2025-03-14) has a score of 3, which is higher than the average of 2.5. Higher.
   - Respondent 4 (2025-05-16) has a score of 3, which is equal to the average. Not higher.
   - Respondent 1 (2025-05-02) has a score of -1, which is lower than the average of 1. Not higher.
   - Respondent 16 (2025-05-02) has a score of 3, which is higher than the average of 1. Higher.
   - Respondent 6 (2025-04-04) has a score of 3, which is higher than the average of 2. Higher.
   - Respondent 3 (2025-04-04) has a score of 0, which is lower than the average of 2. Not higher.

3. Count the respondents with 'Identification' scores higher than the average for their date:
   - Respondents 11, 14, 16, and 6 have scores higher than their respective date averages.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents have a 'Background (examination)' score that is higher than the average 'Background (examination)' for all sessions on the same date?
</task>","To solve this, we first need to calculate the average 'Background (examination)' score for each date, and then compare each respondent's score to this average.

1. **Calculate average 'Background (examination)' score for each date:**

- For 2025-05-04: Respondents 18 and 17 have scores of 2 and 3, respectively. Average = (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5
- For 2025-05-02: Respondents 8 and 12 and 1 have scores of 2, 3, and 2, respectively. Average = (2 + 3 + 2) / 3 = 2.33
- For 2025-04-04: Respondents 3 and 2 have scores of 3 and 3, respectively. Average = (3 + 3) / 2 = 3
- For 2025-03-14: Respondents 23, 13, and 7 have scores of 2, 1, and 3, respectively. Average = (2 + 1 + 3) / 3 = 2
- For 2025-05-16: Respondent 22 has a score of 3. Average = 3

2. **Compare each respondent's 'Background (examination)' score to the average for their session date:**

- Respondent 18 (2025-05-04): Score 2, Average 2.5. Not higher.
- Respondent 8 (2025-05-02): Score 2, Average 2.33. Not higher.
- Respondent 17 (2025-05-04): Score 3, Average 2.5. Higher.
- Respondent 23 (2025-03-14): Score 2, Average 2. Not higher.
- Respondent 12 (2025-05-02): Score 3, Average 2.33. Higher.
- Respondent 3 (2025-04-04): Score 3, Average 3. Not higher.
- Respondent 13 (2025-03-14): Score 1, Average 2. Not higher.
- Respondent 2 (2025-04-04): Score 3, Average 3. Not higher.
- Respondent 7 (2025-03-14): Score 3, Average 2. Higher.
- Respondent 1 (2025-05-02): Score 2, Average 2.33. Not higher.
- Respondent 22 (2025-05-16): Score 3, Average 3. Not higher.

**Respondents with a 'Background (examination)' score higher than the average for their session date:** 17, 12, 7.

Therefore, the number of respondents who meet the criteria is **3**.",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents whose comments contain 'Clear' also have a total score across all rubric items that is below the average total score for all sessions?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the total score for each respondent across all rubric items, then find the average total score for all sessions. After that, we can identify which respondents have comments containing 'Clear' and a total score below the average.

1. **Calculate total score for each respondent:**
   - For each respondent, sum up the scores for ""Identification"", ""Situation"", ""Background (history)"", ""Background (examination)"", ""Assessment"", ""Recommendation (clear recommendation)"", and ""Recommendation (global rating scale)"".

2. **Find the average total score for all sessions:**
   - Sum up all the total scores calculated in step 1.
   - Divide the sum by the total number of respondents to find the average total score.

3. **Identify respondents with comments containing 'Clear' and total score below average:**
   - For each respondent, check if their comment contains the word 'Clear'.
   - If it does, check if their total score is below the average total score calculated in step 2.

Let's perform these steps with the given data:

**Step 1: Calculate total scores**

- Respondent 11: 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 21
- Respondent 19: 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 3 = 20
- Respondent 14: 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 2 = 16
- Respondent 22: 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 19
- Respondent 13: 3 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 15
- Respondent 21: 3 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 3 = 17
- Respondent 10: 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 14
- Respondent 4: 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 17

**Step 2: Find the average total score**

- Sum of total scores = 21 + 20 + 16 + 19 + 15 + 17 + 14 + 17 = 139
- Number of respondents = 8
- Average total score = 139 / 8 = 17.375

**Step 3: Identify respondents with 'Clear' in comments and total score below average**

- Respondent 11: Comment contains 'Clear', total score is 21 (above average)
- Respondent 19: Comment does not contain 'Clear'
- Respondent 14: Comment does not contain 'Clear'
- Respondent 22: Comment contains 'Clear', total score is 19 (below average)
- Respondent 13: Comment does not contain 'Clear'
- Respondent 21: Comment does not contain 'Clear'
- Respondent 10: Comment does not contain 'Clear'
- Respondent 4: Comment contains 'Clear', total score is 17 (below average)

Respondents with comments containing 'Clear' and a total score below the average are Respondent 22 and Respondent 4.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents whose comments contain 'Satisfactory' also have a total score across all rubric items that is below the average total score for all sessions?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the total score for each respondent across all rubric items, then find the average total score for all sessions. After that, we can identify which respondents have comments containing 'Satisfactory' and a total score below the average.

1. **Identify Rubric Items and Calculate Total Score for Each Respondent:**
   - The rubric items are: Identification, Situation, Background (history), Background (examination), Assessment, Recommendation (clear recommendation), Recommendation (global rating scale).
   - For each respondent, we sum the scores of these items to get the total score.

2. **Calculate Average Total Score for All Sessions:**
   - Sum all the total scores of the respondents.
   - Divide by the number of respondents to get the average total score.

3. **Identify Respondents with 'Satisfactory' in Comments and Total Score Below Average:**
   - Check each respondent's comments for 'Satisfactory'.
   - Compare their total score to the average total score.

Let's calculate:

**Respondent 1:** Total score = -1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 2 = 12
**Respondent 11:** Total score = 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 21
**Respondent 6:** Total score = 3 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 18
**Respondent 20:** Total score = 3 + 3 + 2 + -1 + 3 + 2 + 3 = 15
**Respondent 15:** Total score = 3 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 17
**Respondent 12:** Total score = 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 3 = 20
**Respondent 3:** Total score = 0 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 17
**Respondent 14:** Total score = 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 2 = 16
**Respondent 16:** Total score = 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 3 = 20
**Respondent 2:** Total score = 3 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 17
**Respondent 4:** Total score = 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 17

**Total Scores:** 12, 21, 18, 15, 17, 20, 17, 16, 20, 17, 17
**Sum of Total Scores:** 12 + 21 + 18 + 15 + 17 + 20 + 17 + 16 + 20 + 17 + 17 = 184
**Number of Respondents:** 11
**Average Total Score:** 184 / 11 = 16.73

**Respondents with 'Satisfactory' in Comments:**
- Respondent 1: Comments = ""Satisfactory"", Total score = 12
- Respondent 16: Comments = ""Consent denied for video recordings Satisfactory"", Total score = 20
- Respondent 4: Comments = ""Clinical handover and communication skills, satisfactory No panic, no arrest team Satisfactory"", Total score = 17

**Respondents with Total Score Below Average and 'Satisfactory' in Comments:**
- Respondent 1: Total score = 12, which is below the average of 16.73.

Therefore, there is **1** respondent whose comments contain 'Satisfactory' and have a total score below the average total score for all sessions.",True
