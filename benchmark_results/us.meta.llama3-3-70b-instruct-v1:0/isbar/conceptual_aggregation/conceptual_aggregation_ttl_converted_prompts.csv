</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Background (examination)' and 'Assessment' is greater than 5.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to analyze the 'responses' section of the provided data and calculate the total score for 'Background_examination' and 'Assessment' for each respondent. We then compare this total to the threshold of 5 and count the respondents who exceed this threshold.

1. **Respondent19**: Background_examination = 3, Assessment = 2. Total = 5.
2. **Respondent7**: Background_examination = 3, Assessment = 2. Total = 5.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and 'Situation' is greater than 5.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to analyze the 'responses' section of the provided data and calculate the total score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and 'Situation' for each respondent. The scores for these fields can be found in the 'questions' section, but since they are not multiple-choice questions with letter codes, we will directly use the numerical values provided in the responses.

The 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' field is represented by `pred:Recommendation_clear_recommendation` and the 'Situation' field by `pred:Situation`. We will sum these two scores for each respondent and count those whose total is greater than 5.

Let's calculate the total score for each respondent:

1. Respondent5: `pred:Recommendation_clear_recommendation` = 2, `pred:Situation` = 3, Total = 2 + 3 = 5
2. Respondent1: `pred:Recommendation_clear_recommendation` = 2, `pred:Situation` = 2, Total = 2 + 2 = 4
3. Respondent12: `pred:Recommendation_clear_recommendation` = 3, `pred:Situation` = 3, Total = 3 + 3 = 6
4. Respondent8: `pred:Recommendation_clear_recommendation` = 2, `pred:Situation` = 3, Total = 2 + 3 = 5
5. Respondent19: `pred:Recommendation_clear_recommendation` = 3, `pred:Situation` = 3, Total = 3 + 3 = 6

Now, let's count the respondents whose total score is greater than 5:

- Respondent12 has a total score of 6.
- Respondent19 has a total score of 6.

Therefore, there are 2 respondents whose total score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and 'Situation' is greater than 5.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and 'Background (history)' is greater than 5.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to analyze the 'responses' section of the provided data and calculate the total score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and 'Background (history)' for each respondent.

The relevant fields are:
- `pred:Recommendation_clear_recommendation`
- `pred:Background_history`

We will iterate through each respondent and sum the scores of these two fields. If the sum is greater than 5, we count the respondent.

Here are the calculations:

1. Respondent3: `3 (Recommendation_clear_recommendation)` + `3 (Background_history)` = 6 (Counted)
2. Respondent23: `3 (Recommendation_clear_recommendation)` + `2 (Background_history)` = 5 (Not counted)
3. Respondent11: `3 (Recommendation_clear_recommendation)` + `3 (Background_history)` = 6 (Counted)
4. Respondent20: `2 (Recommendation_clear_recommendation)` + `2 (Background_history)` = 4 (Not counted)
5. Respondent5: `2 (Recommendation_clear_recommendation)` + `3 (Background_history)` = 5 (Not counted)
6. Respondent22: `2 (Recommendation_clear_recommendation)` + `3 (Background_history)` = 5 (Not counted)
7. Respondent19: `3 (Recommendation_clear_recommendation)` + `3 (Background_history)` = 6 (Counted)
8. Respondent9: `3 (Recommendation_clear_recommendation)` + `2 (Background_history)` = 5 (Not counted)
9. Respondent10: `2 (Recommendation_clear_recommendation)` + `2 (Background_history)` = 4 (Not counted)
10. Respondent21: `3 (Recommendation_clear_recommendation)` + `3 (Background_history)` = 6 (Counted)
11. Respondent15: `2 (Recommendation_clear_recommendation)` + `2 (Background_history)` = 4 (Not counted)

Count of respondents with a total score greater than 5: 4

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 'Assessment' is greater than 5.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to analyze the 'responses' section of the provided data and calculate the total score for 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 'Assessment' for each respondent. The relevant fields are `pred:Recommendation_global_rating_scale` and `pred:Assessment`.

Here are the calculations for each respondent:

1. Respondent2: `pred:Recommendation_global_rating_scale` = 1, `pred:Assessment` = 3, Total = 4
2. Respondent10: `pred:Recommendation_global_rating_scale` = 2, `pred:Assessment` = 2, Total = 4
3. Respondent20: `pred:Recommendation_global_rating_scale` = 3, `pred:Assessment` = 3, Total = 6
4. Respondent22: `pred:Recommendation_global_rating_scale` = 3, `pred:Assessment` = 2, Total = 5
5. Respondent12: `pred:Recommendation_global_rating_scale` = 3, `pred:Assessment` = 2, Total = 5
6. Respondent4: `pred:Recommendation_global_rating_scale` = 2, `pred:Assessment` = 2, Total = 4
7. Respondent17: `pred:Recommendation_global_rating_scale` = 2, `pred:Assessment` = 3, Total = 5
8. Respondent7: `pred:Recommendation_global_rating_scale` = 2, `pred:Assessment` = 2, Total = 4
9. Respondent3: `pred:Recommendation_global_rating_scale` = 3, `pred:Assessment` = 3, Total = 6
10. Respondent11: `pred:Recommendation_global_rating_scale` = 3, `pred:Assessment` = 3, Total = 6
11. Respondent8: `pred:Recommendation_global_rating_scale` = 3, `pred:Assessment` = 2, Total = 5

Now, let's count the respondents whose total score is greater than 5:
- Respondent20: Total = 6
- Respondent3: Total = 6
- Respondent11: Total = 6

There are 3 respondents whose total score for 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 'Assessment' is greater than 5.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who participated in a session where the average 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' for that session name is greater than 2.5.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' for each session name. Then, we count the respondents who participated in sessions where this average is greater than 2.5.

Given data:

- Session names and their corresponding 'Recommendation_global_rating_scale' values are as follows:
  - II (Anaphylaxis): 3 (Respondent12)
  - V (Hypoglycemia): 2 (Respondent1)
  - II (Anaphylactic Shock): 3 (Respondent6)
  - II - Anaphylaxsis: 3 (Respondent5)
  - I - MI: 3 (Respondent19)
  - I-VF: 2 (Respondent13)
  - III-Sepsis: 3 (Respondent3)
  - IV (VT): 3 (Respondent20)
  - II-Anaphylaxsis: 3 (Respondent23)
  - IV (AF): 3 (Respondent11)

Calculating averages for each unique session name:
- II (Anaphylaxis): 3 (1 respondent)
- II (Anaphylactic Shock): 3 (1 respondent)
- II - Anaphylaxsis: 3 (1 respondent)
- II-Anaphylaxsis: 3 (1 respondent)
- I - MI: 3 (1 respondent)
- I-VF: 2 (1 respondent)
- III-Sepsis: 3 (1 respondent)
- IV (VT): 3 (1 respondent)
- IV (AF): 3 (1 respondent)
- V (Hypoglycemia): 2 (1 respondent)

Since each session name has only one respondent, the average 'Recommendation_global_rating_scale' for each session is the value given by the respondent.

Counting respondents in sessions with an average 'Recommendation_global_rating_scale' greater than 2.5:
- Respondent12 (II (Anaphylaxis))
- Respondent6 (II (Anaphylactic Shock))
- Respondent5 (II - Anaphylaxsis)
- Respondent23 (II-Anaphylaxsis)
- Respondent19 (I - MI)
- Respondent3 (III-Sepsis)
- Respondent20 (IV (VT))
- Respondent11 (IV (AF))

There are 8 respondents who participated in sessions where the average 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is greater than 2.5.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who participated in a session where the average 'Situation' for that session name is greater than 2.0.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Situation' score for each session name, and then count the respondents who participated in sessions where this average is greater than 2.0.

Given the data, we can calculate the average 'Situation' score for each session name as follows:

1. **III-Sepsis**: Respondents 3, 7, and 15 participated in this session.
   - Respondent 3: Situation = 2
   - Respondent 7: Situation = 3
   - Respondent 15: Situation = 3
   - Average Situation = (2 + 3 + 3) / 3 = 8 / 3 = 2.67

2. **V (Hypoglycemia)**: Respondent 17 participated in this session.
   - Respondent 17: Situation = 3
   - Average Situation = 3

3. **I-VF**: Respondent 13 participated in this session.
   - Respondent 13: Situation = 3
   - Average Situation = 3

4. **IV-Hypoglycemia**: Respondent 14 participated in this session.
   - Respondent 14: Situation = 3
   - Average Situation = 3

5. **IV (AF)**: Respondent 11 participated in this session.
   - Respondent 11: Situation = 3
   - Average Situation = 3

6. **II (Anaphylactic Shock)**: Respondent 6 participated in this session.
   - Respondent 6: Situation = 2
   - Average Situation = 2

Sessions with an average 'Situation' score greater than 2.0 are:
- **III-Sepsis** (average = 2.67)
- **V (Hypoglycemia)** (average = 3)
- **I-VF** (average = 3)
- **IV-Hypoglycemia** (average = 3)
- **IV (AF)** (average = 3)

Respondents who participated in these sessions are:
- Respondent 3 (III-Sepsis)
- Respondent 7 (III-Sepsis)
- Respondent 15 (III-Sepsis)
- Respondent 17 (V (Hypoglycemia))
- Respondent 13 (I-VF)
- Respondent 14 (IV-Hypoglycemia)
- Respondent 11 (IV (AF))

Count of respondents = 7

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who participated in a session where the average 'Background (examination)' for that session name is greater than 2.0.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Background (examination)' score for each session name and then count the respondents who participated in sessions where this average is greater than 2.0.

1. **Identify Session Names and Their Corresponding 'Background (examination)' Scores:**

From the provided data, we extract the session names and their 'Background (examination)' scores:

- **(MI)-VT**: 2
- **IV (AF)**: 3
- **I - MI**: 3
- **IV (VT)**: -1
- **III-Sepsis**: 3
- **MI**: 3
- **II - Anaphylaxsis**: 3
- **II (Anaphylactic Shock)**: 3
- **I-VF**: 1
- **II-Anaphylaxsis**: 2

2. **Calculate the Average 'Background (examination)' Score for Each Session Name:**

Since each session name appears only once in the data provided, the average score for each session is the score itself. However, for the purpose of this task, we need to consider if there are multiple respondents for the same session name, which is not the case here.

3. **Count Respondents in Sessions with Average 'Background (examination)' Greater Than 2.0:**

We look for session names with scores greater than 2.0:
- **IV (AF)**: 3
- **I - MI**: 3
- **III-Sepsis**: 3
- **MI**: 3
- **II - Anaphylaxsis**: 3
- **II (Anaphylactic Shock)**: 3

These sessions have scores greater than 2.0. Now, we count the respondents:
- Respondent11 (IV (AF))
- Respondent19 (I - MI)
- Respondent3 (III-Sepsis)
- Respondent2 (MI)
- Respondent5 (II - Anaphylaxsis)
- Respondent6 (II (Anaphylactic Shock))

There are 6 respondents in sessions with an average 'Background (examination)' score greater than 2.0.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who participated in a session where the average 'Assessment' for that session name is greater than 2.5.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Assessment' score for each session name and then count the respondents who participated in sessions where this average is greater than 2.5.

Given data:

- Session names and their corresponding 'Assessment' scores are as follows:
  - ""IV (VT)"": 2 (Respondent22), 3 (Respondent20)
  - ""III-Sepsis"": 3 (Respondent3), 2 (Respondent15)
  - ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"": 2 (Respondent9)
  - ""IV-Hypoglycemia"": 3 (Respondent14)
  - ""I - MI"": 3 (Respondent16), 2 (Respondent19)

Calculating average 'Assessment' scores for each session:

- ""IV (VT)"": (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5
- ""III-Sepsis"": (3 + 2) / 2 = 2.5
- ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"": 2 (only one respondent)
- ""IV-Hypoglycemia"": 3 (only one respondent)
- ""I - MI"": (3 + 2) / 2 = 2.5

Sessions with an average 'Assessment' score greater than 2.5:

- ""IV-Hypoglycemia"" (average = 3)
  
Respondents who participated in these sessions:

- Respondent14

However, upon reevaluation, it's clear that the initial interpretation was too narrow. The task requires counting respondents in sessions where the average 'Assessment' score is greater than 2.5. Given the corrected understanding of the averages:

- ""IV (VT)"", ""III-Sepsis"", and ""I - MI"" all have an average of exactly 2.5, which does not meet the criteria of being greater than 2.5.
- ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"" has an average of 2, which also does not meet the criteria.
- ""IV-Hypoglycemia"" has an average of 3, which meets the criteria.

Thus, the correct count of respondents who participated in a session with an average 'Assessment' score greater than 2.5 is based on the sessions that actually exceed the 2.5 threshold.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents whose comments contain 'Good' also have a total score across all rubric items that is below the average total score for all sessions?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the total score for each respondent across all rubric items, then find the average total score for all sessions. After that, we can identify which respondents have comments containing 'Good' and a total score below the average.

1. **Calculate total score for each respondent:**

The rubric items are: Identification, Situation, Background_history, Background_examination, Assessment, Recommendation_clear_recommendation, Recommendation_global_rating_scale.

- Respondent7: 3 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 17
- Respondent17: 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 = 20
- Respondent4: 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 17
- Respondent12: 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 3 = 20
- Respondent14: 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 2 = 16
- Respondent21: 3 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 3 = 17
- Respondent10: 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 14
- Respondent16: 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 3 = 20
- Respondent9: 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 2 = 17
- Respondent11: 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 21

2. **Find the average total score for all sessions:**

Total scores: 17, 20, 17, 20, 16, 17, 14, 20, 17, 21
Sum of total scores = 17 + 20 + 17 + 20 + 16 + 17 + 14 + 20 + 17 + 21 = 179
Number of sessions = 10
Average total score = Sum of total scores / Number of sessions = 179 / 10 = 17.9

3. **Identify respondents whose comments contain 'Good' and have a total score below the average:**

- Respondent12 has a comment ""Good"" and a total score of 20, which is above the average.
- Respondent21 has a comment ""Diagnostic clarity is present Good and early assessment of condition is done"" which contains 'Good', and a total score of 17, which is below the average.
- Respondent11 has a comment ""Clear communication and handover"" which does not contain 'Good'.
- Respondent16 has a comment ""Consent denied for video recordings Satisfactory"" which does not contain 'Good'.

Only Respondent21 meets the criteria of having a comment containing 'Good' and a total score (17) below the average total score (17.9).

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who participated in a session where the average 'Situation' for that session name is greater than 2.0.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Situation' score for each unique session name. Then, we identify which of these averages are greater than 2.0. Finally, we count how many respondents participated in sessions with such averages.

Given the data, let's calculate the average 'Situation' score for each session name:

1. **MI**: Respondent2 has a Situation score of ""3"". 
2. **III (Sepsis)**: Respondents 8, 4 have Situation scores of ""3"", ""3"" respectively. Average = (3+3)/2 = 3.
3. **I-VF**: Respondent13 has a Situation score of ""3"".
4. **IV (VT)**: Respondent20 has a Situation score of ""3"".
5. **II-Anaphylaxsis**: Respondent23 has a Situation score of ""3"".
6. **V (Hypoglycemia)**: Respondent1 has a Situation score of ""2"".
7. **III-Sepsis**: Respondent7 has a Situation score of ""3"".
8. **(MI)-VT**: Respondent10 has a Situation score of ""2"".
9. **I (Myocardial infarction)**: Respondent21 has a Situation score of ""2"".

Now, let's identify the session names with an average 'Situation' score greater than 2.0:
- **MI**: 3
- **III (Sepsis)**: 3
- **I-VF**: 3
- **IV (VT)**: 3
- **II-Anaphylaxsis**: 3
- **III-Sepsis**: 3

These are the sessions with averages greater than 2.0. Now, let's count the respondents who participated in these sessions:
- **MI**: Respondent2
- **III (Sepsis)**: Respondents 8, 4
- **I-VF**: Respondent13
- **IV (VT)**: Respondent20
- **II-Anaphylaxsis**: Respondent23
- **III-Sepsis**: Respondent7

Counting them: Respondent2, Respondent8, Respondent4, Respondent13, Respondent20, Respondent23, Respondent7. That makes 7 respondents.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents have a 'Identification' score that is higher than the average 'Identification' for all sessions on the same date?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Identification' score for each date, and then compare each respondent's 'Identification' score to the average for their respective date.

1. Calculate the average 'Identification' score for each date:
   - For ""2025-05-04"", there is only 1 respondent (:Respondent9) with an 'Identification' score of ""3"". Average = 3.
   - For ""2025-03-14"", there are 2 respondents (:Respondent10, :Respondent14) with 'Identification' scores of ""2"" and ""3"". Average = (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5.
   - For ""2025-04-04"", there are 3 respondents (:Respondent11, :Respondent6, :Respondent3) with 'Identification' scores of ""3"", ""3"", and ""0"". Average = (3 + 3 + 0) / 3 = 2.
   - For ""2025-05-16"", there is only 1 respondent (:Respondent4) with an 'Identification' score of ""3"". Average = 3.
   - For ""2025-05-02"", there are 2 respondents (:Respondent1, :Respondent16) with 'Identification' scores of ""-1"" and ""3"". Average = (-1 + 3) / 2 = 1.

2. Compare each respondent's 'Identification' score to the average for their date:
   - :Respondent9 (2025-05-04) has a score of 3, which is equal to the average. Not higher.
   - :Respondent10 (2025-03-14) has a score of 2, which is lower than the average of 2.5. Not higher.
   - :Respondent14 (2025-03-14) has a score of 3, which is higher than the average of 2.5. Higher.
   - :Respondent11 (2025-04-04) has a score of 3, which is higher than the average of 2. Higher.
   - :Respondent6 (2025-04-04) has a score of 3, which is higher than the average of 2. Higher.
   - :Respondent3 (2025-04-04) has a score of 0, which is lower than the average of 2. Not higher.
   - :Respondent4 (2025-05-16) has a score of 3, which is equal to the average. Not higher.
   - :Respondent1 (2025-05-02) has a score of -1, which is lower than the average of 1. Not higher.
   - :Respondent16 (2025-05-02) has a score of 3, which is higher than the average of 1. Higher.

Count of respondents with an 'Identification' score higher than the average for their date: 4.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents have a 'Background (examination)' score that is higher than the average 'Background (examination)' for all sessions on the same date?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Background (examination)' score for each date, and then compare each respondent's score to the average score for their respective date.

From the provided data:

1. **Date: 2025-03-14**
   - Respondent13: 1
   - Respondent7: 3
   - Respondent23: 2
   - Average = (1 + 3 + 2) / 3 = 6 / 3 = 2

2. **Date: 2025-04-04**
   - Respondent3: 3
   - Respondent2: 3
   - Average = (3 + 3) / 2 = 6 / 2 = 3

3. **Date: 2025-05-02**
   - Respondent8: 2
   - Respondent12: 3
   - Respondent1: 2
   - Average = (2 + 3 + 2) / 3 = 7 / 3 = 2.33

4. **Date: 2025-05-04**
   - Respondent18: 2
   - Respondent17: 3
   - Average = (2 + 3) / 2 = 5 / 2 = 2.5

5. **Date: 2025-05-16**
   - Respondent22: 3
   - Since there's only one respondent for this date, the average is 3.

Now, comparing each respondent's 'Background (examination)' score to the average for their date:

1. **2025-03-14**
   - Respondent13 (1) is lower than the average (2).
   - Respondent7 (3) is higher than the average (2).
   - Respondent23 (2) is equal to the average (2).

2. **2025-04-04**
   - Both Respondent3 (3) and Respondent2 (3) are equal to the average (3).

3. **2025-05-02**
   - Respondent8 (2) is lower than the average (2.33).
   - Respondent12 (3) is higher than the average (2.33).
   - Respondent1 (2) is lower than the average (2.33).

4. **2025-05-04**
   - Respondent18 (2) is lower than the average (2.5).
   - Respondent17 (3) is higher than the average (2.5).

5. **2025-05-16**
   - Respondent22 (3) is equal to the average (3), but since there's no one to compare with, we consider this as not higher than an average of others on the same date.

Counting the respondents with a 'Background (examination)' score higher than the average for their date:
- Respondent7
- Respondent12
- Respondent17

There are **3** respondents with a 'Background (examination)' score higher than the average for all sessions on the same date.",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents whose comments contain 'Clear' also have a total score across all rubric items that is below the average total score for all sessions?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the total score for each respondent across all rubric items, then find the average total score for all sessions. After that, we can identify which respondents have comments containing 'Clear' and a total score below the average.

1. **Calculate total score for each respondent:**

   - Respondent11: 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 18
   - Respondent19: 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 3 = 17
   - Respondent14: 3 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 2 = 14
   - Respondent22: 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 16
   - Respondent13: 3 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 13
   - Respondent21: 3 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 14
   - Respondent10: 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 12
   - Respondent4: 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 15

2. **Find the average total score for all sessions:**

   Total scores: 18, 17, 14, 16, 13, 14, 12, 15
   Sum of total scores: 18 + 17 + 14 + 16 + 13 + 14 + 12 + 15 = 119
   Number of sessions: 8
   Average total score: 119 / 8 = 14.875

3. **Identify respondents whose comments contain 'Clear' and have a total score below the average:**

   - Respondent11 has a comment ""Clear communication and handover"" and a total score of 18, which is above the average.
   - Respondent19 has a comment ""Wrong CPR position Clarity is a bit low over whole case scenario Satisfactory"" which contains 'Clarity', not exactly 'Clear', and a total score of 17, which is above the average.
   - Respondent22 has a comment ""Clear communication skills Good"" and a total score of 16, which is above the average.

No respondents have comments that exactly contain 'Clear' and a total score below the average total score for all sessions.

The final answer is: 0",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents whose comments contain 'Satisfactory' also have a total score across all rubric items that is below the average total score for all sessions?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the total score for each respondent across all rubric items, then find the average total score for all sessions. After that, we can identify which respondents have comments containing 'Satisfactory' and a total score below the average.

1. **Calculate Total Score for Each Respondent:**
   - For each respondent, sum up the scores for `Identification`, `Situation`, `Background_history`, `Background_examination`, `Assessment`, `Recommendation_clear_recommendation`, and `Recommendation_global_rating_scale`.

2. **Find Average Total Score for All Sessions:**
   - Sum up all the total scores calculated in step 1.
   - Divide the sum by the total number of respondents to find the average total score.

3. **Identify Respondents with 'Satisfactory' in Comments and Below-Average Score:**
   - Filter respondents whose comments contain 'Satisfactory'.
   - Among these, count those whose total score is less than the average total score calculated in step 2.

Let's perform these steps with the given data:

### Step 1: Calculate Total Scores

- Respondent1: -1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 2 = 12
- Respondent11: 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 21
- Respondent6: 3 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 18
- Respondent20: 3 + 3 + 2 + -1 + 3 + 2 + 3 = 15
- Respondent15: 3 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 17
- Respondent12: 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 3 = 20
- Respondent3: 0 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 17
- Respondent14: 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 2 = 16
- Respondent16: 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 3 = 20
- Respondent2: 3 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 17
- Respondent4: 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 17

### Step 2: Calculate Average Total Score

Total sum = 12 + 21 + 18 + 15 + 17 + 20 + 17 + 16 + 20 + 17 + 17 = 174
Number of respondents = 11
Average total score = 174 / 11 ≈ 15.82

### Step 3: Identify Respondents with 'Satisfactory' in Comments and Below-Average Score

Respondents with 'Satisfactory' in comments: Respondent1, Respondent16
- Respondent1's score: 12 (Below average)
- Respondent16's score: 20 (Above average)

Only Respondent1 meets the criteria of having 'Satisfactory' in their comments and a total score below the average.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$",True
