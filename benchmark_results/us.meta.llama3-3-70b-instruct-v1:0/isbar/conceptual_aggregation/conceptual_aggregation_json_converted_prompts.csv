</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who scored 3 on 'Background (examination)'.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Background (examination)' and 'Assessment' is greater than 5.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to iterate through each respondent's answers in the 'responses' section and calculate the total score for 'Background (examination)' and 'Assessment'. We then compare this total to 5 and count the respondents where the total is greater than 5.

Given data:
- 'Background (examination)' scores range from 0 to 3.
- 'Assessment' scores range from 0 to 3.

Thus, the maximum total score for 'Background (examination)' and 'Assessment' is 6 (3+3), and the minimum is 0 (0+0).

Let's calculate the total score for each respondent:

1. Respondent ""19"": 'Background (examination)' = 3, 'Assessment' = 2, Total = 5.
2. Respondent ""7"": 'Background (examination)' = 3, 'Assessment' = 2, Total = 5.
3. Respondent ""3"": 'Background (examination)' = 3, 'Assessment' = 3, Total = 6.
4. Respondent ""18"": 'Background (examination)' = 2, 'Assessment' = 3, Total = 5.
5. Respondent ""22"": 'Background (examination)' = 3, 'Assessment' = 2, Total = 5.
6. Respondent ""23"": 'Background (examination)' = 2, 'Assessment' = 3, Total = 5.
7. Respondent ""8"": 'Background (examination)' = 2, 'Assessment' = 2, Total = 4.

From the calculations, only Respondent ""3"" has a total score greater than 5.

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and 'Background (history)' is greater than 5.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to iterate through each respondent's answers in the 'responses' section and calculate the sum of their scores for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and 'Background (history)'. We then count how many respondents have a total score greater than 5 for these two categories.

Given the data:

1. Respondent ""3"": 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' = 3, 'Background (history)' = 3. Total = 6.
2. Respondent ""23"": 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' = 3, 'Background (history)' = 2. Total = 5.
3. Respondent ""11"": 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' = 3, 'Background (history)' = 3. Total = 6.
4. Respondent ""20"": 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' = 2, 'Background (history)' = 2. Total = 4.
5. Respondent ""5"": 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' = 2, 'Background (history)' = 3. Total = 5.
6. Respondent ""22"": 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' = 2, 'Background (history)' = 3. Total = 5.
7. Respondent ""19"": 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' = 3, 'Background (history)' = 3. Total = 6.
8. Respondent ""9"": 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' = 3, 'Background (history)' = 2. Total = 5.
9. Respondent ""10"": 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' = 2, 'Background (history)' = 2. Total = 4.
10. Respondent ""21"": 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' = 3, 'Background (history)' = 3. Total = 6.
11. Respondent ""15"": 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' = 2, 'Background (history)' = 2. Total = 4.

Respondents with a total score greater than 5 are: ""3"", ""11"", ""19"", ""21"".

Therefore, the number of respondents whose total score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and 'Background (history)' is greater than 5 is 4.",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 'Assessment' is greater than 5.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to iterate through each respondent's answers in the 'responses' section and calculate the sum of their scores for 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 'Assessment'. We then count how many respondents have a total score greater than 5 for these two categories.

Given the data:

1. Respondent 2: 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' = 1, 'Assessment' = 3, Total = 4
2. Respondent 10: 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' = 2, 'Assessment' = 2, Total = 4
3. Respondent 20: 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' = 3, 'Assessment' = 3, Total = 6
4. Respondent 22: 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' = 3, 'Assessment' = 2, Total = 5
5. Respondent 12: 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' = 3, 'Assessment' = 2, Total = 5
6. Respondent 4: 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' = 2, 'Assessment' = 2, Total = 4
7. Respondent 17: 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' = 2, 'Assessment' = 3, Total = 5
8. Respondent 7: 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' = 2, 'Assessment' = 2, Total = 4
9. Respondent 3: 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' = 3, 'Assessment' = 3, Total = 6
10. Respondent 11: 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' = 3, 'Assessment' = 3, Total = 6
11. Respondent 8: 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' = 3, 'Assessment' = 2, Total = 5

From the calculations above, the respondents with a total score greater than 5 are:
- Respondent 20 (Total = 6)
- Respondent 3 (Total = 6)
- Respondent 11 (Total = 6)

Therefore, the number of respondents whose total score for 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 'Assessment' is greater than 5 is 3.",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who participated in a session where the average 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' for that session name is greater than 2.5.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' for each session name, and then count the respondents who participated in sessions where this average is greater than 2.5.

Given the data, let's calculate the average 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' for each session name:

1. **II (Anaphylaxis)**: Respondent 12 has a score of 3.
2. **V (Hypoglycemia)**: Respondent 1 has a score of 2.
3. **II (Anaphylactic Shock)**: Respondent 6 has a score of 3.
4. **II - Anaphylaxsis**: Respondent 5 has a score of 3.
5. **I - MI**: Respondent 19 has a score of 3.
6. **I-VF**: Respondent 13 has a score of 2.
7. **III-Sepsis**: Respondent 3 has a score of 3.
8. **IV (VT)**: Respondent 20 has a score of 3.
9. **II-Anaphylaxsis**: Respondent 23 has a score of 3.
10. **IV (AF)**: Respondent 11 has a score of 3.

Since each session name (except for those with the same name but potentially different cases or slight variations) appears only once, the average for each is the score itself. However, for sessions with the same name but different descriptions (like ""II (Anaphylaxis)"" and ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" or ""II (Anaphylactic Shock)""), we treat them as distinct due to the differences in their descriptions.

Sessions with averages greater than 2.5 are:
- **II (Anaphylaxis)**: 3
- **II (Anaphylactic Shock)**: 3
- **II - Anaphylaxsis**: 3
- **I - MI**: 3
- **III-Sepsis**: 3
- **IV (VT)**: 3
- **II-Anaphylaxsis**: 3
- **IV (AF)**: 3

Respondents in these sessions are:
- 12 (II (Anaphylaxis))
- 6 (II (Anaphylactic Shock))
- 5 (II - Anaphylaxsis)
- 19 (I - MI)
- 3 (III-Sepsis)
- 20 (IV (VT))
- 23 (II-Anaphylaxsis)
- 11 (IV (AF))

Counting these respondents gives us a total of 8 respondents who participated in sessions where the average 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' is greater than 2.5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who participated in a session where the average 'Situation' for that session name is greater than 2.0.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Situation' score for each session name, and then count the respondents who participated in sessions where this average is greater than 2.0.

Given the data, let's calculate the average 'Situation' score for each session name:

1. **III-Sepsis**: Respondents 3, 7, and 15 participated in this session.
   - Respondent 3's 'Situation' score: 2
   - Respondent 7's 'Situation' score: 3
   - Respondent 15's 'Situation' score: 3
   - Average 'Situation' score for **III-Sepsis**: (2 + 3 + 3) / 3 = 8 / 3 = 2.67

2. **V (Hypoglycemia)**: Respondent 17 participated in this session.
   - Respondent 17's 'Situation' score: 3
   - Average 'Situation' score for **V (Hypoglycemia)**: 3

3. **I-VF**: Respondent 13 participated in this session.
   - Respondent 13's 'Situation' score: 3
   - Average 'Situation' score for **I-VF**: 3

4. **IV-Hypoglycemia**: Respondent 14 participated in this session.
   - Respondent 14's 'Situation' score: 3
   - Average 'Situation' score for **IV-Hypoglycemia**: 3

5. **IV (AF)**: Respondent 11 participated in this session.
   - Respondent 11's 'Situation' score: 3
   - Average 'Situation' score for **IV (AF)**: 3

6. **II (Anaphylactic Shock)**: Respondent 6 participated in this session.
   - Respondent 6's 'Situation' score: 2
   - Average 'Situation' score for **II (Anaphylactic Shock)**: 2

Sessions with an average 'Situation' score greater than 2.0 are:
- **III-Sepsis** (average score: 2.67)
- **V (Hypoglycemia)** (average score: 3)
- **I-VF** (average score: 3)
- **IV-Hypoglycemia** (average score: 3)
- **IV (AF)** (average score: 3)

Respondents who participated in these sessions are:
- **III-Sepsis**: 3, 7, 15
- **V (Hypoglycemia)**: 17
- **I-VF**: 13
- **IV-Hypoglycemia**: 14
- **IV (AF)**: 11

Count of respondents: 3 (from **III-Sepsis**) + 1 (from **V (Hypoglycemia)**) + 1 (from **I-VF**) + 1 (from **IV-Hypoglycemia**) + 1 (from **IV (AF)**) = 7

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who participated in a session where the average 'Background (examination)' for that session name is greater than 2.0.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Background (examination)' score for each unique 'SessionName'. Then, we identify the sessions with an average score greater than 2.0 and count the respondents who participated in those sessions.

Given the data, let's calculate the average 'Background (examination)' score for each session:

1. **(MI)-VT**: 2
2. **IV (AF)**: 3
3. **I - MI**: 3
4. **IV (VT)**: -1
5. **III-Sepsis**: 3
6. **MI**: 3
7. **II - Anaphylaxsis**: 3
8. **II (Anaphylactic Shock)**: 3
9. **I-VF**: 1
10. **II-Anaphylaxsis**: 2

Now, let's identify sessions with an average 'Background (examination)' score greater than 2.0:
- **IV (AF)**: 3
- **I - MI**: 3
- **III-Sepsis**: 3
- **MI**: 3
- **II - Anaphylaxsis**: 3
- **II (Anaphylactic Shock)**: 3

Counting the respondents for these sessions:
- **IV (AF)**: Respondent 11
- **I - MI**: Respondent 19
- **III-Sepsis**: Respondent 3
- **MI**: Respondent 2
- **II - Anaphylaxsis**: Respondent 5
- **II (Anaphylactic Shock)**: Respondent 6

Therefore, the respondents who participated in sessions with an average 'Background (examination)' score greater than 2.0 are:
11, 19, 3, 2, 5, 6

There are 6 respondents in total.",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who participated in a session where the average 'Assessment' for that session name is greater than 2.5.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Assessment' score for each session name, and then count the respondents who participated in sessions where this average is greater than 2.5.

Given data:

- Session names and their corresponding 'Assessment' scores are as follows:
  - ""IV (VT)"": 2 (respondent 22), 3 (respondent 20)
  - ""III-Sepsis"": 3 (respondent 3)
  - ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"": 2 (respondent 9)
  - ""III - Sepsis"": 2 (respondent 15)
  - ""IV-Hypoglycemia"": 3 (respondent 14)
  - ""I - MI"": 3 (respondent 16), 2 (respondent 19)

Calculating average 'Assessment' scores for each session:

- ""IV (VT)"": (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5
- ""III-Sepsis"": 3 / 1 = 3
- ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"": 2 / 1 = 2
- ""III - Sepsis"": 2 / 1 = 2
- ""IV-Hypoglycemia"": 3 / 1 = 3
- ""I - MI"": (3 + 2) / 2 = 2.5

Sessions with an average 'Assessment' score greater than 2.5:

- ""III-Sepsis""
- ""IV-Hypoglycemia""

Respondents who participated in these sessions:

- ""III-Sepsis"": respondent 3
- ""IV-Hypoglycemia"": respondent 14

Count of respondents: 2

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents whose comments contain 'Good' also have a total score across all rubric items that is below the average total score for all sessions?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the total score for each respondent across all rubric items, then find the average total score for all sessions. After that, we can identify which respondents have comments containing 'Good' and a total score below the average.

1. **Calculate total score for each respondent:**
   - For each respondent, sum up the scores for ""Identification"", ""Situation"", ""Background (history)"", ""Background (examination)"", ""Assessment"", ""Recommendation (clear recommendation)"", and ""Recommendation (global rating scale)"".

2. **Find the average total score for all sessions:**
   - Sum up all the total scores calculated in step 1.
   - Divide the sum by the total number of respondents to find the average total score.

3. **Identify respondents with comments containing 'Good' and total score below average:**
   - Filter the respondents whose comments contain the word 'Good'.
   - Among these, count how many have a total score less than the average total score calculated in step 2.

Let's perform these steps with the given data:

### Step 1: Calculate total scores

1. Respondent 7: 3 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 17
2. Respondent 17: 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 = 20
3. Respondent 4: 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 17
4. Respondent 12: 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 3 = 20
5. Respondent 14: 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 2 = 16
6. Respondent 21: 3 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 3 = 17
7. Respondent 10: 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 14
8. Respondent 16: 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 3 = 20
9. Respondent 9: 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 2 = 17
10. Respondent 11: 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 21

### Step 2: Find the average total score

Sum of total scores = 17 + 20 + 17 + 20 + 16 + 17 + 14 + 20 + 17 + 21 = 179
Number of respondents = 10
Average total score = 179 / 10 = 17.9

### Step 3: Identify respondents with comments containing 'Good' and total score below average

Respondents with comments containing 'Good':
- Respondent 12: Total score = 20, Comment = ""Good""
- Respondent 21: Total score = 17, Comment = ""Diagnostic clarity is present\nGood and early assessment of condition is done""
- Respondent 11: Total score = 21, Comment = ""Clear communication and handover"" (Does not contain 'Good', so excluded)
- Respondent 16: Total score = 20, Comment = ""Consent denied for video recordings\nSatisfactory"" (Does not contain 'Good', so excluded)
- Respondent 4: Total score = 17, Comment = ""Clinical handover and communication skills, satisfactory\nNo panic, no arrest team\nSatisfactory"" (Does not contain 'Good', so excluded)
- Respondent 9: Total score = 17, Comment = ""Overall a bit unclear communication reflected"" (Does not contain 'Good', so excluded)

Among these, respondents with total score below average (17.9):
- Respondent 21: Total score = 17

Therefore, there is **1** respondent whose comments contain 'Good' and have a total score below the average total score for all sessions.",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who participated in a session where the average 'Situation' for that session name is greater than 2.0.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Situation' score for each unique 'SessionName'. Then, we identify which of these averages are greater than 2.0. Finally, we count how many respondents participated in sessions with those 'SessionName's.

Given the data:

1. **Calculate average 'Situation' score for each 'SessionName'**:
   - MI: [(3)] = 3
   - III (Sepsis): [(3), (3)] = 3
   - I-VF: [(3)] = 3
   - IV (VT): [(3)] = 3
   - II-Anaphylaxsis: [(3)] = 3
   - V (Hypoglycemia): [(2)] = 2
   - III-Sepsis: [(3)] = 3
   - (MI)-VT: [(2)] = 2
   - I (Myocardial infarction): [(2)] = 2

2. **Identify 'SessionName's with average 'Situation' greater than 2.0**:
   - MI
   - III (Sepsis)
   - I-VF
   - IV (VT)
   - II-Anaphylaxsis
   - III-Sepsis

3. **Count respondents in these sessions**:
   - Respondent 2 (MI)
   - Respondents 8, 4 (III (Sepsis))
   - Respondent 13 (I-VF)
   - Respondent 20 (IV (VT))
   - Respondent 23 (II-Anaphylaxsis)
   - Respondent 7 (III-Sepsis)

Therefore, the total number of respondents who participated in a session where the average 'Situation' for that session name is greater than 2.0 is 7.",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents have a 'Identification' score that is higher than the average 'Identification' for all sessions on the same date?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Identification' score for each date, and then compare each respondent's 'Identification' score to the average for their respective date.

Given data:

- Dates and 'Identification' scores are as follows:
  - 2025-05-04: 3
  - 2025-03-14: 2 (for respondent 10), 3 (for respondent 14)
  - 2025-04-04: 3 (for respondent 11), 3 (for respondent 6), 0 (for respondent 3)
  - 2025-05-16: 3
  - 2025-05-02: -1 (for respondent 1), 3 (for respondent 16)

Calculating averages for each date:
- 2025-05-04: 3 (only one respondent)
- 2025-03-14: (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5
- 2025-04-04: (3 + 3 + 0) / 3 = 2
- 2025-05-16: 3 (only one respondent)
- 2025-05-02: (-1 + 3) / 2 = 1

Now, comparing each respondent's 'Identification' score to the average for their date:
- Respondent 9 (2025-05-04): 3 == 3 (not higher)
- Respondent 10 (2025-03-14): 2 < 2.5 (not higher)
- Respondent 14 (2025-03-14): 3 > 2.5 (higher)
- Respondent 11 (2025-04-04): 3 > 2 (higher)
- Respondent 6 (2025-04-04): 3 > 2 (higher)
- Respondent 3 (2025-04-04): 0 < 2 (not higher)
- Respondent 4 (2025-05-16): 3 == 3 (not higher)
- Respondent 1 (2025-05-02): -1 < 1 (not higher)
- Respondent 16 (2025-05-02): 3 > 1 (higher)

Counting respondents with 'Identification' scores higher than the average for their date:
- Respondent 14
- Respondent 11
- Respondent 6
- Respondent 16

There are 4 respondents with 'Identification' scores higher than the average for their respective dates.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents have a 'Background (examination)' score that is higher than the average 'Background (examination)' for all sessions on the same date?
</task>","To solve this, we first need to calculate the average 'Background (examination)' score for each date, and then compare each respondent's score to this average to determine how many have a score higher than the average for their respective session dates.

Let's calculate the average 'Background (examination)' score for each date and then compare:

1. **2025-05-04**:
   - Respondent 18: 2
   - Respondent 17: 3
   - Average = (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5

2. **2025-05-02**:
   - Respondent 8: 2
   - Respondent 12: 3
   - Respondent 1: 2
   - Average = (2 + 3 + 2) / 3 = 2.33

3. **2025-03-14**:
   - Respondent 23: 2
   - Respondent 13: 1
   - Respondent 7: 3
   - Average = (2 + 1 + 3) / 3 = 2

4. **2025-04-04**:
   - Respondent 3: 3
   - Respondent 2: 3
   - Average = (3 + 3) / 2 = 3

5. **2025-05-16**:
   - Respondent 22: 3
   - Since there's only one respondent for this date, the average is 3.

Now, comparing each respondent's 'Background (examination)' score to the average for their session date:

- **2025-05-04**: 
  - Respondent 18 (2) is below the average (2.5).
  - Respondent 17 (3) is above the average (2.5).

- **2025-05-02**:
  - Respondent 8 (2) is below the average (2.33).
  - Respondent 12 (3) is above the average (2.33).
  - Respondent 1 (2) is below the average (2.33).

- **2025-03-14**:
  - Respondent 23 (2) is equal to the average (2).
  - Respondent 13 (1) is below the average (2).
  - Respondent 7 (3) is above the average (2).

- **2025-04-04**:
  - Both Respondent 3 (3) and Respondent 2 (3) are equal to the average (3).

- **2025-05-16**:
  - Respondent 22 (3) is equal to the average (3).

Counting the respondents with a 'Background (examination)' score higher than the average for their respective session dates:
- Respondent 17
- Respondent 12
- Respondent 7

Therefore, there are **3** respondents with a 'Background (examination)' score higher than the average for all sessions on the same date.",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents whose comments contain 'Clear' also have a total score across all rubric items that is below the average total score for all sessions?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the total score for each respondent across all rubric items, then find the average total score for all sessions. After that, we can identify which respondents have comments containing 'Clear' and a total score below the average.

1. **Calculate total score for each respondent:**

- Respondent 11: 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 21
- Respondent 19: 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 3 = 20
- Respondent 14: 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 2 = 16
- Respondent 22: 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 19
- Respondent 13: 3 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 15
- Respondent 21: 3 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 3 = 17
- Respondent 10: 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 14
- Respondent 4: 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 17

2. **Find the average total score for all sessions:**

Total scores: 21, 20, 16, 19, 15, 17, 14, 17
Sum of total scores = 21 + 20 + 16 + 19 + 15 + 17 + 14 + 17 = 139
Number of sessions = 8
Average total score = Sum of total scores / Number of sessions = 139 / 8 = 17.375

3. **Identify respondents with comments containing 'Clear' and total score below average:**

- Respondent 11: Comment contains 'Clear', total score is 21, which is above the average.
- Respondent 19: Comment contains 'Clear', total score is 20, which is above the average.
- Respondent 22: Comment contains 'Clear', total score is 19, which is above the average.

None of the respondents with comments containing 'Clear' have a total score below the average total score for all sessions.

The final answer is: $\boxed{0}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
How many respondents whose comments contain 'Satisfactory' also have a total score across all rubric items that is below the average total score for all sessions?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the total score for each respondent across all rubric items, then find the average total score for all sessions. After that, we can identify which respondents have comments containing 'Satisfactory' and a total score below the average.

1. **Calculate Total Score for Each Respondent:**
   - For each respondent, sum up the scores for ""Identification"", ""Situation"", ""Background (history)"", ""Background (examination)"", ""Assessment"", ""Recommendation (clear recommendation)"", and ""Recommendation (global rating scale)"".

2. **Find Average Total Score for All Sessions:**
   - Sum up all the total scores calculated in step 1.
   - Divide the sum by the total number of respondents to find the average total score.

3. **Identify Respondents with 'Satisfactory' in Comments and Below-Average Score:**
   - Filter respondents whose comments contain the word 'Satisfactory'.
   - Among these, count those whose total score is less than the average total score calculated in step 2.

Let's perform these steps with the given data:

### Step 1: Calculate Total Scores

1. Respondent 1: -1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 2 = 12
2. Respondent 11: 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 21
3. Respondent 6: 3 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 18
4. Respondent 20: 3 + 3 + 2 + (-1) + 3 + 2 + 3 = 15
5. Respondent 15: 3 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 17
6. Respondent 12: 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 3 = 20
7. Respondent 3: 0 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 17
8. Respondent 14: 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 2 = 16
9. Respondent 16: 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 3 = 20
10. Respondent 2: 3 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 17
11. Respondent 4: 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 17

### Step 2: Find Average Total Score

Sum of total scores = 12 + 21 + 18 + 15 + 17 + 20 + 17 + 16 + 20 + 17 + 17 = 174
Number of respondents = 11
Average total score = 174 / 11 ≈ 15.82

### Step 3: Identify Respondents with 'Satisfactory' in Comments and Below-Average Score

Respondents with 'Satisfactory' in comments: 
- Respondent 1 (Score: 12)
- Respondent 16 (Score: 20)
- Respondent 4 (Score: 17)

Among these, respondents with a score below the average (15.82):
- Respondent 1 (Score: 12)

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$",True
