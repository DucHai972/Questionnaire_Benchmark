</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Background (examination) of the respondent from the 'II - Anaphylaxsis' session on '2025-05-04'?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to find the respondent who participated in the 'II - Anaphylaxsis' session on '2025-05-04' and then look at their Background (examination) score.

From the responses section, we can see that there are two respondents who participated in the 'II - Anaphylaxsis' or 'II (Anaphylaxsis)' session on '2025-05-04': Respondent 5 and Respondent 9.

Respondent 5's Background (examination) score is 3, and Respondent 9's Background (examination) score is 2.

According to the questions schema, the Background (examination) scores are defined as follows:
- 0 = Observations are omitted or irrelevant
- 1 = Observations reported but frequent clarification needed
- 2 = Observations reported with few further questions needed
- 3 = Comprehensive focused examination/observations

Since the question asks for the Background (examination) of the respondent, we need to determine which respondent's data to use. However, the question does not specify which respondent to use in case of multiple matches. Given the information provided and following the instructions to the letter, we should look for the most direct match to the session name as specified in the question.

The question specifies 'II - Anaphylaxsis', which directly matches Respondent 5's session name 'II - Anaphylaxsis'. Therefore, we will use Respondent 5's data.

The Background (examination) score for Respondent 5 is 3, which corresponds to ""Comprehensive focused examination/observations"".

The final answer is: Comprehensive focused examination/observations",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Background (history) of the respondent whose total score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and 'Assessment' was exactly 4?
</task>","To find the respondent whose total score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and 'Assessment' was exactly 4, we need to look through the responses and calculate this total for each respondent.

1. Respondent 8: Recommendation (clear recommendation) = 2, Assessment = 2. Total = 4.
2. Respondent 6: Recommendation (clear recommendation) = 2, Assessment = 2. Total = 4.
3. Respondent 14: Recommendation (clear recommendation) = 1, Assessment = 3. Total = 4.
4. Respondent 16: Recommendation (clear recommendation) = 2, Assessment = 3. Total = 5.
5. Respondent 20: Recommendation (clear recommendation) = 2, Assessment = 3. Total = 5.
6. Respondent 7: Recommendation (clear recommendation) = 2, Assessment = 2. Total = 4.

The respondents with a total score of exactly 4 are Respondent 8, Respondent 6, Respondent 14, and Respondent 7.

Now, we need to find the Background (history) for these respondents:
- Respondent 8: Background (history) = 3
- Respondent 6: Background (history) = 3
- Respondent 14: Background (history) = 2
- Respondent 7: Background (history) = 2

Since the question asks for the Background (history) of the respondent(s) with a total score of exactly 4, and given that the Background (history) is scored on a rubric, we refer back to the schema to understand what these scores mean:
- 0 = History is unstructured or non-relevant
- 1 = Relevant history but frequent clarification needed
- 2 = Relevant history with few further questions needed
- 3 = Comprehensive focused history

Thus, the Background (history) for the respondents with a total score of exactly 4 is:
- For Respondent 8 and Respondent 6: Comprehensive focused history
- For Respondent 14 and Respondent 7: Relevant history with few further questions needed

Given the format requirements, the question seems to ask for a single answer, but there are multiple respondents with the same total score and different Background (history) scores. However, following the instructions to provide a human-readable value and considering the format rules, the most accurate interpretation of the task given the constraints would be to list the different Background (history) descriptions as they correspond to the scores of the identified respondents. But, since the format demands a single final answer and it seems there was an oversight in how the question was framed for a singular response, I will provide the answer based on the first matching respondent's score for clarity and adherence to the format:

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Identification of the respondent whose score for 'Situation' was 3 and score for 'Assessment' was 3?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to find the respondent whose score for 'Situation' was 3 and score for 'Assessment' was 3.

From the 'responses' section, we can see that the following respondents have a score of 3 for both 'Situation' and 'Assessment':

- Respondent 5: Situation = 3, Assessment = 3
- Respondent 11: Situation = 3, Assessment = 3
- Respondent 18: Situation = 3, Assessment = 3

Now, we need to find the Identification score for these respondents:

- Respondent 5: Identification = 3
- Respondent 11: Identification = 3
- Respondent 18: Identification = 3

Since all of these respondents have an Identification score of 3, the answer is 3, which corresponds to ""Introduces themselves and information is complete"" according to the schema. 

The final answer is: Introduces themselves and information is complete",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Identification of the respondent whose total score for 'Assessment' and 'Background (history)' was exactly 5?
</task>","To find the Identification of the respondent whose total score for 'Assessment' and 'Background (history)' was exactly 5, we need to look through the responses and calculate the total score for these two categories for each respondent.

The relevant scores are as follows:
- Assessment (Question 7)
- Background (history) (Question 5)

We are looking for a respondent with a total score of 5. This could be achieved with a score of 2 in Assessment and 3 in Background (history) or 3 in Assessment and 2 in Background (history), as these are the only combinations that add up to 5 given the scoring system.

Let's examine the responses:

1. Respondent 17: Assessment = 3, Background (history) = 3, Total = 6
2. Respondent 6: Assessment = 2, Background (history) = 3, Total = 5
3. Respondent 2: Assessment = 3, Background (history) = 2, Total = 5
4. Respondent 23: Assessment = 3, Background (history) = 2, Total = 5
5. Respondent 3: Assessment = 3, Background (history) = 3, Total = 6
6. Respondent 22: Assessment = 2, Background (history) = 3, Total = 5
7. Respondent 19: Assessment = 2, Background (history) = 3, Total = 5
8. Respondent 20: Assessment = 3, Background (history) = 2, Total = 5
9. Respondent 11: Assessment = 3, Background (history) = 3, Total = 6
10. Respondent 14: Assessment = 3, Background (history) = 2, Total = 5
11. Respondent 4: Assessment = 2, Background (history) = 3, Total = 5
12. Respondent 7: Assessment = 2, Background (history) = 2, Total = 4

The respondents with a total score of 5 are:
- Respondent 6
- Respondent 2
- Respondent 23
- Respondent 22
- Respondent 19
- Respondent 20
- Respondent 14
- Respondent 4

Now, we need to find the Identification score for these respondents:
- Respondent 6: Identification = 3
- Respondent 2: Identification = 3
- Respondent 23: Identification = 3
- Respondent 22: Identification = 3
- Respondent 19: Identification = 3
- Respondent 20: Identification = 3
- Respondent 14: Identification = 3
- Respondent 4: Identification = 3

All respondents with a total score of 5 for 'Assessment' and 'Background (history)' have an Identification score of 3. According to the schema, an Identification score of 3 means ""Introduces themselves and information is complete"".

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Recommendation (global rating scale) of the respondent with the highest Background (history) in the 'III - Sepsis' session?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify all respondents who participated in the 'III - Sepsis' session.
2. Among these respondents, find the one with the highest Background (history) score.
3. Report the Recommendation (global rating scale) of this respondent.

From the 'responses' section, the respondents who participated in the 'III - Sepsis' session are:

- Respondent 15
- Respondent 4
- Respondent 3
- Respondent 7

Their Background (history) scores are:
- Respondent 15: 2
- Respondent 4: 3
- Respondent 3: 3
- Respondent 7: 2

The respondents with the highest Background (history) score are Respondent 4 and Respondent 3, both with a score of 3.

Now, we need to find the Recommendation (global rating scale) for both of these respondents:
- Respondent 4: 2
- Respondent 3: 3

Since the question asks for the Recommendation (global rating scale) of the respondent with the highest Background (history) in the 'III - Sepsis' session, and both Respondent 4 and Respondent 3 have the highest score, we should ideally report both. However, the task seems to imply a singular answer, and based on the provided instructions, we should focus on the numerical value that corresponds to the global rating scale. 

Given the rubric for Recommendation (global rating scale), the values are:
- 0 = Not at all confident
- 1 = Confident but required extended questioning
- 2 = Confident but required some further questioning
- 3 = Confident and required little or no questioning

Between Respondent 4 and Respondent 3, Respondent 3 has the higher Recommendation (global rating scale) value, which is 3. This corresponds to ""Confident and required little or no questioning"".

The final answer is: Confident and required little or no questioning",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Situation of the respondent with the highest Recommendation (clear recommendation) in the 'II - Anaphylaxsis' session?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify all respondents who participated in the 'II - Anaphylaxsis' session.
2. Among these respondents, find the one with the highest Recommendation (clear recommendation).
3. Report the Situation of this respondent.

From the 'responses' section, we can see that there are two respondents who participated in the 'II - Anaphylaxsis' or 'II (Anaphylaxsis)' session: Respondent 9 and Respondent 5, and also Respondent 23 who participated in 'II-Anaphylaxsis'.

Respondent 9:
- SessionName: II (Anaphylaxsis)
- Recommendation (clear recommendation): 3

Respondent 5:
- SessionName: II - Anaphylaxsis
- Recommendation (clear recommendation): 2

Respondent 23:
- SessionName: II-Anaphylaxsis
- Recommendation (clear recommendation): 3

Both Respondent 9 and Respondent 23 have the highest Recommendation (clear recommendation) with a score of 3. 

For Respondent 9:
- Situation: 3

For Respondent 23:
- Situation: 3

Since both respondents have the same high recommendation score and the same situation score, we can report the situation as the same for both, which corresponds to the text in the schema: ""Identifies and prioritizes the main problem(s) unprompted"".

The final answer is: Identifies and prioritizes the main problem(s) unprompted",True

From the responses, we can see that there are two respondents who participated in the 'II (Anaphylaxsis)' session: Respondent 9 and Respondent 5.

Respondent 9 has a Recommendation (global rating scale) of 2.
Respondent 5 has a Recommendation (global rating scale) of 3.

Since 3 is higher than 2, Respondent 5 has the highest Recommendation (global rating scale) in the 'II (Anaphylaxsis)' session.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Recommendation (global rating scale) of the respondent whose total score for 'Background (examination)' and 'Assessment' was exactly 5?
</task>","To find the respondent whose total score for 'Background (examination)' and 'Assessment' was exactly 5, we need to look through the responses and calculate this total for each respondent.

The relevant scores are:
- Background (examination): [Rubric: 0 = Observations are omitted or irrelevant, 1 = Observations reported but frequent clarification needed, 2 = Observations reported with few further questions needed, 3 = Comprehensive focused examination/observations]
- Assessment: [Rubric: 0 = No logical assessment, 1 = Assessment only after extended questioning, 2 = Assessment after minimal questioning, 3 = Comprehensive logical assessment without questioning]

We are looking for a combination that adds up to 5. Possible combinations are (2,3), (3,2).

Let's examine the responses:

1. Respondent 18: Background (examination) = 2, Assessment = 3. Total = 5.
2. Respondent 2: Background (examination) = 3, Assessment = 3. Total = 6.
3. Respondent 12: Background (examination) = 3, Assessment = 2. Total = 5.
4. Respondent 19: Background (examination) = 3, Assessment = 2. Total = 5.
5. Respondent 23: Background (examination) = 2, Assessment = 3. Total = 5.
6. Respondent 5: Background (examination) = 3, Assessment = 3. Total = 6.
7. Respondent 14: Background (examination) = 2, Assessment = 3. Total = 5.
8. Respondent 20: Background (examination) = -1, Assessment = 3. Total = 2.
9. Respondent 1: Background (examination) = 2, Assessment = 3. Total = 5.

Respondents 18, 12, 19, 23, 14, and 1 have a total score of 5 for 'Background (examination)' and 'Assessment'.

Now, we need to find the Recommendation (global rating scale) for these respondents:
- Respondent 18: Recommendation (global rating scale) = 2
- Respondent 12: Recommendation (global rating scale) = 3
- Respondent 19: Recommendation (global rating scale) = 3
- Respondent 23: Recommendation (global rating scale) = 3
- Respondent 14: Recommendation (global rating scale) = 2
- Respondent 1: Recommendation (global rating scale) = 2

According to the schema, the Recommendation (global rating scale) rubric is:
[Rubric: 0 = Not at all confident, 1 = Confident but required extended questioning, 2 = Confident but required some further questioning, 3 = Confident and required little or no questioning]

Thus, the Recommendation (global rating scale) values in text form for the respondents with a total score of 5 are:
- Confident but required some further questioning (Respondents 18, 14, 1)
- Confident and required little or no questioning (Respondents 12, 19, 23)

Since the task does not specify which respondent to choose if there are multiple, and given the instruction to provide a human-readable value, it seems the task implies finding a unique answer or set of answers based on the given criteria. However, the provided instructions and the nature of the question suggest that we should identify the scale level rather than list all possible text outcomes. Given this, the most direct interpretation of the task, focusing on the ""output must be the human-readable value"" and the nature of the question asked, would suggest listing the unique human-readable values corresponding to the scale levels found:

Confident but required some further questioning, Confident and required little or no questioning. 

However, following the format strictly as requested and considering the primary goal is to provide a concise answer based on the data analysis, the best approach would be to directly state the levels as they correspond to the found scores without additional interpretation, which aligns with providing a ""human-readable value"" for the scale levels identified:

2, 3 

Given the constraints of the format and the goal of providing a clear, direct answer based on the analysis, and recognizing the potential for multiple interpretations of the task's requirements, the most fitting response that adheres to the instructions and provides a clear, concise answer based on the analysis would be to directly reference the scale levels as identified. 

Therefore, focusing on the direct output of human-readable values as per the scale:

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the Recommendation (global rating scale) of the respondent from the 'II-Anaphylaxsis' session whose Recommendation (global rating scale) is higher than the average Recommendation (global rating scale) for all sessions on '2025-03-14'?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average Recommendation (global rating scale) for all sessions on '2025-03-14'. Then, we identify the respondent from the 'II-Anaphylaxsis' session and check if their Recommendation (global rating scale) is higher than this average. Finally, we provide the Recommendation (global rating scale) of this respondent.

1. **Calculate the average Recommendation (global rating scale) for all sessions on '2025-03-14':**

Respondents with sessions on '2025-03-14' are:
- Respondent 2: SessionName = MI, Recommendation (global rating scale) = 1
- Respondent 23: SessionName = II-Anaphylaxsis, Recommendation (global rating scale) = 3
- Respondent 7: SessionName = III-Sepsis, Recommendation (global rating scale) = 2
- Respondent 14: SessionName = IV-Hypoglycemia, Recommendation (global rating scale) = 2
- Respondent 10: SessionName = (MI)-VT, Recommendation (global rating scale) = 2

Average Recommendation (global rating scale) = (1 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 2) / 5 = 10 / 5 = 2

2. **Identify the respondent from the 'II-Anaphylaxsis' session:**

The respondent from the 'II-Anaphylaxsis' session is Respondent 23, with a Recommendation (global rating scale) of 3.

3. **Check if the Recommendation (global rating scale) of Respondent 23 is higher than the average:**

Since 3 (Respondent 23's Recommendation) is indeed higher than 2 (the average Recommendation for '2025-03-14' sessions), we proceed to provide the Recommendation (global rating scale) of Respondent 23.

According to the schema, a Recommendation (global rating scale) of 3 corresponds to ""Confident and required little or no questioning"".

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Recommendation (global rating scale) of the respondent with the highest Identification in the 'I-VF' session?
</task>","To answer this question, we first need to identify the respondent with the highest Identification in the 'I-VF' session and then find their Recommendation (global rating scale).

From the responses section, we find that Respondent 13 is the one who participated in the 'I-VF' session.

According to the 'questions' schema, the Recommendation (global rating scale) is defined as:
9. Recommendation (global rating scale): Global Rating Scale (GRS) - How confident am I that I received an accurate picture of the patient? [Rubric: 0 = Not at all confident, 1 = Confident but required extended questioning, 2 = Confident but required some further questioning, 3 = Confident and required little or no questioning]

The Recommendation (global rating scale) for Respondent 13 is 2, which corresponds to ""Confident but required some further questioning"". 

The final answer is: Confident but required some further questioning",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Background (examination) of the respondent whose score for 'Identification' was 3 and score for 'Background (history)' was 3?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to find the respondent whose score for 'Identification' was 3 and score for 'Background (history)' was 3, and then determine their 'Background (examination)' score.

After reviewing the responses, we find that Respondent 19 and Respondent 22 have scores of 3 for both 'Identification' and 'Background (history)'. 

Respondent 19 has a 'Background (examination)' score of 3.
Respondent 11 also has a score of 3 for 'Identification' and 'Background (history)' and a 'Background (examination)' score of 3.

Therefore, the 'Background (examination)' of the respondents whose score for 'Identification' was 3 and score for 'Background (history)' was 3 is 3, which according to the schema means ""Comprehensive focused examination/observations"". 

The final answer is: Comprehensive focused examination/observations",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Recommendation (global rating scale) of the respondent from the 'II - Anaphylaxsis' session whose Background (history) is higher than the average Background (history) for all sessions on '2025-05-04'?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average Background (history) for all sessions on '2025-05-04'. Then, we identify the respondent from the 'II - Anaphylaxsis' session with a Background (history) score higher than this average. Finally, we determine the Recommendation (global rating scale) for this respondent.

1. **Calculate the average Background (history) for all sessions on '2025-05-04':**

Respondents with sessions on '2025-05-04' are Respondent 5, Respondent 18. 

- Respondent 5: Background (history) = 3
- Respondent 18: Background (history) = 2

Average Background (history) = (3 + 2) / 2 = 2.5

2. **Identify the respondent from the 'II - Anaphylaxsis' session with a Background (history) score higher than the average:**

The average Background (history) is 2.5. Respondent 5 has a Background (history) of 3, which is higher than 2.5.

3. **Determine the Recommendation (global rating scale) for this respondent:**

Respondent 5's Recommendation (global rating scale) = 3

According to the schema, a score of 3 in the Recommendation (global rating scale) corresponds to ""Confident and required little or no questioning"".

The final answer is: Confident and required little or no questioning",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Recommendation (clear recommendation) of the respondent from the 'IV (VT)' session whose Situation is higher than the average Situation for all sessions on '2025-05-02'?
</task>","To answer this question, we first need to calculate the average Situation score for all sessions on '2025-05-02'. Then, we identify the respondent from the 'IV (VT)' session with a Situation score higher than this average and report their Recommendation (clear recommendation).

1. **Calculate the average Situation score for '2025-05-02' sessions:**

Respondents with sessions on '2025-05-02' are:
- Respondent 1: Situation = 2
- Respondent 16: Situation = 3
- Respondent 20: Situation = 3

Average Situation score = (2 + 3 + 3) / 3 = 8 / 3 = 2.67

2. **Identify the 'IV (VT)' session respondent with a Situation score higher than the average:**

The average Situation score is 2.67. We look for respondents with SessionName 'IV (VT)' and Situation score higher than 2.67:
- Respondent 20 has SessionName 'IV (VT)' and Situation = 3, which is higher than 2.67.

3. **Report the Recommendation (clear recommendation) for this respondent:**

Respondent 20's Recommendation (clear recommendation) = 2

According to the schema, Recommendation (clear recommendation) is scored as:
- 0 = No recommendation
- 1 = Clear recommendation only after extended questioning
- 2 = Clear recommendation after minimal questioning
- 3 = Clear comprehensive recommendation without questioning

Therefore, the Recommendation (clear recommendation) for Respondent 20 is ""Clear recommendation after minimal questioning"".",True
