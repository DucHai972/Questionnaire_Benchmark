<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Situation of respondent '11'?
</task>","To answer this question, we first need to locate the respondent with the ID '11' in the 'responses' section of the data. Then, we look for the ""Situation"" value associated with this respondent.

In the provided data, the respondent '11' has the following answers:

```
{
  ""respondent"": ""11"",
  ""answers"": {
    ""Date"": ""2025-04-04"",

    ""Recommendation (clear recommendation)"": 3,
    ""Recommendation (global rating scale)"": 3,
    ""Comments"": ""Clear communication and handover""
  }
}
```

According to the 'questions' schema, the ""Situation"" field is defined as:

```
""Situation"": ""Identifies the main problem(s). [Rubric: 0 = Unable to identify the main problem(s), 1 = Identifies the main problem(s) after extended prompting, 2 = Identifies the main problem(s) with fewer prompts needed, 3 = Identifies and prioritizes the main problem(s) unprompted]"",
```

Given that respondent '11' has a ""Situation"" score of 3, we refer back to the schema to understand what this score means. A score of 3 corresponds to ""Identifies and prioritizes the main problem(s) unprompted"".

Therefore, the Situation of respondent '11' is: Identifies and prioritizes the main problem(s) unprompted.",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

What is the Recommendation (global rating scale) of the respondent from the 'MI' session on '2025-04-04'?
</task>","To answer this question, we first need to find the respondent who attended the 'MI' session on '2025-04-04'. Then, we look at their answer for the ""Recommendation (global rating scale)"" question.

From the 'responses' section, we find the respondent with the session 'MI' and date '2025-04-04':

The ""Recommendation (global rating scale)"" is given a score of 1. According to the 'questions' schema, the rubric for ""Recommendation (global rating scale)"" is:

""[Rubric: 0 = Not at all confident, 1 = Confident but required extended questioning, 2 = Confident but required some further questioning, 3 = Confident and required little or no questioning]""

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Background (examination) of the respondent from the 'II - Anaphylaxsis' session on '2025-05-04'?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to find the respondent who answered the 'II - Anaphylaxsis' session on '2025-05-04' and then find their Background (examination) score.

From the 'responses' section, we can see that there are two respondents who answered the 'II - Anaphylaxsis' session on '2025-05-04': respondent 5 and respondent 9.

Respondent 5's Background (examination) score is 3, and respondent 9's Background (examination) score is 2.

According to the 'questions' schema, the Background (examination) scores are defined as follows:
- 0 = Observations are omitted or irrelevant
- 1 = Observations reported but frequent clarification needed
- 2 = Observations reported with few further questions needed
- 3 = Comprehensive focused examination/observations

Since the question asks for the Background (examination) of the respondent, we need to map the score to the corresponding option text. 

For respondent 5, the score is 3, which corresponds to ""Comprehensive focused examination/observations"".
For respondent 9, the score is 2, which corresponds to ""Observations reported with few further questions needed"".

However, the question does not specify which respondent to choose, so based on the provided instructions, we should provide the answer for each respondent. But since the format requires a single final answer and it seems the instruction might be misunderstood in the context of providing a single answer, I will follow the format strictly and provide an answer based on the first matching respondent, which is a common approach when dealing with such data:

The final answer is: Observations reported with few further questions needed",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Background (history) of the respondent from the '(MI)-VT' session on '2025-03-14'?
</task>","To answer this question, we first need to identify the respondent who participated in the '(MI)-VT' session on '2025-03-14'. Then, we will look up their 'Background (history)' score.

From the 'responses' section, we find the respondent who matches the given session and date:

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Recommendation (global rating scale) of the respondent from the 'IV (VT)' session on '2025-05-02'?
</task>","To answer this question, we first need to identify the respondent who participated in the 'IV (VT)' session on '2025-05-02'. Then, we will look up their Recommendation (global rating scale) response.

From the 'responses' section, we find the respondent who matches the session 'IV (VT)' and the date '2025-05-02':

```

    ""SessionName"": ""IV (VT)"",
    ...
    ""Recommendation (global rating scale)"": 3,
    ...
  }
}
```

According to the 'questions' schema, the Recommendation (global rating scale) is defined as:

""Global Rating Scale (GRS) - How confident am I that I received an accurate picture of the patient? [Rubric: 0 = Not at all confident, 1 = Confident but required extended questioning, 2 = Confident but required some further questioning, 3 = Confident and required little or no questioning]""

The respondent's answer for Recommendation (global rating scale) is 3, which corresponds to ""Confident and required little or no questioning"".

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Assessment of the respondent with the highest Recommendation (global rating scale) in the 'IV-Hypoglycemia' session?
</task>","To answer this question, we first need to identify the respondent with the highest Recommendation (global rating scale) in the 'IV-Hypoglycemia' session. 

Looking through the 'responses' section, we find that the session 'IV-Hypoglycemia' is associated with respondent ""14"". The Recommendation (global rating scale) for this respondent is 2.

Now, we need to find the Assessment of this respondent. According to the data, the Assessment of respondent ""14"" is 3.

Therefore, the Assessment of the respondent with the highest Recommendation (global rating scale) in the 'IV-Hypoglycemia' session is: Comprehensive logical assessment without questioning.",True

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Background (history) of the respondent whose total score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and 'Assessment' was exactly 4?
</task>","To find the respondent whose total score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and 'Assessment' was exactly 4, we need to look through the responses and calculate this total for each respondent.

The possible combinations that result in a total score of 4 are:
- 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' = 2 and 'Assessment' = 2
- 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' = 1 and 'Assessment' = 3
- 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' = 3 and 'Assessment' = 1

Let's examine the responses:

1. Respondent ""8"":
   - 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' = 2
   - 'Assessment' = 2
   Total = 4
   - 'Background (history)' = 3

2. Respondent ""6"":
   - 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' = 2
   - 'Assessment' = 2
   Total = 4
   - 'Background (history)' = 3

3. Respondent ""14"":
   - 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' = 1
   - 'Assessment' = 3
   Total = 4
   - 'Background (history)' = 2

4. Respondent ""16"":
   - 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' = 2
   - 'Assessment' = 3
   Total = 5 (does not match)

5. Respondent ""20"":
   - 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' = 2
   - 'Assessment' = 3
   Total = 5 (does not match)

6. Respondent ""7"":
   - 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' = 2
   - 'Assessment' = 2
   Total = 4
   - 'Background (history)' = 2

The respondents with a total score of 4 are ""8"", ""6"", ""14"", and ""7"". 

For respondent ""8"" and ""6"", 'Background (history)' = 3, which according to the schema means ""Comprehensive focused history"".
For respondent ""14"" and ""7"", 'Background (history)' = 2, which according to the schema means ""Relevant history with few further questions needed"".

Since the task is asking for the Background (history) of the respondent with this specific total score, and there are multiple respondents with this score but different 'Background (history)' scores, the question as posed does not have a single answer based on the provided data. However, following the format strictly as requested and focusing on the first matching respondent:

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Identification of the respondent whose score for 'Situation' was 3 and score for 'Assessment' was 3?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to find the respondent whose score for 'Situation' was 3 and score for 'Assessment' was 3.

From the 'responses' section, we can see that there are several respondents who meet this criteria:

- Respondent 5: Situation = 3, Assessment = 3
- Respondent 18: Situation = 3, Assessment = 3
- Respondent 11: Situation = 3, Assessment = 3
- Respondent 1: Situation = 2, Assessment = 3 (does not meet the criteria)
- Respondent 15: Situation = 3, Assessment = 2 (does not meet the criteria)

The 'Identification' score for these respondents are:
- Respondent 5: Identification = 3
- Respondent 18: Identification = 3
- Respondent 11: Identification = 3

According to the 'questions' schema, an 'Identification' score of 3 means ""Introduces themselves and information is complete"".

Therefore, the Identification of the respondents whose score for 'Situation' was 3 and score for 'Assessment' was 3 is: Introduces themselves and information is complete.",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Identification of the respondent whose total score for 'Assessment' and 'Background (history)' was exactly 5?
</task>","To find the Identification of the respondent whose total score for 'Assessment' and 'Background (history)' was exactly 5, we need to examine each respondent's answers in the 'responses' section and calculate the total score for these two categories. We are looking for a respondent with a total score of 5.

Let's calculate the total score for 'Assessment' and 'Background (history)' for each respondent:

1. Respondent 17: Assessment = 3, Background (history) = 3, Total = 6
2. Respondent 6: Assessment = 2, Background (history) = 3, Total = 5
3. Respondent 2: Assessment = 3, Background (history) = 2, Total = 5
4. Respondent 23: Assessment = 3, Background (history) = 2, Total = 5
5. Respondent 3: Assessment = 3, Background (history) = 3, Total = 6
6. Respondent 22: Assessment = 2, Background (history) = 3, Total = 5
7. Respondent 19: Assessment = 2, Background (history) = 3, Total = 5
8. Respondent 20: Assessment = 3, Background (history) = 2, Total = 5
9. Respondent 11: Assessment = 3, Background (history) = 3, Total = 6
10. Respondent 14: Assessment = 3, Background (history) = 2, Total = 5
11. Respondent 4: Assessment = 2, Background (history) = 3, Total = 5
12. Respondent 7: Assessment = 2, Background (history) = 2, Total = 4

The respondents with a total score of exactly 5 are: 6, 2, 23, 22, 19, 20, 14, and 4.

Now, we need to find the Identification score for these respondents:

- Respondent 6: Identification = 3
- Respondent 2: Identification = 3
- Respondent 23: Identification = 3
- Respondent 22: Identification = 3
- Respondent 19: Identification = 3
- Respondent 20: Identification = 3
- Respondent 14: Identification = 3
- Respondent 4: Identification = 3

All of these respondents have an Identification score of 3, which corresponds to ""Introduces themselves and information is complete"" according to the schema.

The final answer is: Introduces themselves and information is complete",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Assessment of the respondent whose score for 'Background (history)' was 2 and score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' was 2?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to find the respondent whose score for 'Background (history)' was 2 and score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' was 2, and then determine their Assessment score.

After analyzing the 'responses' section, we found the following respondents who match the given criteria:

- Respondent 7: 'Background (history)' = 2, 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' = 2
- Respondent 13: 'Background (history)' = 2, 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' = 2
- Respondent 10: 'Background (history)' = 2, 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' = 2
- Respondent 8: 'Background (history)' = 3, 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' = 2 (does not match)
- Respondent 9: 'Background (history)' = 2, 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' = 3 (does not match)
- Respondent 20: 'Background (history)' = 2, 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' = 2
- Respondent 6: 'Background (history)' = 3, 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' = 2 (does not match)

The Assessment scores for the matching respondents are:
- Respondent 7: Assessment = 2
- Respondent 13: Assessment = 2
- Respondent 10: Assessment = 2
- Respondent 20: Assessment = 3

Since the question asks for the Assessment of the respondent whose score for 'Background (history)' was 2 and score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' was 2, and there are multiple respondents with these scores, we need to check if the question implies a single respondent or if it's asking for a list. However, given the format and the usual expectation of such questions, it seems the task is to identify a specific or any matching respondent's Assessment score based on the criteria provided.

Given the information and the format required for the answer, it seems we are to provide the Assessment score directly related to the criteria without implying a need for a list of all matching respondents' scores. 

Thus, based on the first matching respondent (to follow the format strictly and provide a single answer as the output rules suggest), the Assessment score is 2. 

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the Recommendation (global rating scale) of the respondent with the highest Background (history) in the 'III - Sepsis' session?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify all respondents who participated in the 'III - Sepsis' session.
2. Among these respondents, find the one with the highest Background (history) score.
3. Report the Recommendation (global rating scale) of this respondent.

From the 'responses' section, we can see that there are three respondents who participated in the 'III - Sepsis' session: respondents 15, 4, and 3, and respondent 7.

Here are their Background (history) scores:
- Respondent 15: 2
- Respondent 4: 3
- Respondent 3: 3
- Respondent 7: 2

The highest Background (history) score is 3, which is shared by respondents 4 and 3.

Now, we need to find the Recommendation (global rating scale) for these two respondents:
- Respondent 4: 2
- Respondent 3: 3

Since the question asks for the Recommendation (global rating scale) of the respondent with the highest Background (history), and both respondents 4 and 3 have the same highest score, we should look at the question's requirements again. It does not specify what to do in the case of a tie, so we will provide the Recommendation (global rating scale) for both respondents who are tied for the highest Background (history) score. However, following the format strictly as requested, I will provide the answer based on the first matching respondent's data as that seems to be the implied instruction, given the format does not accommodate multiple answers or explanations.

Given respondent 4's data is listed first among the tied respondents in the provided data, their Recommendation (global rating scale) is 2. According to the schema, a score of 2 corresponds to ""Confident but required some further questioning"".

The final answer is: Confident but required some further questioning",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Identification of the respondent whose score for 'Background (history)' was 2 and score for 'Assessment' was 3?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to find the respondent whose score for 'Background (history)' was 2 and score for 'Assessment' was 3.

Looking at the 'responses' section, we can see that there are two respondents who meet this criteria:

- Respondent ""18"" has a score of 2 for 'Background (history)' and a score of 3 for 'Assessment'.
- Respondent ""17"" has a score of 3 for 'Background (history)' and a score of 3 for 'Assessment', so this respondent does not meet the criteria.
- Respondent ""2"" has a score of 2 for 'Background (history)' and a score of 3 for 'Assessment', so this respondent meets the criteria.

According to the 'questions' schema, the 'Identification' field is defined as ""Identification of self, role, and patient. [Rubric: 0 = Requires direct prompting, 1 = Introduces themselves but only after a hint, 2 = Introduces themselves but information is incomplete, 3 = Introduces themselves and information is complete]"".

For respondent ""18"", the score for 'Identification' is 3, which corresponds to ""Introduces themselves and information is complete"".
For respondent ""2"", the score for 'Identification' is 3, which corresponds to ""Introduces themselves and information is complete"".

Therefore, the Identification of the respondents whose score for 'Background (history)' was 2 and score for 'Assessment' was 3 is ""Introduces themselves and information is complete"" for both respondents ""18"" and ""2"".",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Situation of the respondent with the highest Recommendation (clear recommendation) in the 'II - Anaphylaxsis' session?
</task>","To answer this question, we first need to identify the respondents who participated in the 'II - Anaphylaxsis' session, and then find the one with the highest Recommendation (clear recommendation) score. Finally, we will determine the Situation score of this respondent.

From the 'responses' section, we can see that there are two respondents who participated in the 'II - Anaphylaxsis' or similarly named sessions:

1. Respondent ""9"" with SessionName ""II (Anaphylaxsis)"" and Recommendation (clear recommendation) score of 3.
2. Respondent ""5"" with SessionName ""II - Anaphylaxsis"" and Recommendation (clear recommendation) score of 2.
3. Respondent ""23"" with SessionName ""II-Anaphylaxsis"" and Recommendation (clear recommendation) score of 3.

Both respondents ""9"" and ""23"" have the highest Recommendation (clear recommendation) score of 3. 

For respondent ""9"", the Situation score is 3.
For respondent ""23"", the Situation score is 3.

Since both respondents have the same highest Recommendation (clear recommendation) score and the same Situation score, we can report either as the answer. Following the instruction to provide a single answer, we'll choose one based on the first occurrence in the data provided:

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Recommendation (global rating scale) of the respondent with the highest Recommendation (global rating scale) in the 'II (Anaphylaxsis)' session?
</task>","To answer this question, we first need to identify all respondents who participated in the 'II (Anaphylaxsis)' session, and then find the one with the highest Recommendation (global rating scale).

From the 'responses' section, we can see that there are two respondents who participated in the 'II (Anaphylaxsis)' session: respondent ""9"" and respondent ""5"". 

Respondent ""9"" has a Recommendation (global rating scale) of 2.
Respondent ""5"" has a Recommendation (global rating scale) of 3.

Since 3 is higher than 2, respondent ""5"" has the highest Recommendation (global rating scale). 

According to the 'questions' schema, a Recommendation (global rating scale) of 3 corresponds to ""Confident and required little or no questioning"".

The final answer is: Confident and required little or no questioning",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Recommendation (global rating scale) of the respondent whose total score for 'Background (examination)' and 'Assessment' was exactly 5?
</task>","To find the respondent whose total score for 'Background (examination)' and 'Assessment' was exactly 5, we need to look through the responses and calculate this total for each respondent.

The possible combinations that result in a total of 5 are:
- 'Background (examination)' = 2 and 'Assessment' = 3
- 'Background (examination)' = 3 and 'Assessment' = 2

Let's examine the responses:

1. Respondent ""18"": 'Background (examination)' = 2, 'Assessment' = 3. Total = 5.
2. Respondent ""2"": 'Background (examination)' = 3, 'Assessment' = 3. Total = 6.
3. Respondent ""12"": 'Background (examination)' = 3, 'Assessment' = 2. Total = 5.
4. Respondent ""19"": 'Background (examination)' = 3, 'Assessment' = 2. Total = 5.
5. Respondent ""23"": 'Background (examination)' = 2, 'Assessment' = 3. Total = 5.
6. Respondent ""5"": 'Background (examination)' = 3, 'Assessment' = 3. Total = 6.
7. Respondent ""14"": 'Background (examination)' = 2, 'Assessment' = 3. Total = 5.
8. Respondent ""20"": 'Background (examination)' = -1, 'Assessment' = 3. Total = 2.
9. Respondent ""1"": 'Background (examination)' = 2, 'Assessment' = 3. Total = 5.

The respondents with a total score of exactly 5 are ""18"", ""12"", ""19"", ""23"", ""14"", and ""1"".

Now, we need to find the Recommendation (global rating scale) for these respondents:
- Respondent ""18"": Recommendation (global rating scale) = 2
- Respondent ""12"": Recommendation (global rating scale) = 3
- Respondent ""19"": Recommendation (global rating scale) = 3
- Respondent ""23"": Recommendation (global rating scale) = 3
- Respondent ""14"": Recommendation (global rating scale) = 2
- Respondent ""1"": Recommendation (global rating scale) = 2

According to the schema, the Recommendation (global rating scale) is defined as:
""[Rubric: 0 = Not at all confident, 1 = Confident but required extended questioning, 2 = Confident but required some further questioning, 3 = Confident and required little or no questioning]""

So, the Recommendation (global rating scale) values in text form are:
- For respondent ""18"": Confident but required some further questioning
- For respondent ""12"": Confident and required little or no questioning
- For respondent ""19"": Confident and required little or no questioning
- For respondent ""23"": Confident and required little or no questioning
- For respondent ""14"": Confident but required some further questioning
- For respondent ""1"": Confident but required some further questioning

Since the task does not specify which respondent to choose if there are multiple, and given the instruction to provide a direct and concise answer, it seems the task implies finding a single value or a common value among the matching respondents. However, the provided instructions do not explicitly cover how to handle multiple correct answers based on the given criteria. 

Given the constraint to follow the format to the letter and the ambiguity in the task regarding multiple respondents, the most straightforward interpretation is to select one of the values that match the criteria, acknowledging that this does not fully address the potential for multiple correct answers as defined by the task.

Therefore, selecting one of the matching values:

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Recommendation (global rating scale) of the respondent from the 'II-Anaphylaxsis' session whose Recommendation (global rating scale) is higher than the average Recommendation (global rating scale) for all sessions on '2025-03-14'?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average Recommendation (global rating scale) for all sessions on '2025-03-14'. Then, we identify the respondent from the 'II-Anaphylaxsis' session whose Recommendation (global rating scale) is higher than this average.

1. **Calculate the average Recommendation (global rating scale) for '2025-03-14' sessions:**

From the data, the sessions on '2025-03-14' are:

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Recommendation (global rating scale) of the respondent with the highest Identification in the 'I-VF' session?
</task>","To answer this question, we first need to identify the respondent with the highest Identification score in the 'I-VF' session. 

Looking through the responses, we find one respondent with the session name 'I-VF':

- Respondent ""13"" has a session name of ""I-VF"" and an Identification score of 3.

Since there's only one respondent for the 'I-VF' session, this respondent has the highest Identification score by default.

Now, we look at the Recommendation (global rating scale) for this respondent:

- Respondent ""13"" has a Recommendation (global rating scale) of 2.

According to the 'questions' schema, a score of 2 for Recommendation (global rating scale) corresponds to ""Confident but required some further questioning"".

Therefore, the Recommendation (global rating scale) of the respondent with the highest Identification in the 'I-VF' session is ""Confident but required some further questioning"".",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Background (history) of the respondent whose score for 'Background (history)' was 2 and score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' was 2?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to find the respondent whose score for 'Background (history)' was 2 and score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' was 2, and then provide their answer for 'Background (history)'.


After analyzing the data, we found that there are multiple respondents who meet this condition. However, the 'Background (history)' field is a rubric-scored field, not an open-ended field. The score of 2 corresponds to ""Relevant history with few further questions needed"" according to the schema.


The respondents who meet this condition are:


- Respondent 10
- Respondent 8
- Respondent 7
- Respondent 13
- Respondent 21


However, since 'Background (history)' is not an open-ended field, we cannot provide a specific text value for each respondent's 'Background (history)'. Instead, we can only provide the corresponding rubric description for the score.


The answer is: Relevant history with few further questions needed.",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Recommendation (clear recommendation) of the respondent whose total score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and 'Situation' was exactly 4?
</task>","To find the respondent whose total score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and 'Situation' was exactly 4, we need to look through the responses and calculate this total for each respondent.

The possible combinations that result in a total score of 4 are:
- 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' = 3 and 'Situation' = 1
- 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' = 2 and 'Situation' = 2
- 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' = 1 and 'Situation' = 3

Let's examine the responses:

1. Respondent ""12"": 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' = 3, 'Situation' = 3. Total = 6.
2. Respondent ""21"": 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' = 3, 'Situation' = 2. Total = 5.
3. Respondent ""17"": 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' = 3, 'Situation' = 3. Total = 6.
4. Respondent ""13"": 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' = 2, 'Situation' = 3. Total = 5.
5. Respondent ""18"": 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' = 2, 'Situation' = 3. Total = 5.
6. Respondent ""11"": 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' = 3, 'Situation' = 3. Total = 6.
7. Respondent ""1"": 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' = 2, 'Situation' = 2. Total = 4.
8. Respondent ""4"": 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' = 2, 'Situation' = 3. Total = 5.
9. Respondent ""15"": 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' = 2, 'Situation' = 3. Total = 5.
10. Respondent ""5"": 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' = 2, 'Situation' = 3. Total = 5.

Respondent ""1"" has a total score of 4 for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and 'Situation'. The 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' for respondent ""1"" is 2.

According to the schema, 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' is scored as follows: 
""[Rubric: 0 = No recommendation, 1 = Clear recommendation only after extended questioning, 2 = Clear recommendation after minimal questioning, 3 = Clear comprehensive recommendation without questioning]"".

Therefore, the Recommendation (clear recommendation) of the respondent whose total score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and 'Situation' was exactly 4 is: Clear recommendation after minimal questioning.",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Recommendation (global rating scale) of the respondent from the 'II - Anaphylaxsis' session whose Background (history) is higher than the average Background (history) for all sessions on '2025-05-04'?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average Background (history) for all sessions on '2025-05-04'. Then, we identify the respondent from the 'II - Anaphylaxsis' session with a Background (history) score higher than this average. Finally, we determine the Recommendation (global rating scale) for this respondent.

1. **Calculate the average Background (history) for all sessions on '2025-05-04':**

From the data, the sessions on '2025-05-04' are:
- Respondent ""18"" with Background (history) = 2
- Respondent ""5"" with Background (history) = 3
- Respondent ""22"" is not on '2025-05-04', so we exclude this respondent.

Average Background (history) = (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5

2. **Identify the respondent from the 'II - Anaphylaxsis' session with a Background (history) higher than the average:**

The respondent ""5"" has a Background (history) of 3, which is higher than the average of 2.5, and is from the 'II - Anaphylaxsis' session.

3. **Determine the Recommendation (global rating scale) for this respondent:**

Respondent ""5"" has a Recommendation (global rating scale) of 3.

According to the schema, a Recommendation (global rating scale) of 3 corresponds to ""Confident and required little or no questioning"".

The final answer is: Confident and required little or no questioning",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Recommendation (clear recommendation) of the respondent from the 'IV (VT)' session whose Situation is higher than the average Situation for all sessions on '2025-05-02'?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the average Situation score for all sessions on '2025-05-02'**:
   - Identify all respondents who had a session on '2025-05-02'.
   - Sum up their Situation scores.
   - Divide the sum by the number of respondents to get the average Situation score.

2. **Identify the respondent(s) from the 'IV (VT)' session on any date whose Situation score is higher than the calculated average**:
   - Find the respondent(s) with the session name 'IV (VT)'.
   - Check if their Situation score is higher than the average calculated in step 1.

3. **Determine the Recommendation (clear recommendation) for the identified respondent(s)**:
   - Look up the Recommendation (clear recommendation) score for the respondent(s) identified in step 2.
   - Map the score to the corresponding text description from the 'questions' schema.

Let's execute these steps based on the provided data:

### Step 1: Calculate the average Situation score for '2025-05-02'

Respondents on '2025-05-02' are:
- Respondent ""1"" with Situation score 2.
- Respondent ""16"" with Situation score 3.
- Respondent ""20"" with Situation score 3.

Average Situation score = (2 + 3 + 3) / 3 = 8 / 3 = 2.67

### Step 2: Identify respondents from 'IV (VT)' with Situation higher than average

Respondents with 'IV (VT)' session are:
- Respondent ""18"" with Situation score 3 (session date '2025-05-04').
- Respondent ""22"" with Situation score 3 (session date '2025-05-16').
- Respondent ""20"" with Situation score 3 (session date '2025-05-02').

Since 3 is higher than 2.67, all these respondents qualify. However, the task specifically asks for a respondent from the 'IV (VT)' session whose Situation is higher than the average for sessions on '2025-05-02', which directly points to respondent ""20"" as the most relevant, given the date and session name match the criteria directly.

### Step 3: Determine the Recommendation (clear recommendation)

For respondent ""20"", the Recommendation (clear recommendation) score is 2.

According to the schema, the score 2 maps to ""Clear recommendation after minimal questioning"".

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$",True
