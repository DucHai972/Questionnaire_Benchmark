</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the Recommendation (global rating scale) of the respondent from the 'MI' session on '2025-04-04'?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to find the respondent who participated in the 'MI' session on '2025-04-04' and then determine their Recommendation (global rating scale).

From the provided data, we can see that Respondent 2 participated in the 'MI' session on '2025-04-04'. 

According to the schema, the Recommendation (global rating scale) is scored as follows: 
- 0 = Not at all confident
- 1 = Confident but required extended questioning
- 2 = Confident but required some further questioning
- 3 = Confident and required little or no questioning

Respondent 2's Recommendation (global rating scale) score is 1.

Therefore, the Recommendation (global rating scale) of the respondent from the 'MI' session on '2025-04-04' is Confident but required extended questioning.",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Background (examination) of the respondent from the 'II - Anaphylaxsis' session on '2025-05-04'?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to find the respondent who participated in the 'II - Anaphylaxsis' session on '2025-05-04' and then look at their Background (examination) score.

From the provided data, there are two respondents who match the session 'II - Anaphylaxsis' on '2025-05-04': Respondent 5 and Respondent 9.

Respondent 5 has a Background (examination) score of 3.
Respondent 9 has a Background (examination) score of 2.

According to the schema, the Background (examination) scores are defined as follows:
- 0 = Observations are omitted or irrelevant
- 1 = Observations reported but frequent clarification needed
- 2 = Observations reported with few further questions needed
- 3 = Comprehensive focused examination/observations

Since the question asks for the Background (examination) of the respondent, we need to determine which respondent's data to use. Given that there are two respondents, the question is ambiguous. However, based on the provided instructions to follow the format to the letter and the lack of clarity on how to handle multiple respondents, I will provide the answer for both respondents as the question does not specify which one to choose.

For Respondent 5: Comprehensive focused examination/observations
For Respondent 9: Observations reported with few further questions needed

Given the constraints of the output format which requires a single answer and the ambiguity in the question, it seems there might be an oversight in how the question is framed regarding handling multiple potential answers. However, following the instruction to provide a human-readable value and considering the format requirement, I will select the first matching respondent's answer for consistency:

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").

<task>
What is the Assessment of the respondent with the highest Recommendation (global rating scale) in the 'IV-Hypoglycemia' session?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to find the respondent with the highest Recommendation (global rating scale) in the 'IV-Hypoglycemia' session and then determine their Assessment.

Looking through the responses, we find that Respondent 14 is the one who participated in the 'IV-Hypoglycemia' session. 

Respondent 14's Recommendation (global rating scale) is 2, and their Assessment is 3.

Since there is only one respondent for the 'IV-Hypoglycemia' session, this respondent has the highest Recommendation (global rating scale) by default.

The Assessment of the respondent with the highest Recommendation (global rating scale) in the 'IV-Hypoglycemia' session is therefore 3, which corresponds to ""Comprehensive logical assessment without questioning"" according to the schema. 

The final answer is: Comprehensive logical assessment without questioning",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Background (history) of the respondent whose total score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and 'Assessment' was exactly 4?
</task>","To find the respondent whose total score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and 'Assessment' was exactly 4, we need to look through the responses and calculate this total for each respondent.

The relevant scores are as follows:
- Respondent 8: Recommendation (clear recommendation) = 2, Assessment = 2, Total = 4
- Respondent 6: Recommendation (clear recommendation) = 2, Assessment = 2, Total = 4
- Respondent 14: Recommendation (clear recommendation) = 1, Assessment = 3, Total = 4
- Respondent 16: Recommendation (clear recommendation) = 2, Assessment = 3, Total = 5
- Respondent 20: Recommendation (clear recommendation) = 2, Assessment = 3, Total = 5
- Respondent 7: Recommendation (clear recommendation) = 2, Assessment = 2, Total = 4

The respondents with a total score of exactly 4 are Respondent 8, Respondent 6, Respondent 14, and Respondent 7.

Now, we need to find the Background (history) for these respondents:
- Respondent 8: Background (history) = 3
- Respondent 6: Background (history) = 3
- Respondent 14: Background (history) = 2
- Respondent 7: Background (history) = 2

According to the schema, the scores for Background (history) are:
- 0 = History is unstructured or non-relevant
- 1 = Relevant history but frequent clarification needed
- 2 = Relevant history with few further questions needed
- 3 = Comprehensive focused history

Therefore, the Background (history) for the respondents with a total score of exactly 4 are:
- Respondent 8: Comprehensive focused history
- Respondent 6: Comprehensive focused history
- Respondent 14: Relevant history with few further questions needed
- Respondent 7: Relevant history with few further questions needed

Since the question asks for the Background (history) of the respondent whose total score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and 'Assessment' was exactly 4, and there are multiple respondents with this score, the question's request is ambiguous because it does not specify which respondent to choose. However, following the format strictly as requested and given the nature of the question, it seems the task is to identify the background history for such respondents. Given this, the most direct answer based on the provided data and the requirement to follow the format ""to the letter"" would be to list the unique background histories mentioned for these respondents:

Comprehensive focused history, Relevant history with few further questions needed",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Identification of the respondent whose total score for 'Assessment' and 'Background (history)' was exactly 5?
</task>","To solve this task, we need to find the respondent whose total score for 'Assessment' and 'Background (history)' equals 5.

From the provided data, we can calculate the total score for 'Assessment' and 'Background (history)' for each respondent and then identify the respondent(s) with a total score of 5.

Let's calculate the scores:

- Respondent 17: Assessment (3) + Background (history) (3) = 6
- Respondent 6: Assessment (2) + Background (history) (3) = 5
- Respondent 2: Assessment (3) + Background (history) (2) = 5
- Respondent 23: Assessment (3) + Background (history) (2) = 5
- Respondent 3: Assessment (3) + Background (history) (3) = 6
- Respondent 22: Assessment (2) + Background (history) (3) = 5
- Respondent 19: Assessment (2) + Background (history) (3) = 5
- Respondent 20: Assessment (3) + Background (history) (2) = 5
- Respondent 11: Assessment (3) + Background (history) (3) = 6
- Respondent 14: Assessment (3) + Background (history) (2) = 5
- Respondent 4: Assessment (2) + Background (history) (3) = 5
- Respondent 7: Assessment (2) + Background (history) (3) = 5

The respondents with a total score of 5 for 'Assessment' and 'Background (history)' are Respondent 6, Respondent 2, Respondent 23, Respondent 22, Respondent 19, Respondent 20, Respondent 14, Respondent 4, and Respondent 7.

However, the task asks for the Identification of the respondent, which is scored as follows: 
- 0 = Requires direct prompting
- 1 = Introduces themselves but only after a hint
- 2 = Introduces themselves but information is incomplete
- 3 = Introduces themselves and information is complete

Among the respondents with a total score of 5, we need to find the Identification score. 

- Respondent 6: Identification (3)
- Respondent 2: Identification (3)
- Respondent 23: Identification (3)
- Respondent 22: Identification (3)
- Respondent 19: Identification (3)
- Respondent 20: Identification (3)
- Respondent 14: Identification (3)
- Respondent 4: Identification (3)
- Respondent 7: Identification (3)

All the respondents with a total score of 5 have an Identification score of 3, which means ""Introduces themselves and information is complete"". 

Therefore, the Identification of the respondents whose total score for 'Assessment' and 'Background (history)' was exactly 5 is 3, which corresponds to ""Introduces themselves and information is complete"".",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the Assessment of the respondent whose score for 'Background (history)' was 2 and score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' was 2?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to find the respondent whose score for 'Background (history)' was 2 and score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' was 2, and then determine their Assessment score.

Looking through the responses:

- Respondent 7: Background (history) = 2, Recommendation (clear recommendation) = 2. Assessment = 2.
- Respondent 8: Background (history) = 3, does not match.
- Respondent 9: Background (history) = 2, Recommendation (clear recommendation) = 3, does not match.
- Respondent 11: Background (history) = 3, does not match.
- Respondent 13: Background (history) = 2, Recommendation (clear recommendation) = 2. Assessment = 2.
- Respondent 20: Background (history) = 2, Recommendation (clear recommendation) = 2. Assessment = 3.
- Respondent 22: Background (history) = 3, does not match.

The respondents that match the criteria are Respondent 7 and Respondent 13, and Respondent 20 does not match because their Recommendation (clear recommendation) score is 2 but Assessment score is 3, not matching the question's criteria for Assessment. However, the question seems to be asking for a single Assessment value. Given the information and the task, it seems there might be an oversight in how the question is framed since multiple respondents could potentially fit the criteria given. However, based on the direct question and focusing on the first matching respondent:

</output>

<task>
What is the Recommendation (global rating scale) of the respondent with the highest Background (history) in the 'III - Sepsis' session?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify all respondents who participated in the 'III - Sepsis' session.
2. Among these respondents, find the one with the highest Background (history) score.
3. Report the Recommendation (global rating scale) of this respondent.

From the provided data:

- Respondent 15 participated in 'III - Sepsis' on 2025-05-04 with a Background (history) score of 2.
- Respondent 4 participated in 'III (Sepsis)' on 2025-05-16 with a Background (history) score of 3.
- Respondent 3 participated in 'III-Sepsis' on 2025-04-04 with a Background (history) score of 3.
- Respondent 7 participated in 'III-Sepsis' on 2025-03-14 with a Background (history) score of 2.

The respondents with the highest Background (history) score in the 'III - Sepsis' session are Respondent 4 and Respondent 3, both with a score of 3.

- Respondent 4 has a Recommendation (global rating scale) of 2.
- Respondent 3 has a Recommendation (global rating scale) of 3.

Since we are looking for the respondent with the highest Background (history) and both Respondent 4 and Respondent 3 have the same high score, we need to consider if there's an instruction on how to proceed in such a case. However, the task does not specify what to do if there's a tie. Given the information and the format required for the answer, we should look for the highest Recommendation (global rating scale) among the tied respondents as it seems to be the next logical step to find a single answer, but since the question asks for ""the respondent with the highest Background (history)"" and does not provide further instructions on ties, we must choose one based on the data given or acknowledge the tie.

Given the direct instruction to follow the format to the letter and provide a single answer, and without further instruction on how to handle a tie, the most logical approach based on the provided data and the requirement for a single answer would be to select the respondent with the higher Recommendation (global rating scale) score in the case of a tie for Background (history), which would be Respondent 3.

Therefore, the Recommendation (global rating scale) of Respondent 3, who has the highest Background (history) score and also the highest Recommendation (global rating scale) in the event of a tie, is 3. According to the schema, a score of 3 corresponds to ""Confident and required little or no questioning"".

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the Situation of the respondent with the highest Recommendation (clear recommendation) in the 'II - Anaphylaxsis' session?
</task>","To answer this question, we first need to identify the respondents who participated in the 'II - Anaphylaxsis' session and then find the one with the highest Recommendation (clear recommendation) score. After identifying this respondent, we will determine their Situation score.

From the provided data:

- Respondent 9 participated in the 'II (Anaphylaxsis)' session on '2025-05-04' with a Recommendation (clear recommendation) score of 3.
- Respondent 5 participated in the 'II - Anaphylaxsis' session on '2025-05-04' with a Recommendation (clear recommendation) score of 2.
- Respondent 23 participated in the 'II-Anaphylaxsis' session on '2025-03-14' with a Recommendation (clear recommendation) score of 3.

Both Respondent 9 and Respondent 23 have the highest Recommendation (clear recommendation) score of 3 in the 'II - Anaphylaxsis' session. 

For Respondent 9, the Situation score is 3.
For Respondent 23, the Situation score is 3.

Since both respondents have the same high score for Recommendation (clear recommendation) and the same Situation score, the answer to the question regarding the Situation of the respondent with the highest Recommendation (clear recommendation) in the 'II - Anaphylaxsis' session is the same for both: 3.

According to the schema, a Situation score of 3 means ""Identifies and prioritizes the main problem(s) unprompted"".

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Recommendation (global rating scale) of the respondent with the highest Recommendation (global rating scale) in the 'II (Anaphylaxsis)' session?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to find the respondent with the highest Recommendation (global rating scale) in the 'II (Anaphylaxsis)' session.

From the 'responses' section, we can see that there are two respondents who participated in the 'II (Anaphylaxsis)' session: Respondent 9 and Respondent 5.

Respondent 9 has a Recommendation (global rating scale) of 2, while Respondent 5 has a Recommendation (global rating scale) of 3.

Since 3 is higher than 2, the respondent with the highest Recommendation (global rating scale) in the 'II (Anaphylaxsis)' session is Respondent 5, with a score of 3.

According to the 'questions' schema, a score of 3 in the Recommendation (global rating scale) corresponds to ""Confident and required little or no questioning"".

Therefore, the final answer is: Confident and required little or no questioning.",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

What is the Recommendation (global rating scale) of the respondent whose total score for 'Background (examination)' and 'Assessment' was exactly 5?
</task>","To find the respondent whose total score for 'Background (examination)' and 'Assessment' was exactly 5, we need to look through the responses and calculate this total for each respondent.

The possible combinations that result in a total of 5 are:
- 'Background (examination)' = 2 and 'Assessment' = 3
- 'Background (examination)' = 3 and 'Assessment' = 2

Let's examine each respondent's data:

### Respondent 18
- **Background (examination):** 2
- **Assessment:** 3
Total = 5

### Respondent 2
- **Background (examination):** 3
- **Assessment:** 3
Total = 6 (does not match)

### Respondent 12
- **Background (examination):** 3
- **Assessment:** 2
Total = 5

### Respondent 19
- **Background (examination):** 3
- **Assessment:** 2
Total = 5

### Respondent 23
- **Background (examination):** 2
- **Assessment:** 3
Total = 5

### Respondent 5
- **Background (examination):** 3
- **Assessment:** 3
Total = 6 (does not match)

### Respondent 14
- **Background (examination):** 2
- **Assessment:** 3
Total = 5

### Respondent 20
- **Background (examination):** -1
- **Assessment:** 3
Total = 2 (does not match)

### Respondent 1
- **Background (examination):** 2
- **Assessment:** 3
Total = 5

The respondents with a total score of 5 for 'Background (examination)' and 'Assessment' are Respondent 18, Respondent 12, Respondent 19, Respondent 23, Respondent 14, and Respondent 1.

Now, let's find their Recommendation (global rating scale):

### Respondent 18
- **Recommendation (global rating scale):** 2

### Respondent 12
- **Recommendation (global rating scale):** 3

### Respondent 19
- **Recommendation (global rating scale):** 3

### Respondent 23
- **Recommendation (global rating scale):** 3

### Respondent 14
- **Recommendation (global rating scale):** 2

### Respondent 1
- **Recommendation (global rating scale):** 2

According to the schema, the Recommendation (global rating scale) is defined as:
- 0 = Not at all confident
- 1 = Confident but required extended questioning
- 2 = Confident but required some further questioning
- 3 = Confident and required little or no questioning

Therefore, the Recommendation (global rating scale) for these respondents are:
- Respondent 18: Confident but required some further questioning
- Respondent 12: Confident and required little or no questioning
- Respondent 19: Confident and required little or no questioning
- Respondent 23: Confident and required little or no questioning
- Respondent 14: Confident but required some further questioning
- Respondent 1: Confident but required some further questioning

Since the task is to find the Recommendation (global rating scale) of the respondent whose total score for 'Background (examination)' and 'Assessment' was exactly 5, and there are multiple respondents with this score, the question's request for a single answer cannot be directly fulfilled based on the provided instructions. However, following the format strictly as requested and given the nature of the question, it seems the task implies finding a match rather than listing all possibilities. Given this, one of the matches is:

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the Recommendation (global rating scale) of the respondent from the 'II-Anaphylaxsis' session whose Recommendation (global rating scale) is higher than the average Recommendation (global rating scale) for all sessions on '2025-03-14'?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average Recommendation (global rating scale) for all sessions on '2025-03-14'. Then, we identify the respondent from the 'II-Anaphylaxsis' session whose Recommendation (global rating scale) is higher than this average.

1. **Identify sessions on '2025-03-14'**:
   - Respondent 23: II-Anaphylaxsis, Recommendation (global rating scale) = 3
   - Respondent 7: III-Sepsis, Recommendation (global rating scale) = 2
   - Respondent 14: IV-Hypoglycemia, Recommendation (global rating scale) = 2
   - Respondent 10: (MI)-VT, Recommendation (global rating scale) = 2

2. **Calculate the average Recommendation (global rating scale) for '2025-03-14'**:
   - Average = (3 + 2 + 2 + 2) / 4 = 9 / 4 = 2.25

3. **Identify the respondent from 'II-Anaphylaxsis' with a Recommendation (global rating scale) higher than the average**:
   - Respondent 23 has a Recommendation (global rating scale) of 3, which is higher than 2.25.

4. **Determine the Recommendation (global rating scale)**:
   - Since Respondent 23's score is 3, and according to the schema, 3 corresponds to ""Confident and required little or no questioning"", this is the Recommendation (global rating scale) we are looking for.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Recommendation (clear recommendation) of the respondent whose total score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and 'Situation' was exactly 4?
</task>","To find the respondent whose total score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and 'Situation' was exactly 4, we need to look through the responses and calculate this total for each respondent.

Given that the scores for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and 'Situation' can range from 0 to 3, a total of exactly 4 could be achieved with scores of (3,1), (1,3), or (2,2).

Let's examine the responses:

### Respondent 12
- **Recommendation (clear recommendation):** 3
- **Situation:** 3
Total: 6 (Does not match)

### Respondent 21
- **Recommendation (clear recommendation):** 3
- **Situation:** 2
Total: 5 (Does not match)

### Respondent 17
- **Recommendation (clear recommendation):** 3
- **Situation:** 3
Total: 6 (Does not match)

### Respondent 13
- **Recommendation (clear recommendation):** 2
- **Situation:** 3
Total: 5 (Does not match)

### Respondent 18
- **Recommendation (clear recommendation):** 2
- **Situation:** 3
Total: 5 (Does not match)

### Respondent 11
- **Recommendation (clear recommendation):** 3
- **Situation:** 3
Total: 6 (Does not match)

### Respondent 1
- **Recommendation (clear recommendation):** 2
- **Situation:** 2
Total: 4 (Matches)

### Respondent 4
- **Recommendation (clear recommendation):** 2
- **Situation:** 3
Total: 5 (Does not match)

### Respondent 15
- **Recommendation (clear recommendation):** 2
- **Situation:** 3
Total: 5 (Does not match)

### Respondent 5
- **Recommendation (clear recommendation):** 2
- **Situation:** 3
Total: 5 (Does not match)

Only Respondent 1 has a total score of exactly 4 for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and 'Situation'. 

The Recommendation (clear recommendation) for Respondent 1 is 2, which according to the schema means ""Clear recommendation after minimal questioning"".

The final answer is: Clear recommendation after minimal questioning",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Recommendation (global rating scale) of the respondent from the 'II - Anaphylaxsis' session whose Background (history) is higher than the average Background (history) for all sessions on '2025-05-04'?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average Background (history) for all sessions on '2025-05-04'. Then, we identify the respondent from the 'II - Anaphylaxsis' session with a Background (history) score higher than this average. Finally, we determine the Recommendation (global rating scale) for this respondent.

1. **Identify sessions on '2025-05-04'**:
   - Respondent 18: **Date:** 2025-05-04, **SessionName:** IV - VT, **Background (history):** 2
   - Respondent 5: **Date:** 2025-05-04, **SessionName:** II - Anaphylaxsis, **Background (history):** 3

2. **Calculate the average Background (history) for these sessions**:
   - Average = (2 + 3) / 2 = 5 / 2 = 2.5

3. **Identify the respondent from 'II - Anaphylaxsis' with Background (history) higher than the average**:
   - Respondent 5 has a **Background (history)** of 3, which is higher than the average of 2.5.

4. **Determine the Recommendation (global rating scale) for this respondent**:
   - Respondent 5's **Recommendation (global rating scale):** 3

According to the schema, a score of 3 for **Recommendation (global rating scale)** corresponds to ""Confident and required little or no questioning"".

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Recommendation (clear recommendation) of the respondent from the 'IV (VT)' session whose Situation is higher than the average Situation for all sessions on '2025-05-02'?
</task>","To answer this question, we first need to calculate the average Situation score for all sessions on '2025-05-02'. Then, we identify the respondent from the 'IV (VT)' session with a Situation score higher than this average and determine their Recommendation (clear recommendation).

1. **Calculate the average Situation score for '2025-05-02' sessions:**

Looking at the data for '2025-05-02':
- Respondent 1: Situation = 2
- Respondent 16: Situation = 3
- Respondent 20: Situation = 3

Average Situation = (2 + 3 + 3) / 3 = 8 / 3 = 2.67

2. **Identify the 'IV (VT)' session respondent with Situation higher than the average:**

The average Situation score is 2.67. We look for respondents with SessionName 'IV (VT)' and Situation > 2.67:
- Respondent 20 is the one with SessionName 'IV (VT)' and Situation = 3, which is higher than 2.67.

3. **Determine the Recommendation (clear recommendation) for this respondent:**

For Respondent 20, Recommendation (clear recommendation) = 2

According to the schema, Recommendation (clear recommendation) is rated as follows: 
- 0 = No recommendation
- 1 = Clear recommendation only after extended questioning
- 2 = Clear recommendation after minimal questioning
- 3 = Clear comprehensive recommendation without questioning

Therefore, the Recommendation (clear recommendation) for Respondent 20 is ""Clear recommendation after minimal questioning"".",True
