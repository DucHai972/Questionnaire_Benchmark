<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Identification of the respondent from the 'III-Sepsis' session on '2025-03-14'?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to find the respondent who participated in the 'III-Sepsis' session on '2025-03-14' and then determine their Identification score.

Looking through the responses, we find two respondents who participated in the 'III-Sepsis' session, but only one of them was on '2025-03-14':

- Respondent id=""7"" participated in the 'III-Sepsis' session on '2025-03-14' and had an Identification score of ""3"".

According to the schema, an Identification score of ""3"" means ""Introduces themselves and information is complete"".

Therefore, the Identification of the respondent from the 'III-Sepsis' session on '2025-03-14' is: Introduces themselves and information is complete.",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the Background (history) of the respondent from the 'I - MI' session on '2025-05-16'?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to find the respondent who attended the 'I - MI' session on '2025-05-16' and then look at their answer for the 'Background (history)' question.

Looking through the responses, we find a respondent with id ""19"" who attended the 'I - MI' session on '2025-05-16'. Their answer for 'Background (history)' is ""3"".

According to the schema, the 'Background (history)' question has the following rubric:
""[Rubric: 0 = History is unstructured or non-relevant, 1 = Relevant history but frequent clarification needed, 2 = Relevant history with few further questions needed, 3 = Comprehensive focused history]"".

So, the Background (history) of the respondent from the 'I - MI' session on '2025-05-16' is ""Comprehensive focused history"".",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Recommendation (global rating scale) of the respondent from the 'MI' session on '2025-04-04'?
</task>","To answer this question, we first need to find the respondent who attended the 'MI' session on '2025-04-04'. Then, we look at their answer for the ""Recommendation (global rating scale)"" question.

From the provided data, the respondent with id ""2"" attended the 'MI' session on '2025-04-04'. Their answer for the ""Recommendation (global rating scale)"" is ""1"".

According to the schema, the ""Recommendation (global rating scale)"" has the following rubric:

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Background (examination) of the respondent from the 'II - Anaphylaxsis' session on '2025-05-04'?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to find the respondent who participated in the 'II - Anaphylaxsis' session on '2025-05-04' and then find their answer to the 'Background (examination)' question.

Looking through the responses, we find two respondents who match the session and date: respondent id ""5"" and respondent id ""9"".

Respondent id ""5"" has the following answer for 'Background (examination)': 3. 
Respondent id ""9"" has the following answer for 'Background (examination)': 2.

According to the schema, the 'Background (examination)' question has the following rubric: 
""[Rubric: 0 = Observations are omitted or irrelevant, 1 = Observations reported but frequent clarification needed, 2 = Observations reported with few further questions needed, 3 = Comprehensive focused examination/observations]"".

So, the Background (examination) for respondent id ""5"" is: Comprehensive focused examination/observations
And the Background (examination) for respondent id ""9"" is: Observations reported with few further questions needed.

Since the question is asking for a single answer and there are two possible respondents, it seems there might be an oversight in the question as it does not specify which respondent to consider if there are multiple. However, following the format strictly as requested and considering the first matching respondent (id ""5"") for a direct and concise answer:

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Background (history) of the respondent from the '(MI)-VT' session on '2025-03-14'?
</task>","To answer this question, we first need to identify the respondent who participated in the '(MI)-VT' session on '2025-03-14'. Then, we will look at their answer for the 'Background (history)' question.

Looking through the responses, we find the respondent with id ""10"" who participated in the '(MI)-VT' session on '2025-03-14'. Their answer for 'Background (history)' is ""2"".

According to the schema, the 'Background (history)' question has the following rubric:
""[Rubric: 0 = History is unstructured or non-relevant, 1 = Relevant history but frequent clarification needed, 2 = Relevant history with few further questions needed, 3 = Comprehensive focused history]"".

So, the Background (history) of the respondent from the '(MI)-VT' session on '2025-03-14' is ""Relevant history with few further questions needed"".",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Situation of the respondent from the 'IV (VT)' session on '2025-05-02'?
</task>","To answer this question, we first need to find the respondent who participated in the 'IV (VT)' session on '2025-05-02'. Then, we will look at their answer to the ""Situation"" question.

Looking through the responses:

- Respondent 18 participated in 'IV - VT' on '2025-05-04', not '2025-05-02'.
- Respondent 17 participated in 'V (Hypoglycemia)' on '2025-05-04', not 'IV (VT)' on '2025-05-02'.
- Respondent 1 participated in 'V (Hypoglycemia)' on '2025-05-02', not 'IV (VT)'.
- Respondent 20 participated in 'IV (VT)' on '2025-05-02'. This is the correct respondent.
- Respondent 11 participated in 'IV (AF)' on '2025-04-04', not 'IV (VT)' on '2025-05-02'.
- Respondent 16 participated in 'I - MI' on '2025-05-02', not 'IV (VT)'.
- Respondent 21 participated in 'I (Myocardial infarction)' on '2025-05-16', not 'IV (VT)' on '2025-05-02'.

Respondent 20's answer to the ""Situation"" question is ""3"". According to the schema, the ""Situation"" question is scored as follows:
""[Rubric: 0 = Unable to identify the main problem(s), 1 = Identifies the main problem(s) after extended prompting, 2 = Identifies the main problem(s) with fewer prompts needed, 3 = Identifies and prioritizes the main problem(s) unprompted]"".

Therefore, the Situation of the respondent from the 'IV (VT)' session on '2025-05-02' is ""Identifies and prioritizes the main problem(s) unprompted"".",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Recommendation (global rating scale) of the respondent from the 'IV (VT)' session on '2025-05-02'?
</task>","To answer this question, we first need to identify the respondent who participated in the 'IV (VT)' session on '2025-05-02'. Then, we will look up their answer to the ""Recommendation (global rating scale)"" question.

From the provided data, the respondent with id ""20"" is the one who participated in the 'IV (VT)' session on '2025-05-02'. 

The ""Recommendation (global rating scale)"" question has the following rubric:
""[Rubric: 0 = Not at all confident, 1 = Confident but required extended questioning, 2 = Confident but required some further questioning, 3 = Confident and required little or no questioning]"".

Respondent ""20"" answered ""3"" to this question. According to the rubric, ""3"" corresponds to ""Confident and required little or no questioning"".

The final answer is: Confident and required little or no questioning",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>
</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Recommendation (clear recommendation) of respondent '5'?
</task>","Clear comprehensive recommendation without questioning is not the correct answer because respondent '5' has a score of 2 for Recommendation (clear recommendation). 

According to the schema, a score of 2 corresponds to ""Clear recommendation after minimal questioning"". 

The final answer is: Clear recommendation after minimal questioning",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Background (examination) of the respondent from the 'IV (AF)' session on '2025-04-04'?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to find the respondent who attended the 'IV (AF)' session on '2025-04-04' and then look at their answer for the 'Background (examination)' question.

Looking through the responses, we find a respondent with id ""11"" who attended the 'IV (AF)' session on '2025-04-04'. Their answer for 'Background (examination)' is ""3"".

According to the schema, the 'Background (examination)' question has the following rubric:
""[Rubric: 0 = Observations are omitted or irrelevant, 1 = Observations reported but frequent clarification needed, 2 = Observations reported with few further questions needed, 3 = Comprehensive focused examination/observations]"".

So, the Background (examination) of the respondent from the 'IV (AF)' session on '2025-04-04' is ""Comprehensive focused examination/observations"".",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Assessment of the respondent with the highest Recommendation (global rating scale) in the 'IV-Hypoglycemia' session?
</task>","To answer this question, we first need to identify the respondent with the highest Recommendation (global rating scale) in the 'IV-Hypoglycemia' session. 

Looking through the responses, we find that the respondent with id ""14"" is the one who participated in the 'IV-Hypoglycemia' session. 

The Recommendation (global rating scale) for respondent id ""14"" is 2.

Now, we need to find the Assessment of this respondent. 

The Assessment of respondent id ""14"" is 3.

According to the schema, the Assessment is described as: 
""Makes logical assessment (correlates problem, history, exam, context). [Rubric: 0 = No logical assessment, 1 = Assessment only after extended questioning, 2 = Assessment after minimal questioning, 3 = Comprehensive logical assessment without questioning]"".

So, the Assessment of the respondent with the highest Recommendation (global rating scale) in the 'IV-Hypoglycemia' session is ""Comprehensive logical assessment without questioning"".",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Background (history) of the respondent whose total score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and 'Assessment' was exactly 4?
</task>","To find the respondent whose total score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and 'Assessment' was exactly 4, we need to look at the scores for these two questions for each respondent and then find the one that matches this criterion.

The scores for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and 'Assessment' for each respondent are as follows:

- Respondent 8: Recommendation = 2, Assessment = 2, Total = 4
- Respondent 6: Recommendation = 2, Assessment = 2, Total = 4
- Respondent 14: Recommendation = 1, Assessment = 3, Total = 4
- Respondent 16: Recommendation = 2, Assessment = 3, Total = 5
- Respondent 20: Recommendation = 2, Assessment = 3, Total = 5
- Respondent 7: Recommendation = 2, Assessment = 2, Total = 4

The respondents with a total score of exactly 4 for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and 'Assessment' are respondents 8, 6, 14, and 7.

Now, we need to find the Background (history) for these respondents:

- Respondent 8: Background (history) = 3
- Respondent 6: Background (history) = 3
- Respondent 14: Background (history) = 2
- Respondent 7: Background (history) = 2

According to the schema, the scores for Background (history) are:
- 0 = History is unstructured or non-relevant
- 1 = Relevant history but frequent clarification needed
- 2 = Relevant history with few further questions needed
- 3 = Comprehensive focused history

Therefore, the Background (history) for the respondents with a total score of exactly 4 is:
- For respondents 8 and 6: Comprehensive focused history
- For respondents 14 and 7: Relevant history with few further questions needed

Since the question asks for the Background (history) of the respondent whose total score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and 'Assessment' was exactly 4, and there are multiple respondents with this score, the answer should reflect the possible backgrounds. However, following the format strictly as requested, I will provide the answer based on the first matching respondent's background, which might not fully capture the complexity of the question's request for multiple possible answers.

The final answer is: Comprehensive focused history",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Identification of the respondent whose total score for 'Assessment' and 'Background (history)' was exactly 5?
</task>","To find the Identification of the respondent whose total score for 'Assessment' and 'Background (history)' was exactly 5, we need to examine each respondent's answers for these two questions and calculate their total.

The possible scores for 'Assessment' and 'Background (history)' range from 0 to 3, based on the provided schema. We are looking for a combination that sums up to 5. The possible combinations that result in a total score of 5 are (2,3) and (3,2), given the scoring system.

Let's go through the respondents and find the ones with a total score of 5 for 'Assessment' and 'Background (history)':

1. Respondent 17: Assessment = 3, Background (history) = 3, Total = 6 (does not match)
2. Respondent 6: Assessment = 2, Background (history) = 3, Total = 5 (matches)
3. Respondent 2: Assessment = 3, Background (history) = 2, Total = 5 (matches)
4. Respondent 23: Assessment = 3, Background (history) = 2, Total = 5 (matches)
5. Respondent 3: Assessment = 3, Background (history) = 3, Total = 6 (does not match)
6. Respondent 22: Assessment = 2, Background (history) = 3, Total = 5 (matches)
7. Respondent 19: Assessment = 2, Background (history) = 3, Total = 5 (matches)
8. Respondent 20: Assessment = 3, Background (history) = 2, Total = 5 (matches)
9. Respondent 11: Assessment = 3, Background (history) = 3, Total = 6 (does not match)
10. Respondent 14: Assessment = 3, Background (history) = 2, Total = 5 (matches)
11. Respondent 4: Assessment = 2, Background (history) = 3, Total = 5 (matches)
12. Respondent 7: Assessment = 2, Background (history) = 2, Total = 4 (does not match)

The respondents with a total score of 5 are: 6, 2, 23, 22, 19, 20, 14, and 4.

Now, we need to find the Identification score for these respondents:

- Respondent 6: Identification = 3
- Respondent 2: Identification = 3
- Respondent 23: Identification = 3
- Respondent 22: Identification = 3
- Respondent 19: Identification = 3
- Respondent 20: Identification = 3
- Respondent 14: Identification = 3
- Respondent 4: Identification = 3

All the respondents with a total score of 5 for 'Assessment' and 'Background (history)' have an Identification score of 3, which means they ""Introduce themselves and information is complete"". 

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Assessment of the respondent whose score for 'Background (history)' was 2 and score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' was 2?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to find the respondent whose score for 'Background (history)' was 2 and score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' was 2, and then determine their Assessment score.

After analyzing the 'responses' section, we found several respondents who match this criteria:

- Respondent 7: 
  - 'Background (history)' score: 2
  - 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' score: 2
  - Assessment score: 2

- Respondent 8: 
  - 'Background (history)' score: 3 (does not match)
  
- Respondent 13: 
  - 'Background (history)' score: 2
  - 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' score: 2
  - Assessment score: 2

- Respondent 10: 
  - 'Background (history)' score: 2
  - 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' score: 2
  - Assessment score: 2

- Respondent 20: 
  - 'Background (history)' score: 2
  - 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' score: 2
  - Assessment score: 3 (does not match the assessment score we are looking for)

- Respondent 6: 
  - 'Background (history)' score: 3 (does not match)

The respondents with a 'Background (history)' score of 2 and a 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' score of 2 are respondents 7, 13, and 10. 

All of these respondents have an Assessment score of 2. 

According to the 'questions' schema, an Assessment score of 2 corresponds to ""Assessment after minimal questioning"".

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Recommendation (global rating scale) of the respondent with the highest Background (history) in the 'III - Sepsis' session?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify all respondents who participated in the 'III - Sepsis' session.
2. Among these respondents, find the one with the highest Background (history) score.
3. Report the Recommendation (global rating scale) of this respondent.

From the provided data, the respondents who participated in the 'III - Sepsis' session are:

- Respondent id=""15"" with Background (history) score = 2
- Respondent id=""4"" with Background (history) score = 3
- Respondent id=""3"" with Background (history) score = 3
- Respondent id=""7"" with Background (history) score = 2

The respondents with the highest Background (history) score in the 'III - Sepsis' session are respondent id=""4"" and respondent id=""3"", both with a score of 3.

Now, we need to find the Recommendation (global rating scale) for these respondents:

- Respondent id=""4"" has a Recommendation (global rating scale) score = 2
- Respondent id=""3"" has a Recommendation (global rating scale) score = 3

Since the question asks for the Recommendation (global rating scale) of the respondent with the highest Background (history) in the 'III - Sepsis' session, and both respondents id=""4"" and id=""3"" have the same highest score for Background (history), we should look for the one with the highest Recommendation (global rating scale) if the instruction was to pick one. However, the task does not specify what to do in the case of a tie, so based on the provided instructions, we can report the Recommendation (global rating scale) for both, but since the format asks for a single final answer and given the constraints, we'll follow the instruction to the letter as requested and provide the answer for the first mentioned respondent with the highest score in case of a tie, which is not explicitly defined in the task but implied by the need for a single answer.

Given the rubric for Recommendation (global rating scale), the score of 2 corresponds to ""Confident but required some further questioning"" and the score of 3 corresponds to ""Confident and required little or no questioning"". Since respondent id=""3"" has the higher Recommendation (global rating scale) score, the answer should reflect this, but to adhere strictly to the format and the implication of providing a single answer in the context of the question, we recognize the primary goal is to identify the best match based on the criteria given.

The final answer is: Confident and required little or no questioning",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Situation of the respondent whose score for 'Situation' was 3 and score for 'Background (examination)' was 3?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to find the respondent whose score for 'Situation' was 3 and score for 'Background (examination)' was 3, and then determine their Situation.

According to the 'questions' schema, the 'Situation' question is ""Identifies the main problem(s). [Rubric: 0 = Unable to identify the main problem(s), 1 = Identifies the main problem(s) after extended prompting, 2 = Identifies the main problem(s) with fewer prompts needed, 3 = Identifies and prioritizes the main problem(s) unprompted]"".

Looking at the 'responses' section, we can see that there are several respondents who scored 3 for 'Situation' and 3 for 'Background (examination)'. 

For example, respondent id ""12"" has a score of 3 for 'Situation' and 3 for 'Background (examination)'. 
Another example is respondent id ""8"" who also has a score of 3 for 'Situation' but only 2 for 'Background (examination)', so this respondent does not meet the criteria.
Respondent id ""16"" has a score of 3 for 'Situation' and 3 for 'Background (examination)'.

Since the score for 'Situation' is 3, according to the schema, this corresponds to ""Identifies and prioritizes the main problem(s) unprompted"".

The final answer is: Identifies and prioritizes the main problem(s) unprompted",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Identification of the respondent whose score for 'Background (history)' was 2 and score for 'Assessment' was 3?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to find the respondent whose score for 'Background (history)' was 2 and score for 'Assessment' was 3.

Looking at the 'responses' section, we can see that there are two respondents who meet this criteria: respondent 18 and respondent 1, and respondent 2.

Respondent 18's score for 'Background (history)' is 2 and score for 'Assessment' is 3. 
Respondent 1's score for 'Background (history)' is 2 and score for 'Assessment' is 3.
Respondent 2's score for 'Background (history)' is 2 and score for 'Assessment' is 3.

The 'Identification' score for respondent 18 is 3, which according to the schema means ""Introduces themselves and information is complete"".
The 'Identification' score for respondent 1 is -1, which is not defined in the schema.
The 'Identification' score for respondent 2 is 3, which according to the schema means ""Introduces themselves and information is complete"".

Since the question asks for the Identification of the respondent, we will output the text that corresponds to the score. 

The final answer is: Introduces themselves and information is complete.",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Situation of the respondent with the highest Recommendation (clear recommendation) in the 'II - Anaphylaxsis' session?
</task>","To answer this question, we first need to identify the respondents who participated in the 'II - Anaphylaxsis' session, and then find the one with the highest Recommendation (clear recommendation) score. Finally, we will determine the Situation of that respondent.

From the provided data, the respondents who participated in the 'II - Anaphylaxsis' session are:

- Respondent 9
- Respondent 5
- Respondent 23

Their Recommendation (clear recommendation) scores are:
- Respondent 9: 3
- Respondent 5: 2
- Respondent 23: 3

The respondents with the highest Recommendation (clear recommendation) score are Respondent 9 and Respondent 23, both with a score of 3.

Now, we need to find the Situation of these respondents:
- Respondent 9: Situation score is 3
- Respondent 23: Situation score is 3

According to the schema, a Situation score of 3 means ""Identifies and prioritizes the main problem(s) unprompted"".

Therefore, the Situation of the respondents with the highest Recommendation (clear recommendation) in the 'II - Anaphylaxsis' session is ""Identifies and prioritizes the main problem(s) unprompted"".",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Recommendation (global rating scale) of the respondent with the highest Recommendation (global rating scale) in the 'II (Anaphylaxsis)' session?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to find the respondent with the highest Recommendation (global rating scale) in the 'II (Anaphylaxsis)' session.

From the 'responses' section, we can see that there are two respondents who participated in the 'II (Anaphylaxsis)' session: respondent 9 and respondent 5. 

Respondent 9 has a Recommendation (global rating scale) of 2.
Respondent 5 has a Recommendation (global rating scale) of 3.

Since 3 is higher than 2, respondent 5 has the highest Recommendation (global rating scale) in the 'II (Anaphylaxsis)' session.

According to the 'questions' schema, a Recommendation (global rating scale) of 3 corresponds to ""Confident and required little or no questioning"".

The final answer is: Confident and required little or no questioning",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Recommendation (global rating scale) of the respondent whose total score for 'Background (examination)' and 'Assessment' was exactly 5?
</task>","To find the respondent whose total score for 'Background (examination)' and 'Assessment' was exactly 5, we need to look at the scores for these two questions for each respondent and then find the one that matches this criterion.

The possible scores for 'Background (examination)' and 'Assessment' range from 0 to 3, based on the provided schema. A total score of exactly 5 could be achieved with a combination of scores such as (2,3) or (3,2) for 'Background (examination)' and 'Assessment', respectively.

Let's examine the responses:

1. Respondent 18: 'Background (examination)' = 2, 'Assessment' = 3. Total = 5.
2. Respondent 2: 'Background (examination)' = 3, 'Assessment' = 3. Total = 6.
3. Respondent 12: 'Background (examination)' = 3, 'Assessment' = 2. Total = 5.
4. Respondent 19: 'Background (examination)' = 3, 'Assessment' = 2. Total = 5.
5. Respondent 23: 'Background (examination)' = 2, 'Assessment' = 3. Total = 5.
6. Respondent 5: 'Background (examination)' = 3, 'Assessment' = 3. Total = 6.
7. Respondent 14: 'Background (examination)' = 2, 'Assessment' = 3. Total = 5.
8. Respondent 20: 'Background (examination)' = -1, 'Assessment' = 3. Total = 2.
9. Respondent 1: 'Background (examination)' = 2, 'Assessment' = 3. Total = 5.

The respondents with a total score of exactly 5 for 'Background (examination)' and 'Assessment' are respondents 18, 12, 19, 23, 14, and 1.

Now, we need to find the Recommendation (global rating scale) for these respondents:

- Respondent 18: Recommendation (global rating scale) = 2
- Respondent 12: Recommendation (global rating scale) = 3
- Respondent 19: Recommendation (global rating scale) = 3
- Respondent 23: Recommendation (global rating scale) = 3
- Respondent 14: Recommendation (global rating scale) = 2
- Respondent 1: Recommendation (global rating scale) = 2

According to the schema, the Recommendation (global rating scale) is defined as:
- 0 = Not at all confident
- 1 = Confident but required extended questioning
- 2 = Confident but required some further questioning
- 3 = Confident and required little or no questioning

Therefore, the Recommendation (global rating scale) values in text form for the respondents with a total score of 5 are:
- Respondent 18: Confident but required some further questioning
- Respondent 12: Confident and required little or no questioning
- Respondent 19: Confident and required little or no questioning
- Respondent 23: Confident and required little or no questioning
- Respondent 14: Confident but required some further questioning
- Respondent 1: Confident but required some further questioning

Since the task asks for the Recommendation (global rating scale) of the respondent whose total score for 'Background (examination)' and 'Assessment' was exactly 5, and there are multiple respondents with this score, the question's request is ambiguous because it implies a singular answer. However, following the format strictly as requested and considering the need to provide a concise answer, it seems the task requires an interpretation that might not fully align with the provided data structure, as there are multiple valid answers based on the given criteria.

Given the constraints of the format and the ambiguity in the question, a direct and concise answer that fits the format requirement (which seems to expect a single value) cannot be accurately provided without further clarification on how to handle multiple respondents meeting the criteria. However, to adhere to the format as closely as possible and recognizing the primary goal is to provide an answer based on the data:

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Recommendation (global rating scale) of the respondent from the 'II-Anaphylaxsis' session whose Recommendation (global rating scale) is higher than the average Recommendation (global rating scale) for all sessions on '2025-03-14'?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average Recommendation (global rating scale) for all sessions on '2025-03-14'. Then, we identify the respondent from the 'II-Anaphylaxsis' session whose Recommendation (global rating scale) is higher than this average.

1. **Calculate the average Recommendation (global rating scale) for '2025-03-14' sessions:**

From the data, the respondents with sessions on '2025-03-14' are:
- Respondent id=""23"" with SessionName=""II-Anaphylaxsis"" and Recommendation (global rating scale)=3
- Respondent id=""7"" with SessionName=""III-Sepsis"" and Recommendation (global rating scale)=2
- Respondent id=""14"" with SessionName=""IV-Hypoglycemia"" and Recommendation (global rating scale)=2
- Respondent id=""10"" with SessionName=""(MI)-VT"" and Recommendation (global rating scale)=2

Average = (3 + 2 + 2 + 2) / 4 = 9 / 4 = 2.25

2. **Identify the respondent from 'II-Anaphylaxsis' with a higher Recommendation (global rating scale) than the average:**

The only respondent with SessionName=""II-Anaphylaxsis"" on '2025-03-14' is respondent id=""23"" with Recommendation (global rating scale)=3, which is higher than the average of 2.25.

However, the task asks for the Recommendation (global rating scale) of such a respondent. Given the provided data and the specific session name 'II-Anaphylaxsis' on the date '2025-03-14', the relevant respondent's Recommendation (global rating scale) is 3.

According to the schema, the Recommendation (global rating scale) is defined as:
- 0 = Not at all confident
- 1 = Confident but required extended questioning
- 2 = Confident but required some further questioning
- 3 = Confident and required little or no questioning

Thus, the Recommendation (global rating scale) of the respondent from the 'II-Anaphylaxsis' session whose Recommendation (global rating scale) is higher than the average for all sessions on '2025-03-14' is ""Confident and required little or no questioning"".",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Background (examination) of the respondent whose score for 'Background (examination)' was 1 and score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' was 3?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to find the respondent whose score for 'Background (examination)' was 1 and score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' was 3, and then provide their answer for 'Background (examination)'.


After analyzing the data, we found that the respondent id ""21"" has a score of 1 for 'Background (examination)' and a score of 3 for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)'.


The 'Background (examination)' question has the following rubric: 
""[Rubric: 0 = Observations are omitted or irrelevant, 1 = Observations reported but frequent clarification needed, 2 = Observations reported with few further questions needed, 3 = Comprehensive focused examination/observations]""


Since the respondent id ""21"" has a score of 1, their 'Background (examination)' is: ""Observations reported but frequent clarification needed"". 


The final answer is: Observations reported but frequent clarification needed.",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Recommendation (global rating scale) of the respondent with the highest Identification in the 'I-VF' session?
</task>","To answer this question, we first need to identify the respondent with the highest Identification score in the 'I-VF' session, and then find their Recommendation (global rating scale).

From the provided data, we can see that there is only one respondent in the 'I-VF' session, which is respondent id=""13"". 

The Identification score for respondent id=""13"" is 3, which is the highest possible score.

Now, we need to find the Recommendation (global rating scale) for respondent id=""13"". 

According to the data, the Recommendation (global rating scale) for respondent id=""13"" is 2.

Referring to the 'questions' schema, the Recommendation (global rating scale) with a score of 2 corresponds to ""Confident but required some further questioning"".

Therefore, the Recommendation (global rating scale) of the respondent with the highest Identification in the 'I-VF' session is ""Confident but required some further questioning"".",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Background (history) of the respondent whose score for 'Background (history)' was 2 and score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' was 2?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to find the respondent whose score for 'Background (history)' was 2 and score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' was 2, and then provide their answer to the 'Background (history)' question. However, since 'Background (history)' is a rubric-scored question, we will provide the score as it directly answers the query about the background history score, but we must note that the actual ""background history"" in terms of text or description is not directly provided in the responses. The score of 2 corresponds to ""Relevant history with few further questions needed"" according to the schema.


Respondents with a score of 2 for 'Background (history)' and a score of 2 for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' are:


- Respondent id=""10""
- Respondent id=""8""
- Respondent id=""7""
- Respondent id=""13""
- Respondent id=""14""


However, the question seems to ask for a singular respondent's background (history) score, which is already given as 2. The description for this score, as per the schema, is ""Relevant history with few further questions needed"". Since the question does not specify which respondent to choose if there are multiple, and given the instruction to provide the human-readable value, the answer based on the provided schema for a score of 2 in 'Background (history)' would be:


Relevant history with few further questions needed",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Recommendation (clear recommendation) of the respondent whose total score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and 'Situation' was exactly 4?
</task>","To find the respondent whose total score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and 'Situation' was exactly 4, we need to look through the responses and calculate this total for each respondent.

The possible scores for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and 'Situation' are:
- 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)': 0, 1, 2, 3
- 'Situation': 0, 1, 2, 3

We are looking for a combination that sums up to 4. Possible combinations are:
- 0 + 4 (not possible since the maximum score for 'Situation' is 3)
- 1 + 3
- 2 + 2
- 3 + 1
- 4 + 0 (not possible since the minimum score for 'Situation' is 0, but it can be 0 in theory, yet 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' does not have a score of 4)

Let's examine the responses:

1. Respondent 12: 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' = 3, 'Situation' = 3. Total = 6.
2. Respondent 21: 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' = 3, 'Situation' = 2. Total = 5.
3. Respondent 17: 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' = 3, 'Situation' = 3. Total = 6.
4. Respondent 13: 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' = 2, 'Situation' = 3. Total = 5.
5. Respondent 18: 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' = 2, 'Situation' = 3. Total = 5.
6. Respondent 11: 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' = 3, 'Situation' = 3. Total = 6.
7. Respondent 1: 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' = 2, 'Situation' = 2. Total = 4.
8. Respondent 4: 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' = 2, 'Situation' = 3. Total = 5.
9. Respondent 15: 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' = 2, 'Situation' = 3. Total = 5.
10. Respondent 5: 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' = 2, 'Situation' = 3. Total = 5.

Respondent 1 has a total score of 4 for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and 'Situation'. The score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' is 2.

According to the schema, the score of 2 for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' corresponds to ""Clear recommendation after minimal questioning"".

The final answer is: Clear recommendation after minimal questioning.",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Situation of the respondent whose score for 'Situation' was 3 and score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' was 3?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to find the respondent whose score for 'Situation' was 3 and score for 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' was 3, and then determine their Situation.

From the 'responses' section, we can see that there are several respondents who meet this criteria:

- Respondent 12: Situation = 3, Recommendation (clear recommendation) = 3
- Respondent 11: Situation = 3, Recommendation (clear recommendation) = 3
- Respondent 3: Situation = 2, Recommendation (clear recommendation) = 3 (does not meet the criteria)
- Respondent 20: Situation = 3, Recommendation (clear recommendation) = 2 (does not meet the criteria)
- Respondent 4: Situation = 3, Recommendation (clear recommendation) = 2 (does not meet the criteria)
- Respondent 10: Situation = 2, Recommendation (clear recommendation) = 2 (does not meet the criteria)
- Respondent 17: Situation = 3, Recommendation (clear recommendation) = 3
- Respondent 19: Situation = 3, Recommendation (clear recommendation) = 3

The respondents who meet the criteria are respondents 12, 11, 17, and 19.

According to the 'questions' schema, a score of 3 for 'Situation' corresponds to ""Identifies and prioritizes the main problem(s) unprompted"".

Therefore, the Situation of the respondents who meet the criteria is: Identifies and prioritizes the main problem(s) unprompted.",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Recommendation (global rating scale) of the respondent from the 'II - Anaphylaxsis' session whose Background (history) is higher than the average Background (history) for all sessions on '2025-05-04'?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average Background (history) score for all sessions on '2025-05-04'. Then, we identify the respondent from the 'II - Anaphylaxsis' session with a Background (history) score higher than this average. Finally, we determine the Recommendation (global rating scale) for this respondent.

1. **Calculate the average Background (history) score for all sessions on '2025-05-04':**

From the data, the respondents with sessions on '2025-05-04' are:
- Respondent id=""18"" with Background (history) = 2
- Respondent id=""5"" with Background (history) = 3

Average Background (history) = (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5

2. **Identify the respondent from the 'II - Anaphylaxsis' session with a Background (history) score higher than the average:**

The respondent with a session named 'II - Anaphylaxsis' on '2025-05-04' and a Background (history) score higher than 2.5 is:
- Respondent id=""5"" with Background (history) = 3

3. **Determine the Recommendation (global rating scale) for this respondent:**

For respondent id=""5"", the Recommendation (global rating scale) = 3

According to the schema, a score of 3 for Recommendation (global rating scale) corresponds to ""Confident and required little or no questioning"".

The final answer is: Confident and required little or no questioning",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
What is the Recommendation (clear recommendation) of the respondent from the 'IV (VT)' session whose Situation is higher than the average Situation for all sessions on '2025-05-02'?
</task>","To answer this question, we first need to calculate the average Situation score for all sessions on '2025-05-02'. Then, we identify the respondent from the 'IV (VT)' session with a Situation score higher than this average and determine their Recommendation (clear recommendation).

1. **Calculate the average Situation score for '2025-05-02' sessions:**

Looking at the data for '2025-05-02':
- Respondent 1: Situation = 2
- Respondent 16: Situation = 3
- Respondent 20: Situation = 3

Average Situation = (2 + 3 + 3) / 3 = 8 / 3 = 2.67

2. **Identify the 'IV (VT)' session respondent with Situation higher than the average:**

The average Situation score is 2.67. We look for respondents with SessionName 'IV (VT)' and Situation > 2.67:
- Respondent 20 has SessionName 'IV (VT)' and Situation = 3, which is higher than 2.67.

3. **Determine the Recommendation (clear recommendation) for this respondent:**

For Respondent 20, Recommendation (clear recommendation) = 2

According to the schema, Recommendation (clear recommendation) is scored as follows: 
""[Rubric: 0 = No recommendation, 1 = Clear recommendation only after extended questioning, 2 = Clear recommendation after minimal questioning, 3 = Clear comprehensive recommendation without questioning]""

Thus, a score of 2 corresponds to ""Clear recommendation after minimal questioning"". 

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$",True
