</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondents have a total score for 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' greater than 5?
</task>","To solve this task, we need to calculate the total score for 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' for each respondent and then identify those with a total score greater than 5.

Based on the provided data:

- Respondent 21: Recommendation (global rating scale) = 3, Recommendation (clear recommendation) = 3, Total = 6
- Respondent 22: Recommendation (global rating scale) = 3, Recommendation (clear recommendation) = 2, Total = 5
- Respondent 2: Recommendation (global rating scale) = 1, Recommendation (clear recommendation) = 2, Total = 3
- Respondent 5: Recommendation (global rating scale) = 3, Recommendation (clear recommendation) = 2, Total = 5
- Respondent 20: Recommendation (global rating scale) = 3, Recommendation (clear recommendation) = 2, Total = 5
- Respondent 10: Recommendation (global rating scale) = 2, Recommendation (clear recommendation) = 2, Total = 4
- Respondent 3: Recommendation (global rating scale) = 3, Recommendation (clear recommendation) = 3, Total = 6
- Respondent 8: Recommendation (global rating scale) = 3, Recommendation (clear recommendation) = 2, Total = 5
- Respondent 23: Recommendation (global rating scale) = 3, Recommendation (clear recommendation) = 3, Total = 6
- Respondent 9: Recommendation (global rating scale) = 2, Recommendation (clear recommendation) = 3, Total = 5
- Respondent 13: Recommendation (global rating scale) = 2, Recommendation (clear recommendation) = 2, Total = 4
- Respondent 7: Recommendation (global rating scale) = 2, Recommendation (clear recommendation) = 2, Total = 4

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondents have a total score for 'Background (history)' and 'Background (examination)' greater than 4?
</task>","To solve this task, we need to calculate the total score for 'Background (history)' and 'Background (examination)' for each respondent and then identify those with a total score greater than 4.

Based on the provided data:

- Respondent 23: Background (history) = 2, Background (examination) = 2, Total = 4
- Respondent 10: Background (history) = 2, Background (examination) = 2, Total = 4
- Respondent 15: Background (history) = 2, Background (examination) = 3, Total = 5
- Respondent 3: Background (history) = 3, Background (examination) = 3, Total = 6

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' is higher than the average 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' for all sessions on the same date.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' for each date, and then find the respondents whose 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' is higher than this average for their respective session dates.

1. Calculate the average 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' for each date:
   - For '2025-04-04', the average is (3 + 3) / 2 = 3.
   - For '2025-05-02', the average is (2 + 2 + 2) / 3 = 2.
   - For '2025-05-04', the average is (3 + 3) / 2 = 3.
   - For '2025-05-16', the average is (2 + 2) / 2 = 2.
   - For '2025-03-14', the average is (2 + 2) / 2 = 2.

2. Identify respondents whose 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' is higher than the average for their session date:
   - For '2025-04-04', both Respondent 11 and Respondent 3 have a score of 3, which is equal to the average, so none are higher.
   - For '2025-05-02', none have a score higher than 2.
   - For '2025-05-04', both Respondent 9 and Respondent 17 have a score of 3, which is equal to the average, so none are higher.
   - For '2025-05-16', none have a score higher than 2.
   - For '2025-03-14', none have a score higher than 2.

Given the calculations, there are no respondents whose 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' is higher than the average for all sessions on the same date because all respondents' scores are either equal to or less than the average for their respective dates. 

The final answer is: $\boxed{None}$",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'Identification' is higher than the average 'Identification' for all sessions on the same date.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Identification' score for each date, and then find the respondents whose 'Identification' score is higher than this average for their respective dates.

1. Calculate the average 'Identification' score for each date:
   - For '2025-05-02', there is only Respondent 16 with an 'Identification' score of 3. The average is 3.
   - For '2025-05-04', the 'Identification' scores are 3 (Respondent 17), 3 (Respondent 15), and 3 (Respondent 9). The average is (3+3+3)/3 = 3.
   - For '2025-05-16', there is only Respondent 21 with an 'Identification' score of 3. The average is 3.
   - For '2025-04-04', the 'Identification' scores are 3 (Respondent 6) and 3 (Respondent 2). The average is (3+3)/2 = 3.
   - For '2025-03-14', the 'Identification' scores are 3 (Respondent 14) and 3 (Respondent 23). The average is (3+3)/2 = 3.

2. Identify respondents whose 'Identification' score is higher than the average for their date:
   - Since all averages are 3 and all 'Identification' scores considered are 3, there are no respondents with a score higher than the average for their respective dates.

Therefore, the list of respondents whose 'Identification' is higher than the average 'Identification' for all sessions on the same date is empty.",False

<task>
Which respondents participated in a session where the average 'Assessment' for that session name is greater than 2.0?
</task>","To solve this, we first need to calculate the average 'Assessment' score for each 'SessionName'. Then, we identify which respondents participated in sessions where this average is greater than 2.0.

1. **Calculate Average 'Assessment' per SessionName:**

- **II (Anaphylaxis)**: Respondents 12 and 5 have scores of 2 and 3, respectively. Average = (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5
- **IV-Hypoglycemia**: Respondent 14 has a score of 3. Average = 3
- **IV (AF)**: Respondent 11 has a score of 3. Average = 3
- **I (Myocardial infarction)**: Respondent 21 has a score of 2. Average = 2
- **III (Sepsis)**: Respondents 4 and 8 have scores of 2. Average = 2
- **II (Anaphylactic Shock)**: Respondent 6 has a score of 2. Average = 2
- **IV (VT)**: Respondents 20 and 22 have scores of 3 and 2, respectively. Average = (3 + 2) / 2 = 2.5
- **II-Anaphylaxsis**: Respondent 23 has a score of 3. Average = 3

2. **Identify Sessions with Average 'Assessment' > 2.0:**

- **II (Anaphylaxis)**: 2.5
- **IV-Hypoglycemia**: 3
- **IV (AF)**: 3
- **IV (VT)**: 2.5
- **II-Anaphylaxsis**: 3

3. **List Respondents in These Sessions:**

- **II (Anaphylaxis)**: 12, 5
- **IV-Hypoglycemia**: 14
- **IV (AF)**: 11
- **IV (VT)**: 20, 22
- **II-Anaphylaxsis**: 23

Therefore, the respondents who participated in sessions where the average 'Assessment' for that session name is greater than 2.0 are: 12, 5, 14, 11, 20, 22, 23.",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents who scored perfectly on 'Identification' and 'Background (history)' and whose 'Background (examination)' is below the average for all sessions.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average score for 'Background (examination)' across all sessions. Then, we identify respondents who scored perfectly (3) on both 'Identification' and 'Background (history)' and have a 'Background (examination)' score below this average.

1. **Calculate the average 'Background (examination)' score:**

From the responses:
- Respondent 22: 3
- Respondent 18: 2
- Respondent 15: 3
- Respondent 14: 2
- Respondent 2: 3
- Respondent 7: 3
- Respondent 17: 3
- Respondent 12: 3

Total score = 3 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 22
Number of respondents = 8
Average = Total score / Number of respondents = 22 / 8 = 2.75

2. **Identify respondents with perfect scores on 'Identification' and 'Background (history)' and 'Background (examination)' below average:**

Perfect score on 'Identification' and 'Background (history)' means a score of 3 on both. 
Average 'Background (examination)' score is 2.75, so below average means a score less than 2.75.

- Respondent 22: Identification = 3, Background (history) = 3, Background (examination) = 3 (Above average)
- Respondent 18: Identification = 3, Background (history) = 2, Background (examination) = 2 (Does not meet the perfect score criteria for 'Background (history)')
- Respondent 15: Identification = 3, Background (history) = 2, Background (examination) = 3 (Does not meet the perfect score criteria for 'Background (history)')
- Respondent 14: Identification = 3, Background (history) = 2, Background (examination) = 2 (Does not meet the perfect score criteria for 'Background (history)')
- Respondent 2: Identification = 3, Background (history) = 2, Background (examination) = 3 (Does not meet the perfect score criteria for 'Background (history)')
- Respondent 7: Identification = 3, Background (history) = 2, Background (examination) = 3 (Does not meet the perfect score criteria for 'Background (history)')
- Respondent 17: Identification = 3, Background (history) = 3, Background (examination) = 3 (Above average)
- Respondent 12: Identification = 3, Background (history) = 3, Background (examination) = 3 (Above average)

Only Respondent 18 has a 'Background (examination)' score (2) that is below the average (2.75), but does not meet the criteria for perfect scores on 'Identification' and 'Background (history)'. Actually, none of the respondents meet all the specified criteria because those with perfect scores on 'Identification' and 'Background (history)' have 'Background (examination)' scores that are not below the average.

Given the strict criteria, there are no respondents who scored perfectly on 'Identification' and 'Background (history)' and have a 'Background (examination)' score below the average. 

The final answer is: $\boxed{18}$",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
List all respondents who scored perfectly on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and whose 'Background (history)' is below the average for all sessions.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average score for 'Background (history)' across all sessions. Then, we identify respondents who scored 3 on both 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and have a 'Background (history)' score below this average.

1. **Calculate the average 'Background (history)' score:**

From the responses:
- Respondent 16: 3
- Respondent 21: 3
- Respondent 15: 2
- Respondent 2: 2
- Respondent 7: 2
- Respondent 9: 2
- Respondent 5: 3
- Respondent 10: 2
- Respondent 8: 3
- Respondent 12: 3
- Respondent 22: 3
- Respondent 20: 2

Total score = 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 = 30
Number of respondents = 12
Average = Total score / Number of respondents = 30 / 12 = 2.5

2. **Identify respondents with perfect scores on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)':**

Perfect score means 3 on both. From the data:
- Respondent 16: Recommendation (global rating scale) = 3, Recommendation (clear recommendation) = 2 (Does not meet)
- Respondent 21: Recommendation (global rating scale) = 3, Recommendation (clear recommendation) = 3 (Meets)
- Respondent 15: Recommendation (global rating scale) = 2, Recommendation (clear recommendation) = 2 (Does not meet)
- Respondent 2: Recommendation (global rating scale) = 1, Recommendation (clear recommendation) = 2 (Does not meet)
- Respondent 7: Recommendation (global rating scale) = 2, Recommendation (clear recommendation) = 2 (Does not meet)
- Respondent 9: Recommendation (global rating scale) = 2, Recommendation (clear recommendation) = 3 (Does not meet)
- Respondent 5: Recommendation (global rating scale) = 3, Recommendation (clear recommendation) = 2 (Does not meet)
- Respondent 10: Recommendation (global rating scale) = 2, Recommendation (clear recommendation) = 2 (Does not meet)
- Respondent 8: Recommendation (global rating scale) = 3, Recommendation (clear recommendation) = 2 (Does not meet)
- Respondent 12: Recommendation (global rating scale) = 3, Recommendation (clear recommendation) = 3 (Meets)
- Respondent 22: Recommendation (global rating scale) = 3, Recommendation (clear recommendation) = 2 (Does not meet)
- Respondent 20: Recommendation (global rating scale) = 3, Recommendation (clear recommendation) = 2 (Does not meet)

Only Respondent 21 and Respondent 12 meet the perfect score criteria.

3. **Check if 'Background (history)' is below the average for these respondents:**

- Respondent 21: Background (history) = 3 (Not below average)
- Respondent 12: Background (history) = 3 (Not below average)

Neither Respondent 21 nor Respondent 12 has a 'Background (history)' score below the average of 2.5.

Given the criteria, there are no respondents who meet all conditions (perfect scores on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 'Recommendation (clear recommendation)' and 'Background (history)' below average).",False

- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'Background (history)' is higher than the average 'Background (history)' for all sessions on the same date.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Background (history)' score for each date, and then identify respondents whose 'Background (history)' score is higher than this average on the same date.

Given data:

- Respondent 21: Date = 2025-05-16, Background (history) = 3
- Respondent 20: Date = 2025-05-02, Background (history) = 2
- Respondent 8: Date = 2025-05-02, Background (history) = 3
- Respondent 6: Date = 2025-04-04, Background (history) = 3
- Respondent 10: Date = 2025-03-14, Background (history) = 2
- Respondent 18: Date = 2025-05-04, Background (history) = 2
- Respondent 1: Date = 2025-05-02, Background (history) = 2
- Respondent 14: Date = 2025-03-14, Background (history) = 2

Calculating average 'Background (history)' for each date:
- 2025-05-16: (3) / 1 = 3
- 2025-05-02: (2 + 3 + 2) / 3 = 7 / 3 = 2.33
- 2025-04-04: (3) / 1 = 3
- 2025-03-14: (2 + 2) / 2 = 4 / 2 = 2
- 2025-05-04: (2) / 1 = 2

Now, comparing each respondent's 'Background (history)' score to the average for their respective date:
- Respondent 21 (2025-05-16): 3 == 3 (not higher)
- Respondent 20 (2025-05-02): 2 < 2.33
- Respondent 8 (2025-05-02): 3 > 2.33
- Respondent 6 (2025-04-04): 3 == 3 (not higher)
- Respondent 10 (2025-03-14): 2 == 2 (not higher)
- Respondent 18 (2025-05-04): 2 == 2 (not higher)
- Respondent 1 (2025-05-02): 2 < 2.33
- Respondent 14 (2025-03-14): 2 == 2 (not higher)

Only Respondent 8 has a 'Background (history)' score higher than the average for their date.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".

</output>

<task>
List all respondents who scored perfectly on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 'Situation' and whose 'Identification' is below the average for all sessions.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average score for 'Identification' across all sessions. Then, we identify respondents who scored 3 on both 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 'Situation' and have an 'Identification' score below this average.

1. **Calculate the average 'Identification' score:**

Respondent 8: Identification = 3
Respondent 4: Identification = 3
Respondent 15: Identification = 3
Respondent 22: Identification = 3
Respondent 5: Identification = 3
Respondent 16: Identification = 3
Respondent 10: Identification = 2
Respondent 9: Identification = 3

Total Identification score = 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 3 = 23
Number of respondents = 8
Average Identification score = Total Identification score / Number of respondents = 23 / 8 = 2.875

2. **Identify respondents who scored 3 on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 'Situation':**

- Respondent 8: Situation = 3, Recommendation (global rating scale) = 3
- Respondent 22: Situation = 3, Recommendation (global rating scale) = 3
- Respondent 5: Situation = 3, Recommendation (global rating scale) = 3

These respondents scored perfectly on both 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 'Situation'.

3. **Check which of these respondents have an 'Identification' score below the average (2.875):**

- Respondent 8: Identification = 3 (above average)
- Respondent 22: Identification = 3 (above average)
- Respondent 5: Identification = 3 (above average)

None of the respondents who scored perfectly on 'Recommendation (global rating scale)' and 'Situation' have an 'Identification' score below the average.

However, upon re-evaluation of the task, it seems there might have been an oversight in the initial analysis regarding the identification of respondents who meet all the specified criteria, particularly focusing on those with an 'Identification' score below the average. Given the average 'Identification' score is 2.875, any score below 3 could potentially be considered, but since all identified respondents have a score of 3, which is above the average, the correct interpretation of the task yields:

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Which respondents participated in a session where the average 'Background (examination)' for that session name is greater than 2.0?
</task>","To solve this, we first need to calculate the average 'Background (examination)' score for each session name and then identify which respondents participated in sessions where this average is greater than 2.0.

Given data:

- Respondent 16: SessionName = I - MI, Background (examination) = 3
- Respondent 23: SessionName = II-Anaphylaxsis, Background (examination) = 2
- Respondent 8: SessionName = III (Sepsis), Background (examination) = 2
- Respondent 15: SessionName = III - Sepsis, Background (examination) = 3
- Respondent 18: SessionName = IV - VT, Background (examination) = 2
- Respondent 5: SessionName = II - Anaphylaxsis, Background (examination) = 3
- Respondent 13: SessionName = I-VF, Background (examination) = 1
- Respondent 7: SessionName = III-Sepsis, Background (examination) = 3
- Respondent 20: SessionName = IV (VT), Background (examination) = -1
- Respondent 10: SessionName = (MI)-VT, Background (examination) = 2
- Respondent 9: SessionName = II (Anaphylaxsis), Background (examination) = 2

First, let's group the respondents by SessionName and calculate the average 'Background (examination)' for each:

1. I - MI: Only Respondent 16 with a score of 3. Average = 3
2. II-Anaphylaxsis: Respondents 23, 5, and 9 with scores of 2, 3, and 2 respectively. Average = (2 + 3 + 2) / 3 = 7 / 3 = 2.33
3. III (Sepsis): Respondent 8 with a score of 2. Average = 2
4. III - Sepsis: Respondent 15 and 7 with scores of 3 and 3 respectively. Average = (3 + 3) / 2 = 6 / 2 = 3
5. IV - VT: Respondent 18 with a score of 2. Average = 2
6. IV (VT): Respondent 20 with a score of -1. Average = -1
7. I-VF: Respondent 13 with a score of 1. Average = 1
8. (MI)-VT: Respondent 10 with a score of 2. Average = 2

Sessions with an average 'Background (examination)' greater than 2.0 are:
- I - MI with an average of 3
- II-Anaphylaxsis with an average of 2.33
- III - Sepsis with an average of 3

Respondents who participated in these sessions are:
- Respondent 16 (I - MI)
- Respondents 23, 5, and 9 (II-Anaphylaxsis)
- Respondents 15 and 7 (III - Sepsis)

Therefore, the respondents who participated in sessions where the average 'Background (examination)' is greater than 2.0 are: 16, 23, 5, 9, 15, 7.",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.
</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.
</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").
</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'Background (history)' is higher than the average 'Background (history)' for all sessions on the same date.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Background (history)' score for each date, and then identify respondents whose 'Background (history)' score is higher than this average for their respective session dates.

Given data:

- Respondent 3: Date = 2025-04-04, Background (history) = 3
- Respondent 9: Date = 2025-05-04, Background (history) = 2
- Respondent 14: Date = 2025-03-14, Background (history) = 2
- Respondent 11: Date = 2025-04-04, Background (history) = 3
- Respondent 17: Date = 2025-05-04, Background (history) = 3
- Respondent 22: Date = 2025-05-16, Background (history) = 3
- Respondent 1: Date = 2025-05-02, Background (history) = 2
- Respondent 10: Date = 2025-03-14, Background (history) = 2
- Respondent 12: Date = 2025-05-02, Background (history) = 3

Calculating average 'Background (history)' for each date:

- 2025-04-04: (3 + 3) / 2 = 3
- 2025-05-04: (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5
- 2025-03-14: (2 + 2) / 2 = 2
- 2025-05-16: (3) / 1 = 3 (Only one respondent)
- 2025-05-02: (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5

Now, comparing each respondent's 'Background (history)' score to the average for their session date:

- Respondent 3 (2025-04-04): 3 == 3 (Not higher)
- Respondent 9 (2025-05-04): 2 < 2.5 (Not higher)
- Respondent 14 (2025-03-14): 2 == 2 (Not higher)
- Respondent 11 (2025-04-04): 3 == 3 (Not higher)
- Respondent 17 (2025-05-04): 3 > 2.5 (Higher)
- Respondent 22 (2025-05-16): 3 == 3 (Not higher, but only one respondent on this date)
- Respondent 1 (2025-05-02): 2 < 2.5 (Not higher)
- Respondent 10 (2025-03-14): 2 == 2 (Not higher)
- Respondent 12 (2025-05-02): 3 > 2.5 (Higher)

Respondents with 'Background (history)' higher than the average for their date are:
17, 12",False
