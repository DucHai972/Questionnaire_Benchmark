<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
How many respondents from the 'Intern' rated 'Ease_of_Learning' as 3?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to identify respondents who belong to the 'Intern' group and have rated 'Ease_of_Learning' as 3.

From the 'questions' section, we understand that 'Group' is a field with options A. Senior, B. Junior, C. Middle, D. Intern, and 'Ease_of_Learning' is rated on a Likert scale of 1-5.

Looking at the 'responses' section:

- Respondent 31: Group D (Intern), Ease_of_Learning: 3
- Respondent 48: Group D (Intern), Ease_of_Learning: 5
- Respondent 78: Group D (Intern), Ease_of_Learning: 3

Only Respondent 31 and Respondent 78 match the criteria of being from the 'Intern' group and rating 'Ease_of_Learning' as 3.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

From the provided data:

- Respondent 18: Group D
- Respondent 90: Group D
- Respondent 84: Group D
- Respondent 45: Group D
- Respondent 30: Group D

There are 5 respondents with 'D' as their group, which corresponds to the 'Intern' group according to the schema.

The final answer is: 5",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

Count the respondents whose combined score for 'Frequent_Usage' and 'Ease_of_Learning' is less than 6.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to examine each respondent's scores for 'Frequent_Usage' and 'Ease_of_Learning', add these two scores together, and then count how many of these combined scores are less than 6.

Let's calculate the combined scores:

- Respondent 84: Frequent_Usage = 3, Ease_of_Learning = 2, Combined = 5
- Respondent 62: Frequent_Usage = 1, Ease_of_Learning = 1, Combined = 2
- Respondent 90: Frequent_Usage = 5, Ease_of_Learning = 5, Combined = 10
- Respondent 36: Frequent_Usage = 1, Ease_of_Learning = 5, Combined = 6
- Respondent 37: Frequent_Usage = 4, Ease_of_Learning = 5, Combined = 9

Now, let's count the respondents whose combined score is less than 6:

- Respondent 84 has a combined score of 5, which is less than 6.
- Respondent 62 has a combined score of 2, which is less than 6.
- Respondent 36 has a combined score of 6, which is not less than 6.
- Respondent 90 and Respondent 37 also have scores not less than 6.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").

<task>
Count the respondents whose combined score for 'Frequent_Usage' and 'Need_for_Technical_Support' is less than 6.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to examine each respondent's scores for 'Frequent_Usage' and 'Need_for_Technical_Support', add these scores together, and then count how many of these combined scores are less than 6.

Let's calculate the combined scores:

1. Respondent 70: Frequent_Usage = 5, Need_for_Technical_Support = 1, Combined = 6
2. Respondent 38: Frequent_Usage = 3, Need_for_Technical_Support = 3, Combined = 6
3. Respondent 79: Frequent_Usage = 5, Need_for_Technical_Support = 2, Combined = 7
4. Respondent 4: Frequent_Usage = 4, Need_for_Technical_Support = 1, Combined = 5
5. Respondent 80: Frequent_Usage = 5, Need_for_Technical_Support = 3, Combined = 8

Now, let's count the respondents whose combined score is less than 6:

- Respondent 4 has a combined score of 5, which is less than 6.

Therefore, there is 1 respondent whose combined score for 'Frequent_Usage' and 'Need_for_Technical_Support' is less than 6.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose combined score for 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' and 'Frequent_Usage' is less than 3.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to examine each respondent's scores for 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' and 'Frequent_Usage', add these scores together, and then count how many of these combined scores are less than 3.

Let's calculate the combined scores:

1. Respondent 74: Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = 1, Frequent_Usage = 5, Combined = 6
2. Respondent 22: Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = 2, Frequent_Usage = 1, Combined = 3
3. Respondent 81: Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = 2, Frequent_Usage = 1, Combined = 3
4. Respondent 30: Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = 1, Frequent_Usage = 3, Combined = 4
5. Respondent 36: Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = 1, Frequent_Usage = 1, Combined = 2
6. Respondent 62: Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = 1, Frequent_Usage = 1, Combined = 2
7. Respondent 84: Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = 1, Frequent_Usage = 3, Combined = 4
8. Respondent 69: Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = 1, Frequent_Usage = 3, Combined = 4

Now, let's count the respondents whose combined score is less than 3:
- Respondent 36 has a combined score of 2.
- Respondent 62 has a combined score of 2.

Therefore, there are 2 respondents whose combined score for 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' and 'Frequent_Usage' is less than 3.",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose combined score for 'Ease_of_Use' and 'Frequent_Usage' is less than 8.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to go through each respondent's data, add their scores for 'Ease_of_Use' and 'Frequent_Usage', and then count how many of these sums are less than 8.

1. Respondent 71: Ease_of_Use = 5, Frequent_Usage = 3, Sum = 8
2. Respondent 43: Ease_of_Use = 5, Frequent_Usage = 3, Sum = 8
3. Respondent 17: Ease_of_Use = 5, Frequent_Usage = 5, Sum = 10
4. Respondent 44: Ease_of_Use = 5, Frequent_Usage = 3, Sum = 8
5. Respondent 20: Ease_of_Use = 5, Frequent_Usage = 1, Sum = 6
6. Respondent 37: Ease_of_Use = 5, Frequent_Usage = 4, Sum = 9
7. Respondent 56: Ease_of_Use = 4, Frequent_Usage = 5, Sum = 9
8. Respondent 33: Ease_of_Use = 5, Frequent_Usage = 3, Sum = 8
9. Respondent 73: Ease_of_Use = 4, Frequent_Usage = 1, Sum = 5
10. Respondent 8: Ease_of_Use = 2, Frequent_Usage = 2, Sum = 4
11. Respondent 68: Ease_of_Use = 4, Frequent_Usage = 4, Sum = 8
12. Respondent 36: Ease_of_Use = 5, Frequent_Usage = 1, Sum = 6

Now, let's count the sums that are less than 8:
- Respondent 20: Sum = 6
- Respondent 73: Sum = 5
- Respondent 8: Sum = 4
- Respondent 36: Sum = 6

There are 4 respondents whose combined score for 'Ease_of_Use' and 'Frequent_Usage' is less than 8.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose combined score for 'Need_for_Technical_Support' and 'Inconsistency' is less than 2.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to examine each respondent's scores for 'Need_for_Technical_Support' and 'Inconsistency', add these scores together, and then count how many of these combined scores are less than 2.

Let's calculate the combined scores:

1. Respondent 82: Need_for_Technical_Support = 1, Inconsistency = 1, Combined = 1 + 1 = 2
2. Respondent 54: Need_for_Technical_Support = 3, Inconsistency = 1, Combined = 3 + 1 = 4
3. Respondent 55: Need_for_Technical_Support = 1, Inconsistency = 1, Combined = 1 + 1 = 2
4. Respondent 14: Need_for_Technical_Support = 1, Inconsistency = 1, Combined = 1 + 1 = 2
5. Respondent 9: Need_for_Technical_Support = 5, Inconsistency = 5, Combined = 5 + 5 = 10
6. Respondent 47: Need_for_Technical_Support = 1, Inconsistency = 1, Combined = 1 + 1 = 2
7. Respondent 90: Need_for_Technical_Support = 2, Inconsistency = 2, Combined = 2 + 2 = 4
8. Respondent 60: Need_for_Technical_Support = 1, Inconsistency = 2, Combined = 1 + 2 = 3
9. Respondent 48: Need_for_Technical_Support = 1, Inconsistency = 1, Combined = 1 + 1 = 2
10. Respondent 6: Need_for_Technical_Support = 1, Inconsistency = 1, Combined = 1 + 1 = 2
11. Respondent 78: Need_for_Technical_Support = 4, Inconsistency = 4, Combined = 4 + 4 = 8

From these calculations, we see that none of the respondents have a combined score less than 2.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who are in a group where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'System_Complexity' and 'Ease_of_Use' scores for each group, and then compare these averages to determine which groups have a higher average 'System_Complexity' score. Finally, we count the respondents in those groups.

Given the data:

1. Respondent 49: Group D, System_Complexity: 5, Ease_of_Use: 5
2. Respondent 43: Group C, System_Complexity: 1, Ease_of_Use: 5
3. Respondent 30: Group D, System_Complexity: 1, Ease_of_Use: 5
4. Respondent 22: Group C, System_Complexity: 2, Ease_of_Use: 4
5. Respondent 50: Group C, System_Complexity: 1, Ease_of_Use: 5
6. Respondent 74: Group D, System_Complexity: 1, Ease_of_Use: 5
7. Respondent 89: Group A, System_Complexity: 2, Ease_of_Use: 3
8. Respondent 37: Group C, System_Complexity: 1, Ease_of_Use: 5
9. Respondent 71: Group D, System_Complexity: 1, Ease_of_Use: 5
10. Respondent 36: Group B, System_Complexity: 1, Ease_of_Use: 5

Let's calculate the averages for each group:

- Group A: System_Complexity = 2, Ease_of_Use = 3 (1 respondent)
- Group B: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5 (1 respondent)
- Group C: System_Complexity = (1+2+1+1)/4 = 1.25, Ease_of_Use = (5+4+5+5)/4 = 4.75 (4 respondents)
- Group D: System_Complexity = (5+1+1+1+1)/5 = 1.8, Ease_of_Use = (5+5+5+5+5)/5 = 5 (5 respondents)

Comparing the averages:
- Group A: System_Complexity (2) > Ease_of_Use (3) is False
- Group B: System_Complexity (1) > Ease_of_Use (5) is False
- Group C: System_Complexity (1.25) > Ease_of_Use (4.75) is False
- Group D: System_Complexity (1.8) > Ease_of_Use (5) is False

Only Group A has a scenario where the System_Complexity score is higher than the Ease_of_Use score, but upon reviewing the calculation, it's clear that the initial assessment for Group A was incorrect based on the provided data. The correct comparison shows that in none of the groups is the average 'System_Complexity' score higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score.

Therefore, the count of respondents in groups where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score is 0.",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents in the 'Junior' group have a 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score that is higher than the average 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' for the 'Intern' group?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score for the 'Intern' group. Then, we will identify the respondents in the 'Junior' group and check how many of them have a 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score higher than this average.

1. **Identify 'Intern' group respondents and their 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' scores:**
   - Respondent 15: Group D (Intern), Need_to_Learn_Before_Use: 2
   - Respondent 29: Group D (Intern), Need_to_Learn_Before_Use: 1
   - Respondent 18: Group D (Intern), Need_to_Learn_Before_Use: 1
   - Respondent 12: Group D (Intern), Need_to_Learn_Before_Use: 2

2. **Calculate the average 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score for the 'Intern' group:**
   - Average = (2 + 1 + 1 + 2) / 4 = 6 / 4 = 1.5

3. **Identify 'Junior' group respondents and their 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' scores:**
   - Respondent 36: Group B (Junior), Need_to_Learn_Before_Use: 1
   - Respondent 32: Group B (Junior), Need_to_Learn_Before_Use: 1
   - Respondent 14: Group B (Junior), Need_to_Learn_Before_Use: 3

4. **Determine how many 'Junior' group respondents have a 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score higher than the average for the 'Intern' group (1.5):**
   - Respondent 14 has a score of 3, which is higher than 1.5.
   - Respondents 36 and 32 have scores of 1, which is not higher than 1.5.

Therefore, there is **1** respondent in the 'Junior' group with a 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score higher than the average for the 'Intern' group.",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
How many respondents in the 'Intern' group have a 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score that is higher than the average 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' for the 'Senior' group?
</task>","To solve this, we first need to calculate the average 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score for the 'Senior' group and then find out how many respondents in the 'Intern' group have a score higher than this average.

1. **Identify 'Senior' group respondents and their 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' scores:**
   - Respondent 86: Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = 2
   - Respondent 13: Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = 1
   - Respondent 59: Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = 1

2. **Calculate the average 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score for the 'Senior' group:**
   - Average = (2 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 4 / 3 = 1.33

3. **Identify 'Intern' group respondents and their 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' scores:**
   - Respondent 90: Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = 1
   - Respondent 60: Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = 2
   - Respondent 48: Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = 1
   - Respondent 77: Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = 1
   - Respondent 64: Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = 5
   - Respondent 78: Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = 5

4. **Count 'Intern' group respondents with 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score higher than the 'Senior' group average (1.33):**
   - Respondent 60: 2 (higher than 1.33)
   - Respondent 64: 5 (higher than 1.33)
   - Respondent 78: 5 (higher than 1.33)

Therefore, there are **3** respondents in the 'Intern' group with a 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score higher than the average for the 'Senior' group.",True

  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the respondents who are in a group where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'System_Complexity' and 'Ease_of_Use' scores for each group, and then compare these averages to determine which groups have a higher average 'System_Complexity' score. Finally, we count the respondents in those groups.

From the provided data:

- Respondent 53: Group C, System_Complexity: 1, Ease_of_Use: 5
- Respondent 67: Group A, System_Complexity: 1, Ease_of_Use: 5
- Respondent 70: Group C, System_Complexity: 1, Ease_of_Use: 5
- Respondent 90: Group D, System_Complexity: 1, Ease_of_Use: 5
- Respondent 15: Group D, System_Complexity: 2, Ease_of_Use: 4
- Respondent 23: Group B, System_Complexity: 1, Ease_of_Use: 4
- Respondent 49: Group D, System_Complexity: 5, Ease_of_Use: 5
- Respondent 29: Group D, System_Complexity: 1, Ease_of_Use: 4

Let's calculate the averages for each group:

- Group A: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5 (only 1 respondent)
- Group B: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 4 (only 1 respondent)
- Group C: System_Complexity = (1+1)/2 = 1, Ease_of_Use = (5+5)/2 = 5 (2 respondents)
- Group D: System_Complexity = (1+2+5+1)/4 = 9/4 = 2.25, Ease_of_Use = (5+4+5+4)/4 = 18/4 = 4.5 (4 respondents)

Comparing the averages:
- Group A: System_Complexity (1) < Ease_of_Use (5)
- Group B: System_Complexity (1) < Ease_of_Use (4)
- Group C: System_Complexity (1) < Ease_of_Use (5)
- Group D: System_Complexity (2.25) < Ease_of_Use (4.5)

There are no groups where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score. Therefore, the count of respondents in such groups is 0.",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
How many respondents have a total positive usability score ('Ease_of_Use' + 'Integration_of_Functions') that is lower than the average for all respondents not in their group?
</task>","To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the average total positive usability score for each group, and then compare each respondent's score to the average of the other groups.

1. Calculate the total positive usability score for each respondent: 'Ease_of_Use' + 'Integration_of_Functions'.

2. Calculate the average total positive usability score for each group.

3. For each respondent, calculate the average total positive usability score of the groups they are not in.

4. Compare each respondent's score to the average of the other groups and count how many have a lower score.

Let's start by calculating the total positive usability score for each respondent:

- Respondent 35: 1 (Ease_of_Use) + 1 (Integration_of_Functions) = 2
- Respondent 54: 5 + 5 = 10
- Respondent 63: 5 + 5 = 10
- Respondent 33: 5 + 5 = 10
- Respondent 11: 5 + 5 = 10
- Respondent 39: 1 + 5 = 6
- Respondent 44: 5 + 2 = 7
- Respondent 3: 3 + 2 = 5
- Respondent 10: 4 + 5 = 9
- Respondent 62: 5 + 4 = 9

Next, let's group the respondents by their group and calculate the average total positive usability score for each group:

- Group A: (2 + 10) / 2 = 12 / 2 = 6
- Group B: (7 + 5) / 2 = 12 / 2 = 6
- Group C: (10 + 10 + 10 + 6 + 9) / 5 = 45 / 5 = 9
- Group D: 9 / 1 = 9

Now, let's calculate the average total positive usability score for the groups each respondent is not in:

- Respondent 35 (Group A): (10 + 10 + 10 + 6 + 9 + 7 + 5 + 9) / 8 = 66 / 8 = 8.25
- Respondent 54 (Group C): (2 + 10 + 7 + 5 + 9) / 5 = 33 / 5 = 6.6
- Respondent 63 (Group C): (2 + 10 + 7 + 5 + 9) / 5 = 33 / 5 = 6.6
- Respondent 33 (Group C): (2 + 10 + 7 + 5 + 9) / 5 = 33 / 5 = 6.6
- Respondent 11 (Group A): (10 + 10 + 10 + 6 + 9 + 7 + 5 + 9) / 8 = 66 / 8 = 8.25
- Respondent 39 (Group C): (2 + 10 + 7 + 5 + 9) / 5 = 33 / 5 = 6.6
- Respondent 44 (Group B): (2 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 6 + 9 + 9) / 8 = 66 / 8 = 8.25
- Respondent 3 (Group B): (2 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 6 + 9 + 9) / 8 = 66 / 8 = 8.25
- Respondent 10 (Group D): (2 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 6 + 7 + 5 + 9 + 9) / 10 = 78 / 10 = 7.8
- Respondent 62 (Group C): (2 + 10 + 7 + 5 + 9) / 5 = 33 / 5 = 6.6

Finally, let's compare each respondent's score to the average of the other groups:

- Respondent 35: 2 < 8.25
- Respondent 54: 10 > 6.6
- Respondent 63: 10 > 6.6
- Respondent 33: 10 > 6.6
- Respondent 11: 10 > 8.25
- Respondent 39: 6 < 6.6
- Respondent 44: 7 < 8.25
- Respondent 3: 5 < 8.25
- Respondent 10: 9 > 7.8
- Respondent 62: 9 > 6.6

Counting the respondents with a lower score than the average of the other groups: 4 (Respondent 35, Respondent 39, Respondent 44, Respondent 3).

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who are in a group where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'System_Complexity' and 'Ease_of_Use' scores for each group, and then compare these averages to determine which groups have a higher average 'System_Complexity' score. Finally, we count the respondents in those groups.

Given data:

- Respondent 10: Group D, System_Complexity: 1, Ease_of_Use: 4
- Respondent 52: Group A, System_Complexity: 1, Ease_of_Use: 4
- Respondent 6: Group A, System_Complexity: 1, Ease_of_Use: 4
- Respondent 76: Group A, System_Complexity: 1, Ease_of_Use: 5
- Respondent 30: Group D, System_Complexity: 1, Ease_of_Use: 5
- Respondent 82: Group C, System_Complexity: 1, Ease_of_Use: 4
- Respondent 67: Group A, System_Complexity: 1, Ease_of_Use: 5
- Respondent 20: Group C, System_Complexity: 1, Ease_of_Use: 5

Calculating averages for each group:

- Group A: 
  - System_Complexity: (1 + 1 + 1 + 1) / 4 = 1
  - Ease_of_Use: (4 + 4 + 5 + 5) / 4 = 4.5
- Group C: 
  - System_Complexity: (1 + 1) / 2 = 1
  - Ease_of_Use: (4 + 5) / 2 = 4.5
- Group D: 
  - System_Complexity: (1 + 1) / 2 = 1
  - Ease_of_Use: (4 + 5) / 2 = 4.5

No group has a higher average 'System_Complexity' score than its average 'Ease_of_Use' score. Therefore, the count of respondents in such groups is 0.",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who are in a group where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'System_Complexity' and 'Ease_of_Use' scores for each group. Then, we compare these averages to identify groups where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score. Finally, we count the respondents in these groups.

Let's calculate the averages for each group based on the provided responses:

1. Group A:
   - Respondent 46: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 1
   - Respondent 56: System_Complexity = 2, Ease_of_Use = 4
   - Respondent 59: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
   - Average System_Complexity = (1 + 2 + 1) / 3 = 4 / 3 = 1.33
   - Average Ease_of_Use = (1 + 4 + 5) / 3 = 10 / 3 = 3.33

2. Group B:
   - Respondent 44: System_Complexity = 2, Ease_of_Use = 5
   - Respondent 66: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
   - Respondent 79: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
   - Average System_Complexity = (2 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 4 / 3 = 1.33
   - Average Ease_of_Use = (5 + 5 + 5) / 3 = 15 / 3 = 5

3. Group C:
   - Respondent 9: System_Complexity = 3, Ease_of_Use = 1
   - Respondent 33: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
   - Respondent 50: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
   - Respondent 51: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
   - Average System_Complexity = (3 + 1 + 1 + 1) / 4 = 6 / 4 = 1.5
   - Average Ease_of_Use = (1 + 5 + 5 + 5) / 4 = 16 / 4 = 4

4. Group D:
   - Respondent 71: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
   - Respondent 74: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
   - Average System_Complexity = (1 + 1) / 2 = 2 / 2 = 1
   - Average Ease_of_Use = (5 + 5) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5

Comparing the averages:
- Group A: Average System_Complexity (1.33) < Average Ease_of_Use (3.33)
- Group B: Average System_Complexity (1.33) < Average Ease_of_Use (5)
- Group C: Average System_Complexity (1.5) < Average Ease_of_Use (4)
- Group D: Average System_Complexity (1) < Average Ease_of_Use (5)

There are no groups where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score. Therefore, the count of respondents in such groups is 0.",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who are in a group where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'System_Complexity' and 'Ease_of_Use' scores for each group, and then compare these averages to determine which groups have a higher average 'System_Complexity' score. Finally, we count the respondents in those groups.

From the provided data:

- Respondent 71: Group D, System_Complexity: 1, Ease_of_Use: 5
- Respondent 41: Group D, System_Complexity: 1, Ease_of_Use: 5
- Respondent 17: Group C, System_Complexity: 1, Ease_of_Use: 5
- Respondent 72: Group A, System_Complexity: 1, Ease_of_Use: 5
- Respondent 69: Group B, System_Complexity: 4, Ease_of_Use: 5
- Respondent 39: Group C, System_Complexity: 4, Ease_of_Use: 1
- Respondent 65: Group A, System_Complexity: 1, Ease_of_Use: 5
- Respondent 25: Group D, System_Complexity: 3, Ease_of_Use: 3

Let's calculate the averages for each group:

### Group A
- System_Complexity: (1 + 1) / 2 = 2 / 2 = 1
- Ease_of_Use: (5 + 5) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5
Since 1 < 5, the average 'System_Complexity' is not higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' in Group A.

### Group B
- System_Complexity: 4
- Ease_of_Use: 5
Since 4 < 5, the average 'System_Complexity' is not higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' in Group B.

### Group C
- System_Complexity: (1 + 4) / 2 = 5 / 2 = 2.5
- Ease_of_Use: (5 + 1) / 2 = 6 / 2 = 3
Since 2.5 < 3, the average 'System_Complexity' is not higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' in Group C.

### Group D
- System_Complexity: (1 + 1 + 3) / 3 = 5 / 3 ≈ 1.67
- Ease_of_Use: (5 + 5 + 3) / 3 = 13 / 3 ≈ 4.33
Since 1.67 < 4.33, the average 'System_Complexity' is not higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' in Group D.

Upon reviewing the calculations, it appears there was an oversight in the comparison for Group C. Let's correct that:

### Group C
- System_Complexity: 2.5
- Ease_of_Use: 3
Here, the average 'System_Complexity' (2.5) is indeed less than the average 'Ease_of_Use' (3), so Group C does not meet the criteria.

Actually, upon reevaluation, none of the groups have an average 'System_Complexity' score higher than their average 'Ease_of_Use' score based on the provided calculations. Therefore, the count of respondents in groups where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score is 0. 

The final answer is: $\boxed{0}$",True

<task>
Count the respondents who are in a group where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'System_Complexity' and 'Ease_of_Use' scores for each group. Then, we compare these averages to determine in which groups the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score. Finally, we count the respondents in those groups.

Let's calculate the averages for each group based on the provided responses:

1. **Group A**:
   - Respondent 42: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
   - Respondent 6: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 4
   - Average System_Complexity = (1 + 1) / 2 = 1
   - Average Ease_of_Use = (5 + 4) / 2 = 4.5
   - Since 1 < 4.5, the average 'System_Complexity' is not higher.

2. **Group B**:
   - Respondent 66: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
   - Respondent 36: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
   - Average System_Complexity = (1 + 1) / 2 = 1
   - Average Ease_of_Use = (5 + 5) / 2 = 5
   - Since 1 < 5, the average 'System_Complexity' is not higher.

3. **Group C**:

   - Average System_Complexity = (3 + 1 + 2) / 3 = 2
   - Average Ease_of_Use = (1 + 5 + 5) / 3 = 3.67

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have a total positive usability score ('Ease_of_Use' + 'Integration_of_Functions') that is lower than the average for all respondents not in their group?
</task>","To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the average total positive usability score for each group and then compare each respondent's score to the average of the other groups.

1. **Calculate Total Positive Usability Score for Each Respondent:**
   - This score is the sum of 'Ease_of_Use' and 'Integration_of_Functions' for each respondent.

2. **Calculate Average Total Positive Usability Score for Each Group:**
   - We need to calculate the average score for respondents in each group (A, B, C, D) separately.

3. **Compare Each Respondent's Score to the Average of the Other Groups:**
   - For each respondent, we will calculate the average total positive usability score of all respondents not in their group.
   - Then, we compare this average to the respondent's own score.

Let's calculate:

### Step 1: Calculate Total Positive Usability Score for Each Respondent

- Respondent 64: 2 (Ease_of_Use) + 2 (Integration_of_Functions) = 4, Group: D
- Respondent 35: 1 + 1 = 2, Group: A
- Respondent 47: 4 + 5 = 9, Group: B
- Respondent 82: 4 + 4 = 8, Group: C
- Respondent 32: 5 + 5 = 10, Group: B
- Respondent 89: 3 + 5 = 8, Group: A
- Respondent 61: 2 + 1 = 3, Group: B
- Respondent 43: 5 + 5 = 10, Group: C
- Respondent 11: 5 + 5 = 10, Group: A

### Step 2: Calculate Average Total Positive Usability Score for Each Group

- Group A: (2 + 8 + 10) / 3 = 20 / 3 ≈ 6.67
- Group B: (9 + 10 + 3) / 3 = 22 / 3 ≈ 7.33
- Group C: (8 + 10) / 2 = 18 / 2 = 9
- Group D: 4 (only one respondent)

### Step 3: Compare Each Respondent's Score to the Average of the Other Groups

- Respondent 64 (Group D): Average of other groups = (6.67 + 7.33 + 9) / 3 = 23 / 3 ≈ 7.67. Since 4 < 7.67, this respondent meets the condition.
- Respondent 35 (Group A): Average of other groups = (7.33 + 9 + 4) / 3 = 20.33 / 3 ≈ 6.78. Since 2 < 6.78, this respondent meets the condition.
- Respondent 47 (Group B): Average of other groups = (6.67 + 9 + 4) / 3 = 19.67 / 3 ≈ 6.56. Since 9 > 6.56, this respondent does not meet the condition.
- Respondent 82 (Group C): Average of other groups = (6.67 + 7.33 + 4) / 3 = 18 / 3 = 6. Since 8 > 6, this respondent does not meet the condition.
- Respondent 32 (Group B): Same calculation as Respondent 47. Since 10 > 6.56, this respondent does not meet the condition.
- Respondent 89 (Group A): Average of other groups = (7.33 + 9 + 4) / 3 = 20.33 / 3 ≈ 6.78. Since 8 > 6.78, this respondent does not meet the condition.
- Respondent 61 (Group B): Same calculation as Respondent 47. Since 3 < 6.56, this respondent meets the condition.
- Respondent 43 (Group C): Same calculation as Respondent 82. Since 10 > 6, this respondent does not meet the condition.
- Respondent 11 (Group A): Same calculation as Respondent 35. Since 10 > 6.78, this respondent does not meet the condition.

### Respondents Meeting the Condition

- Respondent 64
- Respondent 35
- Respondent 61

There are **3** respondents whose total positive usability score is lower than the average for all respondents not in their group.",True
