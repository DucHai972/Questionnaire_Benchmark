</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</task>","To answer this question, we need to analyze the 'responses' section of the given dataset and find the respondents who belong to the 'Intern' group and rated 'Ease_of_Learning' as 3.

From the 'questions' schema, we know that the 'Group' is categorized as ""[MCQ: A. Senior B. Junior C. Middle D. Intern]"". So, we are looking for respondents with 'Group' answer as 'D'.

Upon examining the 'responses' section, we find the following respondents who belong to the 'Intern' group ('Group' answer is 'D'):

- Respondent id=""31""
- Respondent id=""48""
- Respondent id=""78""

Now, we need to check the 'Ease_of_Learning' rating for these respondents:

- Respondent id=""31"" rated 'Ease_of_Learning' as 3.
- Respondent id=""48"" rated 'Ease_of_Learning' as 5.
- Respondent id=""78"" rated 'Ease_of_Learning' as 3.

Therefore, the number of respondents from the 'Intern' group who rated 'Ease_of_Learning' as 3 is 2.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents from the 'Senior' rated 'Integration_of_Functions' as 3?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to analyze the 'responses' section of the given dataset and find the respondents who belong to the 'Senior' group and rated 'Integration_of_Functions' as 3.

From the 'questions' schema, we know that the 'Group' question is a multiple-choice question with options A. Senior, B. Junior, C. Middle, and D. Intern. We are interested in respondents who answered 'A' (which corresponds to 'Senior').

Looking at the 'responses' section, we find the following respondents who belong to the 'Senior' group (i.e., their answer to the 'Group' question is 'A'):

- Respondent 58
- Respondent 72
- Respondent 76

Now, we need to check how these respondents rated 'Integration_of_Functions'. 

- Respondent 58 rated 'Integration_of_Functions' as 3.
- Respondent 72 rated 'Integration_of_Functions' as 5.
- Respondent 76 rated 'Integration_of_Functions' as 4.

Only Respondent 58 rated 'Integration_of_Functions' as 3.

Therefore, the number of respondents from the 'Senior' group who rated 'Integration_of_Functions' as 3 is 1.",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents are in the 'Junior' group?
</task>","To determine the number of respondents in the 'Junior' group, we first need to identify the code associated with 'Junior' in the schema. According to the 'questions' section, the schema for the ""Group"" question is ""[MCQ: A. Senior B. Junior C. Middle D. Intern]"". This means 'Junior' is associated with the code ""B"".

Next, we examine the 'responses' section to find all respondents who answered ""B"" to the ""Group"" question. The relevant answers are:

- Respondent ""61"" answered ""B"".
- Respondent ""68"" answered ""B"".

Therefore, there are 2 respondents in the 'Junior' group.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents from the 'Junior' rated 'Integration_of_Functions' as 4?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to analyze the 'responses' section of the dataset and find the respondents who belong to the 'Junior' group and rated 'Integration_of_Functions' as 4.

According to the 'questions' schema, the 'Group' question has the following options:
[MCQ: A. Senior B. Junior C. Middle D. Intern]

We are looking for respondents who answered 'B' (Junior) to the 'Group' question and answered 4 to the 'Integration_of_Functions' question.

After analyzing the 'responses' section, we found that only one respondent (id=""26"") belongs to the 'Junior' group, but they rated 'Integration_of_Functions' as 4. 

Therefore, the answer is: 1",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents are in the 'Intern' group?
</task>","To determine the number of respondents in the 'Intern' group, we need to look at the 'responses' section of the data and find all instances where the answer to the ""Group"" question is 'D', since according to the 'questions' schema, 'D' corresponds to 'Intern'.

From the provided data:

- Respondent 18 is in group 'D'.
- Respondent 90 is in group 'D'.
- Respondent 84 is in group 'D'.
- Respondent 45 is in group 'D'.
- Respondent 30 is in group 'D'.

Therefore, there are 5 respondents in the 'Intern' group.",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose combined score for 'Frequent_Usage' and 'Ease_of_Learning' is less than 6.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to iterate through each respondent's answers in the 'responses' section and check their scores for 'Frequent_Usage' and 'Ease_of_Learning'. We then sum these scores and check if the total is less than 6. If it is, we count this respondent.

Let's examine the responses:

1. Respondent 84: 'Frequent_Usage' = 3, 'Ease_of_Learning' = 2. Total = 5 (less than 6).
2. Respondent 62: 'Frequent_Usage' = 1, 'Ease_of_Learning' = 1. Total = 2 (less than 6).
3. Respondent 90: 'Frequent_Usage' = 5, 'Ease_of_Learning' = 5. Total = 10 (not less than 6).
4. Respondent 36: 'Frequent_Usage' = 1, 'Ease_of_Learning' = 5. Total = 6 (not less than 6).
5. Respondent 37: 'Frequent_Usage' = 4, 'Ease_of_Learning' = 5. Total = 9 (not less than 6).

From the given data, respondents 84 and 62 have a combined score for 'Frequent_Usage' and 'Ease_of_Learning' that is less than 6.

The final answer is: 2",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents from the 'Junior' group rated 'Frequent_Usage' as 4 and 'Ease_of_Learning' as 4?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to analyze the 'responses' section of the provided dataset and identify respondents who belong to the 'Junior' group, rated 'Frequent_Usage' as 4, and rated 'Ease_of_Learning' as 4.

According to the 'questions' schema, the 'Group' question is a multiple-choice question with options A. Senior, B. Junior, C. Middle, D. Intern. Therefore, respondents who belong to the 'Junior' group will have answered 'B' to the 'Group' question.

Upon examining the 'responses' section, we find one respondent who matches the specified criteria:

- Respondent id ""23"" answered 'B' to the 'Group' question (indicating they are from the 'Junior' group), rated 'Frequent_Usage' as 4, and rated 'Ease_of_Learning' as 4.

Therefore, the number of respondents from the 'Junior' group who rated 'Frequent_Usage' as 4 and 'Ease_of_Learning' as 4 is 1.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

</task>","To determine how many respondents rated 'Frequent_Usage' and 'Integration_of_Functions' with the same score, we need to examine each respondent's answers for these two questions and count the instances where the scores match.

1. Respondent 71: 'Frequent_Usage' = 3, 'Integration_of_Functions' = 4. Scores do not match.
2. Respondent 10: 'Frequent_Usage' = 5, 'Integration_of_Functions' = 5. Scores match.
3. Respondent 45: 'Frequent_Usage' = 5, 'Integration_of_Functions' = 5. Scores match.
4. Respondent 77: 'Frequent_Usage' = 5, 'Integration_of_Functions' = 4. Scores do not match.
5. Respondent 78: 'Frequent_Usage' = 1, 'Integration_of_Functions' = 4. Scores do not match.
6. Respondent 37: 'Frequent_Usage' = 4, 'Integration_of_Functions' = 5. Scores do not match.
7. Respondent 12: 'Frequent_Usage' = 3, 'Integration_of_Functions' = 5. Scores do not match.
8. Respondent 66: 'Frequent_Usage' = 4, 'Integration_of_Functions' = 5. Scores do not match.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose combined score for 'Frequent_Usage' and 'Need_for_Technical_Support' is less than 6.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to iterate through each respondent's answers in the 'responses' section and check their scores for 'Frequent_Usage' and 'Need_for_Technical_Support'. We then sum these scores and check if the total is less than 6. If it is, we count this respondent.

Given the provided data:

- Respondent 70: 'Frequent_Usage' = 5, 'Need_for_Technical_Support' = 1, Total = 6
- Respondent 38: 'Frequent_Usage' = 3, 'Need_for_Technical_Support' = 3, Total = 6
- Respondent 79: 'Frequent_Usage' = 5, 'Need_for_Technical_Support' = 2, Total = 7
- Respondent 4: 'Frequent_Usage' = 4, 'Need_for_Technical_Support' = 1, Total = 5
- Respondent 80: 'Frequent_Usage' = 5, 'Need_for_Technical_Support' = 3, Total = 8

Only Respondent 4 has a combined score less than 6.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

How many respondents rated 'Frequent_Usage' and 'System_Complexity' with the same score?
</task>","To determine how many respondents rated 'Frequent_Usage' and 'System_Complexity' with the same score, we need to examine each respondent's answers for these two questions and count the instances where the scores match.

1. Respondent 2: 'Frequent_Usage' = 4, 'System_Complexity' = 1. Scores do not match.
2. Respondent 61: 'Frequent_Usage' = 1, 'System_Complexity' = 5. Scores do not match.
3. Respondent 15: 'Frequent_Usage' = 2, 'System_Complexity' = 2. Scores match.
4. Respondent 51: 'Frequent_Usage' = 4, 'System_Complexity' = 1. Scores do not match.
5. Respondent 19: 'Frequent_Usage' = 1, 'System_Complexity' = 1. Scores match.
6. Respondent 88: 'Frequent_Usage' = 2, 'System_Complexity' = 2. Scores match.
7. Respondent 6: 'Frequent_Usage' = 5, 'System_Complexity' = 1. Scores do not match.
8. Respondent 18: 'Frequent_Usage' = 3, 'System_Complexity' = 1. Scores do not match.
9. Respondent 69: 'Frequent_Usage' = 3, 'System_Complexity' = 4. Scores do not match.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose combined score for 'System_Complexity' and 'Ease_of_Use' is less than 6.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to iterate through each respondent's answers in the 'responses' section and check their scores for 'System_Complexity' and 'Ease_of_Use'. We then sum these scores and check if the total is less than 6. If it is, we count this respondent.

Let's examine the data:

1. Respondent 10: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 4, Total = 5 (less than 6)
2. Respondent 28: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5, Total = 6 (not less than 6)
3. Respondent 19: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5, Total = 6 (not less than 6)
4. Respondent 39: System_Complexity = 4, Ease_of_Use = 1, Total = 5 (less than 6)
5. Respondent 90: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5, Total = 6 (not less than 6)
6. Respondent 31: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 2, Total = 3 (less than 6)
7. Respondent 64: System_Complexity = 3, Ease_of_Use = 2, Total = 5 (less than 6)
8. Respondent 4: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5, Total = 6 (not less than 6)
9. Respondent 5: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5, Total = 6 (not less than 6)

Counting the respondents with a combined score less than 6: Respondents 10, 39, 31, and 64 meet this criterion.

The final answer is: 4",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose combined score for 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' and 'Frequent_Usage' is less than 3.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to iterate through each respondent's answers in the 'responses' section and check their scores for 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' and 'Frequent_Usage'. We then sum these scores and check if the total is less than 3. If it is, we count this respondent.

Let's examine the data:

1. Respondent 74: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 1, 'Frequent_Usage' = 5. Total = 6.
2. Respondent 22: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 2, 'Frequent_Usage' = 1. Total = 3.
3. Respondent 81: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 2, 'Frequent_Usage' = 1. Total = 3.
4. Respondent 30: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 1, 'Frequent_Usage' = 3. Total = 4.
5. Respondent 36: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 1, 'Frequent_Usage' = 1. Total = 2.
6. Respondent 62: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 1, 'Frequent_Usage' = 1. Total = 2.
7. Respondent 84: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 1, 'Frequent_Usage' = 3. Total = 4.
8. Respondent 69: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 1, 'Frequent_Usage' = 3. Total = 4.

From the totals calculated, respondents 36 and 62 have a combined score less than 3.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
How many respondents from the 'Middle' group rated 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' as 4 and 'Frequent_Usage' as 1?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to analyze the 'responses' section of the provided data and identify respondents who belong to the 'Middle' group, rated 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' as 4, and 'Frequent_Usage' as 1.

From the 'questions' schema, we understand that the 'Group' question is a multiple-choice question with options A. Senior, B. Junior, C. Middle, D. Intern. Therefore, respondents from the 'Middle' group would have answered ""C"" to the 'Group' question.

We then look through the 'responses' to find respondents who match all the given criteria:

1. Answered ""C"" to the 'Group' question (indicating they are from the 'Middle' group).
2. Rated 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' as 4.
3. Rated 'Frequent_Usage' as 1.

After examining the responses:

- Respondent 50 belongs to the 'Middle' group but does not match the criteria for 'Frequent_Usage' (rated 1) and 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' (rated 1).
- Respondent 9 belongs to the 'Middle' group, rated 'Frequent_Usage' as 2 (not 1), and 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' as 4, so does not fully match.
- Respondent 4 belongs to the 'Middle' group, rated 'Frequent_Usage' as 4 (not 1), and 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' as 1, so does not match.
- Respondent 40 belongs to the 'Middle' group, rated 'Frequent_Usage' as 5 (not 1), and 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' as 1, so does not match.

However, upon closer inspection, there isn't a respondent who exactly matches the criteria of being in the 'Middle' group, rating 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' as 4, and 'Frequent_Usage' as 1. 

The final answer is: 0",True
case_35,conceptual_aggregation,Count the respondents whose combined score for 'Ease_of_Use' and 'Frequent_Usage' is less than 8.,"<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose combined score for 'Ease_of_Use' and 'Frequent_Usage' is less than 8.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to iterate through each respondent's answers in the 'responses' section and check their scores for 'Ease_of_Use' and 'Frequent_Usage'. We then sum these two scores for each respondent and count how many of these sums are less than 8.

Let's examine the data:

1. Respondent 71: Ease_of_Use = 5, Frequent_Usage = 3, Sum = 8
2. Respondent 43: Ease_of_Use = 5, Frequent_Usage = 3, Sum = 8
3. Respondent 17: Ease_of_Use = 5, Frequent_Usage = 5, Sum = 10
4. Respondent 44: Ease_of_Use = 5, Frequent_Usage = 3, Sum = 8
5. Respondent 20: Ease_of_Use = 5, Frequent_Usage = 1, Sum = 6
6. Respondent 37: Ease_of_Use = 5, Frequent_Usage = 4, Sum = 9
7. Respondent 56: Ease_of_Use = 4, Frequent_Usage = 5, Sum = 9
8. Respondent 33: Ease_of_Use = 5, Frequent_Usage = 3, Sum = 8
9. Respondent 73: Ease_of_Use = 4, Frequent_Usage = 1, Sum = 5
10. Respondent 8: Ease_of_Use = 2, Frequent_Usage = 2, Sum = 4
11. Respondent 68: Ease_of_Use = 4, Frequent_Usage = 4, Sum = 8
12. Respondent 36: Ease_of_Use = 5, Frequent_Usage = 1, Sum = 6

Now, let's count the respondents whose combined score for 'Ease_of_Use' and 'Frequent_Usage' is less than 8:

- Respondent 20: Sum = 6
- Respondent 73: Sum = 5
- Respondent 8: Sum = 4
- Respondent 36: Sum = 6

There are 4 respondents whose combined score is less than 8.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents from the 'Junior' group rated 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' as 3 and 'Inconsistency' as 4?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to analyze the 'responses' section of the provided data and identify respondents who belong to the 'Junior' group, rated 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' as 3, and 'Inconsistency' as 4.

According to the 'questions' schema, the 'Group' question has options A. Senior, B. Junior, C. Middle, D. Intern. Therefore, respondents who belong to the 'Junior' group will have 'B' as their answer for the 'Group' question.

Upon examining the 'responses' section, we find the following respondents who match the specified criteria:

- Respondent id ""3"" has 'B' for 'Group' (indicating 'Junior'), '2' for 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' (does not match), and '4' for 'Inconsistency' (matches). However, this respondent does not match the 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' criterion.
- Respondent id ""23"" has 'B' for 'Group' (indicating 'Junior'), '3' for 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' (matches), and '2' for 'Inconsistency' (does not match). However, this respondent does not match the 'Inconsistency' criterion.

There are no respondents who exactly match both criteria of being in the 'Junior' group, rating 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' as 3, and 'Inconsistency' as 4.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents rated 'Frequent_Usage' and 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' with the same score?
</task>","To solve this task, we need to iterate through each respondent's answers and compare the scores for 'Frequent_Usage' and 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use'. We then count how many respondents have the same score for both questions.

After analyzing the data:

- Respondent 88: 'Frequent_Usage' = 2, 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 1 (different scores)
- Respondent 78: 'Frequent_Usage' = 1, 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 5 (different scores)
- Respondent 12: 'Frequent_Usage' = 3, 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 2 (different scores)

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose combined score for 'Need_for_Technical_Support' and 'Inconsistency' is less than 2.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to iterate through each respondent's answers in the 'responses' section and check their scores for 'Need_for_Technical_Support' and 'Inconsistency'. We then sum these scores and check if the total is less than 2.

Let's examine the data:

1. Respondent 82: 'Need_for_Technical_Support' = 1, 'Inconsistency' = 1. Total = 2.
2. Respondent 54: 'Need_for_Technical_Support' = 3, 'Inconsistency' = 1. Total = 4.
3. Respondent 55: 'Need_for_Technical_Support' = 1, 'Inconsistency' = 1. Total = 2.
4. Respondent 14: 'Need_for_Technical_Support' = 1, 'Inconsistency' = 1. Total = 2.
5. Respondent 9: 'Need_for_Technical_Support' = 5, 'Inconsistency' = 5. Total = 10.
6. Respondent 47: 'Need_for_Technical_Support' = 1, 'Inconsistency' = 1. Total = 2.
7. Respondent 90: 'Need_for_Technical_Support' = 2, 'Inconsistency' = 2. Total = 4.
8. Respondent 60: 'Need_for_Technical_Support' = 1, 'Inconsistency' = 2. Total = 3.
9. Respondent 48: 'Need_for_Technical_Support' = 1, 'Inconsistency' = 1. Total = 2.
10. Respondent 6: 'Need_for_Technical_Support' = 1, 'Inconsistency' = 1. Total = 2.
11. Respondent 78: 'Need_for_Technical_Support' = 4, 'Inconsistency' = 4. Total = 8.

None of the respondents have a combined score for 'Need_for_Technical_Support' and 'Inconsistency' that is less than 2. 

The final answer is: 0",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents rated 'System_Complexity' and 'Ease_of_Use' with the same score?
</task>","To determine how many respondents rated 'System_Complexity' and 'Ease_of_Use' with the same score, we need to examine each respondent's answers for these two questions and count the instances where the scores match.

From the provided data:

1. Respondent 27: 'System_Complexity' = 4, 'Ease_of_Use' = 2 (scores do not match)
2. Respondent 34: 'System_Complexity' = 4, 'Ease_of_Use' = 5 (scores do not match)
3. Respondent 50: 'System_Complexity' = 1, 'Ease_of_Use' = 5 (scores do not match)
4. Respondent 4: 'System_Complexity' = 1, 'Ease_of_Use' = 5 (scores do not match)
5. Respondent 25: 'System_Complexity' = 3, 'Ease_of_Use' = 3 (scores match)
6. Respondent 29: 'System_Complexity' = 1, 'Ease_of_Use' = 4 (scores do not match)
7. Respondent 51: 'System_Complexity' = 1, 'Ease_of_Use' = 5 (scores do not match)
8. Respondent 73: 'System_Complexity' = 1, 'Ease_of_Use' = 4 (scores do not match)
9. Respondent 1: 'System_Complexity' = 1, 'Ease_of_Use' = 5 (scores do not match)

Only Respondent 25 has the same score for 'System_Complexity' and 'Ease_of_Use'.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who are in a group where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'System_Complexity' and 'Ease_of_Use' scores for each group, and then compare these averages to determine which groups have a higher average 'System_Complexity' score. Finally, we count the respondents in those groups.

From the provided data, we can calculate the averages as follows:

1. **Group A (Senior)**:
   - 'System_Complexity': 2 (from respondent 89)
   - 'Ease_of_Use': 3 (from respondent 89)
   Since there's only one respondent in this group, these are both the sum and the average.

2. **Group B (Junior)**:
   - 'System_Complexity': 1 (from respondent 36)
   - 'Ease_of_Use': 5 (from respondent 36)
   Again, only one respondent.

3. **Group C (Middle)**:
   - 'System_Complexity': 1 (from 43) + 2 (from 22) + 1 (from 50) + 1 (from 37) = 5
   - 'Ease_of_Use': 5 (from 43) + 4 (from 22) + 5 (from 50) + 5 (from 37) = 19
   - Average 'System_Complexity': 5 / 4 = 1.25
   - Average 'Ease_of_Use': 19 / 4 = 4.75

4. **Group D (Intern)**:
   - 'System_Complexity': 5 (from 49) + 1 (from 30) + 1 (from 74) + 1 (from 71) = 8
   - 'Ease_of_Use': 5 (from 49) + 5 (from 30) + 5 (from 74) + 5 (from 71) = 20
   - Average 'System_Complexity': 8 / 4 = 2
   - Average 'Ease_of_Use': 20 / 4 = 5

Comparing the averages:
- Group A: 'System_Complexity' (2) < 'Ease_of_Use' (3)
- Group B: 'System_Complexity' (1) < 'Ease_of_Use' (5)
- Group C: 'System_Complexity' (1.25) < 'Ease_of_Use' (4.75)
- Group D: 'System_Complexity' (2) < 'Ease_of_Use' (5)

None of the groups have a higher average 'System_Complexity' score than their average 'Ease_of_Use' score. Therefore, there are no respondents in groups where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score.

The final answer is: $\boxed{0}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
How many respondents in the 'Junior' group have a 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score that is higher than the average 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' for the 'Intern' group?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score for the 'Intern' group. Then, we will identify the respondents in the 'Junior' group and count how many of them have a 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score higher than this average.

1. **Calculate the average 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score for the 'Intern' group:**

   Respondents in the 'Intern' group are those with `<answer question=""Group"">D</answer>`. Their 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' scores are as follows:
   - Respondent 15: 2
   - Respondent 29: 1
   - Respondent 18: 1
   - Respondent 12: 2

   The sum of these scores is 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 6. There are 4 respondents, so the average 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score for the 'Intern' group is 6 / 4 = 1.5.

2. **Identify respondents in the 'Junior' group and count those with a 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score higher than 1.5:**

   Respondents in the 'Junior' group are those with `<answer question=""Group"">B</answer>`. Their 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' scores are as follows:
   - Respondent 36: 1
   - Respondent 32: 1
   - Respondent 14: 3

   Out of these, only Respondent 14 has a 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score (3) higher than the average for the 'Intern' group (1.5).

Therefore, there is **1** respondent in the 'Junior' group with a 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score higher than the average for the 'Intern' group.",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents in the 'Intern' group have a 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score that is higher than the average 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' for the 'Senior' group?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score for the 'Senior' group and then find out how many respondents in the 'Intern' group have a score higher than this average.

1. **Identify 'Senior' group respondents and their 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' scores:**
   - Respondent 86: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 2
   - Respondent 13: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 1
   - Respondent 59: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 1

2. **Calculate the average 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score for the 'Senior' group:**
   - Average = (2 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 4 / 3 = 1.33

3. **Identify 'Intern' group respondents and their 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' scores:**
   - Respondent 90: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 1
   - Respondent 60: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 2
   - Respondent 48: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 1
   - Respondent 77: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 1
   - Respondent 64: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 5
   - Respondent 78: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 5

4. **Count 'Intern' group respondents with 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score higher than the 'Senior' group average (1.33):**
   - Respondent 60: 2 (higher than 1.33)
   - Respondent 64: 5 (higher than 1.33)
   - Respondent 78: 5 (higher than 1.33)

Therefore, there are **3** respondents in the 'Intern' group with a 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score higher than the average for the 'Senior' group.",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who are in a group where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'System_Complexity' and 'Ease_of_Use' scores for each group, and then compare these averages to determine which groups have a higher average 'System_Complexity' score. Finally, we count the respondents in those groups.

From the provided data:

1. **Group A (Senior)**: 
   - Respondent 67
     - System_Complexity: 1
     - Ease_of_Use: 5

2. **Group B (Junior)**: 
   - Respondent 23
     - System_Complexity: 1
     - Ease_of_Use: 4

3. **Group C (Middle)**: 
   - Respondents 53, 70
     - System_Complexity: 1 (both)
     - Ease_of_Use: 5 (both)

4. **Group D (Intern)**: 
   - Respondents 90, 15, 49, 29
     - System_Complexity: 1, 2, 5, 1
     - Ease_of_Use: 5, 4, 5, 4

Calculating averages for each group:

1. **Group A**:
   - Average System_Complexity: 1
   - Average Ease_of_Use: 5
   - System_Complexity > Ease_of_Use: No

2. **Group B**:
   - Average System_Complexity: 1
   - Average Ease_of_Use: 4
   - System_Complexity > Ease_of_Use: No

3. **Group C**:
   - Average System_Complexity: 1
   - Average Ease_of_Use: 5
   - System_Complexity > Ease_of_Use: No

4. **Group D**:
   - Average System_Complexity: (1 + 2 + 5 + 1) / 4 = 9 / 4 = 2.25
   - Average Ease_of_Use: (5 + 4 + 5 + 4) / 4 = 18 / 4 = 4.5
   - System_Complexity > Ease_of_Use: No

Upon reviewing the calculations, it appears there was an oversight in the comparison for Group D. Given the correct averages:

- Group D's average System_Complexity is 2.25
- Group D's average Ease_of_Use is 4.5

It's clear that the average 'System_Complexity' score is not higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score in any group. Therefore, the count of respondents in groups where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score is 0.

The final answer is: $\boxed{0}$",True

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
How many respondents have a total positive usability score ('Ease_of_Use' + 'Integration_of_Functions') that is lower than the average for all respondents not in their group?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average total positive usability score for each group, and then compare each respondent's score to the average of the other groups.

1. **Calculate Total Positive Usability Score for Each Respondent:**
   - This score is the sum of 'Ease_of_Use' and 'Integration_of_Functions' for each respondent.

2. **Calculate Average Total Positive Usability Score for Each Group:**
   - Group A: [(1+1) + (5+5)] / 2 = 6
   - Group B: [(5+2) + (5+2)] / 2 = 7
   - Group C: [(5+5) + (5+5) + (5+4) + (5+5) + (1+4)] / 5 = 9.4
   - Group D: [(4+5)] / 1 = 9

3. **Identify Respondents with Scores Lower than the Average of Other Groups:**
   - For each respondent, calculate their total positive usability score and compare it to the average score of the groups they are not a part of.

Let's calculate and compare:

- Respondent 35 (Group A): Score = 1+1 = 2. Average of other groups (B, C, D) = (7 + 9.4 + 9) / 3 = 8.47. 2 < 8.47.
- Respondent 11 (Group A): Score = 5+5 = 10. Average of other groups (B, C, D) = (7 + 9.4 + 9) / 3 = 8.47. 10 > 8.47.
- Respondent 54 (Group C): Score = 5+5 = 10. Average of other groups (A, B, D) = (6 + 7 + 9) / 3 = 7.33. 10 > 7.33.
- Respondent 63 (Group C): Score = 5+5 = 10. Average of other groups (A, B, D) = (6 + 7 + 9) / 3 = 7.33. 10 > 7.33.
- Respondent 33 (Group C): Score = 5+5 = 10. Average of other groups (A, B, D) = (6 + 7 + 9) / 3 = 7.33. 10 > 7.33.
- Respondent 39 (Group C): Score = 1+5 = 6. Average of other groups (A, B, D) = (6 + 7 + 9) / 3 = 7.33. 6 < 7.33.
- Respondent 44 (Group B): Score = 5+2 = 7. Average of other groups (A, C, D) = (6 + 9.4 + 9) / 3 = 8.13. 7 < 8.13.
- Respondent 3 (Group B): Score = 3+2 = 5. Average of other groups (A, C, D) = (6 + 9.4 + 9) / 3 = 8.13. 5 < 8.13.
- Respondent 10 (Group D): Score = 4+5 = 9. Average of other groups (A, B, C) = (6 + 7 + 9.4) / 3 = 7.47. 9 > 7.47.
- Respondent 62 (Group C): Score = 5+4 = 9. Average of other groups (A, B, D) = (6 + 7 + 9) / 3 = 7.33. 9 > 7.33.

**Respondents with scores lower than the average of their non-group members:**
- Respondent 35
- Respondent 39
- Respondent 44
- Respondent 3

**Count of such respondents:** 4

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$",True
case_46,conceptual_aggregation,Count the respondents who are in a group where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score.,"<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who are in a group where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'System_Complexity' and 'Ease_of_Use' scores for each group, and then compare these averages to determine which groups have a higher average 'System_Complexity' score. Finally, we count the respondents in those groups.

From the provided data:

1. **Group A**:
   - System_Complexity scores: 1, 1, 1, 1, 1
   - Ease_of_Use scores: 4, 4, 5, 5, 5
   - Average System_Complexity: (1+1+1+1+1)/5 = 1
   - Average Ease_of_Use: (4+4+5+5+5)/5 = 4.6

2. **Group C**:
   - System_Complexity scores: 1, 1
   - Ease_of_Use scores: 4, 5
   - Average System_Complexity: (1+1)/2 = 1
   - Average Ease_of_Use: (4+5)/2 = 4.5

3. **Group D**:
   - System_Complexity scores: 1, 1
   - Ease_of_Use scores: 4, 5
   - Average System_Complexity: (1+1)/2 = 1
   - Average Ease_of_Use: (4+5)/2 = 4.5

In none of the groups is the average 'System_Complexity' score higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score. Therefore, there are no respondents in groups where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score.

The final answer is: $\boxed{0}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who are in a group where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'System_Complexity' and 'Ease_of_Use' scores for each group, and then compare these averages to determine which groups have a higher average 'System_Complexity' score. Finally, we count the respondents in those groups.

From the provided data, we can calculate the averages as follows:

1. **Group A**:
   - 'System_Complexity': (1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1) / 5 = 6 / 5 = 1.2
   - 'Ease_of_Use': (1 + 4 + 5 + 5 + 5) / 5 = 20 / 5 = 4
   - Since 1.2 < 4, the average 'System_Complexity' score is not higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score for Group A.

2. **Group B**:
   - 'System_Complexity': (2 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 4 / 3 = 1.3333
   - 'Ease_of_Use': (5 + 5 + 5) / 3 = 15 / 3 = 5
   - Since 1.3333 < 5, the average 'System_Complexity' score is not higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score for Group B.

3. **Group C**:
   - 'System_Complexity': (3 + 1 + 1 + 1) / 4 = 6 / 4 = 1.5
   - 'Ease_of_Use': (1 + 5 + 5 + 5) / 4 = 16 / 4 = 4
   - Since 1.5 < 4, the average 'System_Complexity' score is not higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score for Group C.

4. **Group D**:
   - 'System_Complexity': (1 + 1) / 2 = 2 / 2 = 1
   - 'Ease_of_Use': (5 + 5) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5
   - Since 1 < 5, the average 'System_Complexity' score is not higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score for Group D.

Given the calculations above, there are no groups where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score. Therefore, the count of respondents in such groups is 0.

The final answer is: $\boxed{0}$",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who are in a group where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'System_Complexity' and 'Ease_of_Use' scores for each group, and then compare these averages to determine which groups have a higher average 'System_Complexity' score. Finally, we count the respondents in those groups.

From the provided data:

1. **Group A (Senior)**:
   - System_Complexity scores: 1 (from respondent 72), 1 (from respondent 65)
   - Ease_of_Use scores: 5 (from respondent 72), 5 (from respondent 65)
   - Average System_Complexity: (1 + 1) / 2 = 1
   - Average Ease_of_Use: (5 + 5) / 2 = 5
   - Since 1 < 5, this group does not meet the criteria.

2. **Group B (Junior)**:
   - System_Complexity scores: 4 (from respondent 69)
   - Ease_of_Use scores: 5 (from respondent 69)
   - Average System_Complexity: 4
   - Average Ease_of_Use: 5
   - Since 4 < 5, this group does not meet the criteria.

3. **Group C (Middle)**:
   - System_Complexity scores: 1 (from respondent 17), 4 (from respondent 39)
   - Ease_of_Use scores: 5 (from respondent 17), 1 (from respondent 39)
   - Average System_Complexity: (1 + 4) / 2 = 2.5
   - Average Ease_of_Use: (5 + 1) / 2 = 3
   - Since 2.5 < 3, this group does not meet the criteria.

4. **Group D (Intern)**:
   - System_Complexity scores: 1 (from respondent 71), 1 (from respondent 41), 3 (from respondent 25)
   - Ease_of_Use scores: 5 (from respondent 71), 5 (from respondent 41), 3 (from respondent 25)
   - Average System_Complexity: (1 + 1 + 3) / 3 = 1.6667
   - Average Ease_of_Use: (5 + 5 + 3) / 3 = 4.3333
   - Since 1.6667 < 4.3333, this group does not meet the criteria.

However, upon reviewing the calculations, it appears there was an oversight in the comparison for Group C. Let's correct that and properly assess each group based on the task's requirement:

- For Group C, with an average System_Complexity of 2.5 and an average Ease_of_Use of 3, the condition is not met because 2.5 < 3.
- Upon reevaluation, none of the groups have an average 'System_Complexity' score higher than their average 'Ease_of_Use' score based on the provided calculations.

Given the corrected understanding and calculations, the actual task is to count respondents in groups where the average 'System_Complexity' exceeds the average 'Ease_of_Use'. Since none of the groups meet this criterion based on the calculations provided, the count of such respondents is 0. 

The final answer is: $\boxed{0}$",True

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who are in a group where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'System_Complexity' and 'Ease_of_Use' scores for each group, and then compare these averages to determine which groups have a higher average 'System_Complexity' score. Finally, we count the respondents in those groups.

From the provided data, we can calculate the averages as follows:

1. **Group A**:
   - 'System_Complexity': (1 + 1) / 2 = 1
   - 'Ease_of_Use': (5 + 4) / 2 = 4.5
   - Since 1 < 4.5, Group A does not have a higher 'System_Complexity' score.

2. **Group B**:
   - 'System_Complexity': (1 + 1) / 2 = 1
   - 'Ease_of_Use': (5 + 5) / 2 = 5
   - Since 1 < 5, Group B does not have a higher 'System_Complexity' score.

3. **Group C**:
   - 'System_Complexity': (3 + 1 + 2) / 3 = 2
   - 'Ease_of_Use': (1 + 5 + 5) / 3 = 3.67
   - Since 2 < 3.67, Group C does not have a higher 'System_Complexity' score.

4. **Group D**:
   - 'System_Complexity': (1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1) / 5 = 1.2
   - 'Ease_of_Use': (4 + 4 + 5 + 5 + 5) / 5 = 4.6
   - Since 1.2 < 4.6, Group D does not have a higher 'System_Complexity' score.

Given the calculations above, none of the groups have an average 'System_Complexity' score higher than their average 'Ease_of_Use' score. Therefore, the count of respondents in such groups is 0. 

The final answer is: $\boxed{0}$",True
case_50,conceptual_aggregation,How many respondents have a total positive usability score ('Ease_of_Use' + 'Integration_of_Functions') that is lower than the average for all respondents not in their group?,"<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
How many respondents have a total positive usability score ('Ease_of_Use' + 'Integration_of_Functions') that is lower than the average for all respondents not in their group?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average total positive usability score for each group, and then compare each respondent's score to the average of the other groups.

1. **Calculate Total Positive Usability Score for Each Respondent:**
   - This score is the sum of 'Ease_of_Use' and 'Integration_of_Functions' for each respondent.

2. **Calculate Average Total Positive Usability Score for Each Group:**
   - Group A (Senior): Calculate the average of the total positive usability scores for all respondents in Group A.
   - Group B (Junior): Calculate the average for Group B.
   - Group C (Middle): Calculate the average for Group C.
   - Group D (Intern): Calculate the average for Group D.

3. **Compare Each Respondent's Score to the Average of the Other Groups:**
   - For each respondent, calculate the average total positive usability score of all groups except their own.
   - Compare this average to the respondent's total positive usability score.

Let's calculate:

### Step 1: Calculate Total Positive Usability Score for Each Respondent

| Respondent ID | Group | Ease_of_Use | Integration_of_Functions | Total Positive Usability Score |
|---------------|-------|-------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------|
| 64            | D     | 2           | 2                        | 4                             |
| 35            | A     | 1           | 1                        | 2                             |
| 47            | B     | 4           | 5                        | 9                             |
| 82            | C     | 4           | 4                        | 8                             |
| 32            | B     | 5           | 5                        | 10                            |
| 89            | A     | 3           | 5                        | 8                             |
| 61            | B     | 2           | 1                        | 3                             |
| 43            | C     | 5           | 5                        | 10                            |
| 11            | A     | 5           | 5                        | 10                            |

### Step 2: Calculate Average Total Positive Usability Score for Each Group

- **Group A (Senior):** (2 + 8 + 10) / 3 = 20 / 3 = 6.67
- **Group B (Junior):** (9 + 10 + 3) / 3 = 22 / 3 = 7.33
- **Group C (Middle):** (8 + 10) / 2 = 18 / 2 = 9
- **Group D (Intern):** 4 (only one respondent)

### Step 3: Compare Each Respondent's Score to the Average of the Other Groups

- **Respondent 64 (Group D):** Average of other groups = (6.67 + 7.33 + 9) / 3 = 23 / 3 = 7.67. Since 4 < 7.67, this respondent meets the condition.
- **Respondent 35 (Group A):** Average of other groups = (7.33 + 9 + 4) / 3 = 20.33 / 3 = 6.78. Since 2 < 6.78, this respondent meets the condition.
- **Respondent 47 (Group B):** Average of other groups = (6.67 + 9 + 4) / 3 = 19.67 / 3 = 6.56. Since 9 > 6.56, this respondent does not meet the condition.
- **Respondent 82 (Group C):** Average of other groups = (6.67 + 7.33 + 4) / 3 = 18 / 3 = 6. Since 8 > 6, this respondent does not meet the condition.
- **Respondent 32 (Group B):** Average of other groups = (6.67 + 9 + 4) / 3 = 19.67 / 3 = 6.56. Since 10 > 6.56, this respondent does not meet the condition.
- **Respondent 89 (Group A):** Average of other groups = (7.33 + 9 + 4) / 3 = 20.33 / 3 = 6.78. Since 8 > 6.78, this respondent does not meet the condition.
- **Respondent 61 (Group B):** Average of other groups = (6.67 + 9 + 4) / 3 = 19.67 / 3 = 6.56. Since 3 < 6.56, this respondent meets the condition.
- **Respondent 43 (Group C):** Average of other groups = (6.67 + 7.33 + 4) / 3 = 18 / 3 = 6. Since 10 > 6, this respondent does not meet the condition.
- **Respondent 11 (Group A):** Average of other groups = (7.33 + 9 + 4) / 3 = 20.33 / 3 = 6.78. Since 10 > 6.78, this respondent does not meet the condition.

### Respondents Meeting the Condition

- Respondent 64
- Respondent 35
- Respondent 61

There are **3** respondents whose total positive usability score is lower than the average for all respondents not in their group.",True
