<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
How many respondents from the 'Intern' rated 'Ease_of_Learning' as 3?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to analyze the 'responses' section of the data and find the respondents who belong to the 'Intern' group and rated 'Ease_of_Learning' as 3.

From the 'questions' schema, we know that the 'Intern' group corresponds to the answer code 'D'. 

Looking at the 'responses' section, we can see that there are several respondents who belong to the 'Intern' group (i.e., their answer to the 'Group' question is 'D'). However, only one of them rated 'Ease_of_Learning' as 3.

The respondent with ID ""31"" is an 'Intern' and rated 'Ease_of_Learning' as 3.

Therefore, the answer to the question is: 1",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents are in the 'Middle' group?
</task>","To determine the number of respondents in the 'Middle' group, we need to look at the 'Group' field in the 'responses' section and find the responses where the 'Group' is 'C', since according to the 'questions' schema, 'C' corresponds to 'Middle'.

From the provided data:

- Respondent ""33"" has ""Group"": ""C"", which corresponds to 'Middle'.
- No other respondents have ""Group"": ""C"".

Therefore, there is 1 respondent in the 'Middle' group. 

The final answer is: 1",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents from the 'Intern' rated 'Confidence_in_Use' as 5?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to analyze the 'responses' section of the given data and identify the respondents who belong to the 'Intern' group and have rated 'Confidence_in_Use' as 5.

From the 'questions' schema, we understand that the 'Group' field is a multiple-choice question with options A. Senior, B. Junior, C. Middle, and D. Intern. We are interested in respondents who belong to the 'Intern' group, which corresponds to option D.

We then examine each response:

1. Respondent ""42"" belongs to group ""A"", which is ""Senior"", not ""Intern"".
2. Respondent ""20"" belongs to group ""C"", which is ""Middle"", not ""Intern"".
3. Respondent ""51"" belongs to group ""C"", which is ""Middle"", not ""Intern"".
4. Respondent ""84"" belongs to group ""D"", which is ""Intern"". Their rating for 'Confidence_in_Use' is 5.
5. Respondent ""7"" belongs to group ""D"", which is ""Intern"". Their rating for 'Confidence_in_Use' is 5.

Therefore, there are 2 respondents from the 'Intern' group who rated 'Confidence_in_Use' as 5.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
How many respondents are in the 'Intern' group?
</task>","To determine the number of respondents in the 'Intern' group, we need to look at the ""Group"" field in each response and count how many times the answer is ""D"", since according to the schema, ""D"" corresponds to ""Intern"".

From the provided data:

- Respondent ""30"" is in group ""D"".
- Respondent ""48"" is in group ""D"".
- Respondent ""49"" is in group ""D"".
- Respondent ""25"" is in group ""D"".

Respondents ""17"" and ""6"" are not in group ""D"" (""17"" is in group ""C"" and ""6"" is in group ""A"").

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents from the 'Senior' rated 'Integration_of_Functions' as 3?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to analyze the 'responses' section of the data and find the respondents who belong to the 'Senior' group and rated 'Integration_of_Functions' as 3.

From the 'questions' schema, we know that the 'Group' field is an MCQ with options A. Senior, B. Junior, C. Middle, and D. Intern. We are interested in respondents who belong to the 'Senior' group, which corresponds to option A.

Looking at the 'responses' section, we can see that there are several respondents who belong to the 'Senior' group (i.e., their 'Group' answer is A). We need to check the 'Integration_of_Functions' rating for each of these respondents.

Respondent 58 has 'Group' = A and 'Integration_of_Functions' = 3.
Respondent 72 has 'Group' = A and 'Integration_of_Functions' = 5.
Respondent 76 has 'Group' = A and 'Integration_of_Functions' = 4.

Only respondent 58 meets the criteria.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents are in the 'Junior' group?
</task>","To determine the number of respondents in the 'Junior' group, we first need to identify the code associated with 'Junior' in the schema. According to the ""questions"" section, the ""Group"" field is defined as ""[MCQ: A. Senior B. Junior C. Middle D. Intern]"". This means 'Junior' is associated with the code ""B"".

Next, we examine the ""responses"" section to find all instances where the ""Group"" answer is ""B"" (ignoring case, so ""b"" would also be considered). 

From the provided data:
- Respondent ""61"" has ""Group"": ""B"".
- Respondent ""68"" has ""Group"": ""B"".

There are no other respondents with ""Group"": ""B"" in the provided data.

Therefore, the number of respondents in the 'Junior' group is 2.",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who rated 'Ease_of_Use' as 4.
</task>","To answer this question, I will analyze the 'responses' section of the provided data and count the number of respondents who rated 'Ease_of_Use' as 4.

From the 'questions' section, I understand that 'Ease_of_Use' is a Likert scale question with scores ranging from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree).

After analyzing the 'responses' section, I found the following respondents who rated 'Ease_of_Use' as 4:

* Respondent ""2"" with answer ""4""
* Respondent ""5"" with answer ""5"" (does not match the criteria)
* Respondent ""67"" with answer ""5"" (does not match the criteria)
* Respondent ""88"" with answer ""5"" (does not match the criteria)
* Respondent ""2"" is the only one with answer ""4""

However, I also found another respondent with answer ""4"" for 'Ease_of_Use':

* Respondent ""2"" with answer ""4""

So, the total count of respondents who rated 'Ease_of_Use' as 4 is 1, but I also found another respondent ""2"" is not the only one, I made a mistake, there is no other respondent with answer ""4"", but I found that respondent ""2"" has answer ""4"" and also respondent ""67"" and ""5"" and ""88"" has answer ""5"", so I will recheck the answers.

Respondent ""2"" has answer ""4"", 
Respondent ""67"" has answer ""5"", 
Respondent ""5"" has answer ""5"", 
Respondent ""21"" has answer ""1"", 
Respondent ""31"" has answer ""2"", 
Respondent ""3"" has answer ""3"", 
Respondent ""8"" has answer ""2"", 
Respondent ""88"" has answer ""5"".

Only respondent ""2"" has answer ""4"" for 'Ease_of_Use', but I will recheck all the answers.

Respondent ""27"" has answer ""2"", 
Respondent ""2"" has answer ""4"", 
Respondent ""67"" has answer ""5"", 
Respondent ""5"" has answer ""5"", 
Respondent ""21"" has answer ""1"", 
Respondent ""31"" has answer ""2"", 
Respondent ""3"" has answer ""3"", 
Respondent ""8"" has answer ""2"", 
Respondent ""88"" has answer ""5"".

I found that only one respondent has answer ""4"" for 'Ease_of_Use', and the answer is from respondent ""2"".

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents from the 'Junior' rated 'Integration_of_Functions' as 4?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to analyze the 'responses' section of the data and find the respondents who belong to the 'Junior' group and rated 'Integration_of_Functions' as 4.

From the 'questions' schema, we know that the 'Group' field is a MCQ with options A. Senior, B. Junior, C. Middle, D. Intern. So, we are looking for respondents with 'Group' = 'B'.

After analyzing the 'responses' section, we found that there is one respondent with 'Group' = 'B' and 'Integration_of_Functions' = '4':

Respondent 26 has 'Group' = 'B' and 'Integration_of_Functions' = '4'.

Therefore, the answer is: 1",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents are in the 'Senior' group?
</task>","To determine the number of respondents in the 'Senior' group, we need to look at the ""Group"" field in each response and count how many times the answer is ""A"", since according to the schema, ""A"" corresponds to ""Senior"".

From the provided data:

- Respondent ""34"" answered ""A"" for the ""Group"" field.
- Respondent ""13"" answered ""A"" for the ""Group"" field.
- Respondent ""42"" answered ""A"" for the ""Group"" field.

Therefore, there are 3 respondents in the 'Senior' group.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents are in the 'Middle' group?
</task>","To determine the number of respondents in the 'Middle' group, we first need to identify the code associated with 'Middle' in the schema. According to the ""questions"" section, the ""Group"" field is defined as ""[MCQ: A. Senior B. Junior C. Middle D. Intern]"". This means 'Middle' is associated with the code ""C"".

Next, we examine the ""responses"" section to find all instances where the ""Group"" answer is ""C"". 

From the provided data:
- Respondent ""22"" has ""Group"": ""C"".
- Respondent ""54"" has ""Group"": ""C"".
- Respondent ""82"" has ""Group"": ""C"".
- Respondent ""37"" has ""Group"": ""C"".

There are 4 respondents with ""Group"": ""C"", which corresponds to the 'Middle' group.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents are in the 'Intern' group?
</task>","To determine the number of respondents in the 'Intern' group, we need to look at the ""Group"" field in each response and count how many times the value ""D"" appears, since according to the schema, ""D"" corresponds to ""Intern"".

From the provided data:

- Respondent ""18"" is in group ""D"".
- Respondent ""90"" is in group ""D"".
- Respondent ""84"" is in group ""D"".
- Respondent ""45"" is in group ""D"".
- Respondent ""30"" is in group ""D"".

Therefore, there are 5 respondents in the 'Intern' group.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose combined score for 'Frequent_Usage' and 'Ease_of_Learning' is less than 6.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to iterate through each respondent's answers in the 'responses' section and check their scores for 'Frequent_Usage' and 'Ease_of_Learning'. We then sum these scores and check if the total is less than 6. If it is, we count this respondent.

Given data:

- Respondent 84: 'Frequent_Usage' = 3, 'Ease_of_Learning' = 2. Total = 5.
- Respondent 62: 'Frequent_Usage' = 1, 'Ease_of_Learning' = 1. Total = 2.
- Respondent 90: 'Frequent_Usage' = 5, 'Ease_of_Learning' = 5. Total = 10.
- Respondent 36: 'Frequent_Usage' = 1, 'Ease_of_Learning' = 5. Total = 6.
- Respondent 37: 'Frequent_Usage' = 4, 'Ease_of_Learning' = 5. Total = 9.

From the given data, the respondents with a combined score for 'Frequent_Usage' and 'Ease_of_Learning' less than 6 are:

- Respondent 84 (Total = 5)
- Respondent 62 (Total = 2)

Therefore, the number of respondents whose combined score for 'Frequent_Usage' and 'Ease_of_Learning' is less than 6 is 2.",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents from the 'Junior' group rated 'Frequent_Usage' as 4 and 'Ease_of_Learning' as 4?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to analyze the 'responses' section of the data and find the respondents who belong to the 'Junior' group, rated 'Frequent_Usage' as 4, and 'Ease_of_Learning' as 4.

From the 'questions' schema, we know that the 'Group' field is a MCQ with options A. Senior, B. Junior, C. Middle, D. Intern. So, we are looking for respondents with 'Group' = 'B'.

After analyzing the 'responses' section, we find that respondent ""23"" belongs to the 'Junior' group (since 'Group' = 'B'), but their 'Frequent_Usage' is rated as 4 and 'Ease_of_Learning' is also rated as 4.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
How many respondents rated 'Frequent_Usage' and 'Integration_of_Functions' with the same score?
</task>","To determine how many respondents rated 'Frequent_Usage' and 'Integration_of_Functions' with the same score, we need to examine each response and compare these two specific ratings.

From the provided data, let's list out the respondents who rated 'Frequent_Usage' and 'Integration_of_Functions' with the same score:

1. Respondent ""71"" - 'Frequent_Usage': 3, 'Integration_of_Functions': 4 (Different scores)
2. Respondent ""10"" - 'Frequent_Usage': 5, 'Integration_of_Functions': 5 (Same score)
3. Respondent ""45"" - 'Frequent_Usage': 5, 'Integration_of_Functions': 5 (Same score)
4. Respondent ""77"" - 'Frequent_Usage': 5, 'Integration_of_Functions': 4 (Different scores)
5. Respondent ""78"" - 'Frequent_Usage': 1, 'Integration_of_Functions': 4 (Different scores)
6. Respondent ""37"" - 'Frequent_Usage': 4, 'Integration_of_Functions': 5 (Different scores)
7. Respondent ""12"" - 'Frequent_Usage': 3, 'Integration_of_Functions': 5 (Different scores)
8. Respondent ""66"" - 'Frequent_Usage': 4, 'Integration_of_Functions': 5 (Different scores)
9. Respondent ""51"" - 'Frequent_Usage': 4, 'Integration_of_Functions': 5 (Different scores)
10. Respondent ""54"" - 'Frequent_Usage': 4, 'Integration_of_Functions': 5 (Different scores)
11. Respondent ""3"" - 'Frequent_Usage': 2, 'Integration_of_Functions': 2 (Same score)

Based on the comparison, the respondents who rated 'Frequent_Usage' and 'Integration_of_Functions' with the same score are:

- Respondent ""10""
- Respondent ""45""
- Respondent ""3""

Therefore, there are 3 respondents who rated 'Frequent_Usage' and 'Integration_of_Functions' with the same score.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose combined score for 'Frequent_Usage' and 'Need_for_Technical_Support' is less than 6.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to iterate through each respondent's answers in the 'responses' section and calculate the combined score for 'Frequent_Usage' and 'Need_for_Technical_Support'. We then count how many respondents have a combined score less than 6.

Given data:

1. Respondent ""70"": 'Frequent_Usage' = 5, 'Need_for_Technical_Support' = 1. Combined score = 6.
2. Respondent ""38"": 'Frequent_Usage' = 3, 'Need_for_Technical_Support' = 3. Combined score = 6.
3. Respondent ""79"": 'Frequent_Usage' = 5, 'Need_for_Technical_Support' = 2. Combined score = 7.
4. Respondent ""4"": 'Frequent_Usage' = 4, 'Need_for_Technical_Support' = 1. Combined score = 5.
5. Respondent ""80"": 'Frequent_Usage' = 5, 'Need_for_Technical_Support' = 3. Combined score = 8.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose combined score for 'System_Complexity' and 'Ease_of_Use' is less than 6.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to iterate through each respondent's answers in the 'responses' section and check their scores for 'System_Complexity' and 'Ease_of_Use'. We then combine these scores and check if the sum is less than 6. If it is, we count that respondent.

Let's examine the data:

1. Respondent 10: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 4, Sum = 5 (less than 6)
2. Respondent 28: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5, Sum = 6 (not less than 6)
3. Respondent 19: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5, Sum = 6 (not less than 6)
4. Respondent 39: System_Complexity = 4, Ease_of_Use = 1, Sum = 5 (less than 6)
5. Respondent 90: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5, Sum = 6 (not less than 6)
6. Respondent 31: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 2, Sum = 3 (less than 6)
7. Respondent 64: System_Complexity = 3, Ease_of_Use = 2, Sum = 5 (less than 6)
8. Respondent 4: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5, Sum = 6 (not less than 6)
9. Respondent 5: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5, Sum = 6 (not less than 6)

Counting the respondents whose combined score for 'System_Complexity' and 'Ease_of_Use' is less than 6 gives us: 10, 39, 31, 64.

There are 4 respondents whose combined score is less than 6.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose combined score for 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' and 'Frequent_Usage' is less than 3.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to iterate through each respondent's answers in the 'responses' section and check the combined score for 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' and 'Frequent_Usage'. We then count how many respondents have a combined score less than 3.

Let's examine the data:

1. Respondent ""74"": 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 1, 'Frequent_Usage' = 5. Combined score = 6.
2. Respondent ""22"": 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 2, 'Frequent_Usage' = 1. Combined score = 3.
3. Respondent ""81"": 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 2, 'Frequent_Usage' = 1. Combined score = 3.
4. Respondent ""30"": 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 1, 'Frequent_Usage' = 3. Combined score = 4.
5. Respondent ""36"": 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 1, 'Frequent_Usage' = 1. Combined score = 2.
6. Respondent ""62"": 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 1, 'Frequent_Usage' = 1. Combined score = 2.
7. Respondent ""84"": 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 1, 'Frequent_Usage' = 3. Combined score = 4.
8. Respondent ""69"": 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 1, 'Frequent_Usage' = 3. Combined score = 4.

From the data, we can see that respondents ""36"" and ""62"" have a combined score less than 3.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
How many respondents from the 'Middle' group rated 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' as 4 and 'Frequent_Usage' as 1?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to analyze the 'responses' section of the data and find the respondents who belong to the 'Middle' group, rated 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' as 4, and 'Frequent_Usage' as 1.

From the 'questions' schema, we know that the 'Group' field is a MCQ with options A. Senior, B. Junior, C. Middle, D. Intern. So, we are looking for respondents with 'Group' = 'C'.

After analyzing the 'responses' section, we found the following respondents who match the criteria:

* Respondent 9: 'Group' = 'C', 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = '4', 'Frequent_Usage' = '2' (does not match)
* Respondent 4: 'Group' = 'C', 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = '1', 'Frequent_Usage' = '4' (does not match)
* Respondent 50: 'Group' = 'C', 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = '1', 'Frequent_Usage' = '1' (does not match)
* Respondent 40: 'Group' = 'C', 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = '1', 'Frequent_Usage' = '5' (does not match)

Only one respondent (9) has 'Group' = 'C' and 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = '4', but 'Frequent_Usage' is '2', not '1'. 

However, there is no respondent who has 'Group' = 'C', 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = '4', and 'Frequent_Usage' = '1'.


The final answer is: 0",True
case_35,conceptual_aggregation,Count the respondents whose combined score for 'Ease_of_Use' and 'Frequent_Usage' is less than 8.,"{

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose combined score for 'Ease_of_Use' and 'Frequent_Usage' is less than 8.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to iterate through each respondent's answers in the 'responses' section and check their scores for 'Ease_of_Use' and 'Frequent_Usage'. We then sum these two scores for each respondent and count how many of these sums are less than 8.

Let's calculate the combined score for 'Ease_of_Use' and 'Frequent_Usage' for each respondent and count those with a score less than 8:

1. Respondent 71: Ease_of_Use = 5, Frequent_Usage = 3, Total = 8
2. Respondent 43: Ease_of_Use = 5, Frequent_Usage = 3, Total = 8
3. Respondent 17: Ease_of_Use = 5, Frequent_Usage = 5, Total = 10
4. Respondent 44: Ease_of_Use = 5, Frequent_Usage = 3, Total = 8
5. Respondent 20: Ease_of_Use = 5, Frequent_Usage = 1, Total = 6
6. Respondent 37: Ease_of_Use = 5, Frequent_Usage = 4, Total = 9
7. Respondent 56: Ease_of_Use = 4, Frequent_Usage = 5, Total = 9
8. Respondent 33: Ease_of_Use = 5, Frequent_Usage = 3, Total = 8
9. Respondent 73: Ease_of_Use = 4, Frequent_Usage = 1, Total = 5
10. Respondent 8: Ease_of_Use = 2, Frequent_Usage = 2, Total = 4
11. Respondent 68: Ease_of_Use = 4, Frequent_Usage = 4, Total = 8
12. Respondent 36: Ease_of_Use = 5, Frequent_Usage = 1, Total = 6

Respondents with a combined score less than 8 are:
- Respondent 20 (Total = 6)
- Respondent 73 (Total = 5)
- Respondent 8 (Total = 4)
- Respondent 36 (Total = 6)

Count of respondents with a combined score less than 8: 4

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents from the 'Junior' group rated 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' as 3 and 'Inconsistency' as 4?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to analyze the 'responses' section of the data and find the respondents who belong to the 'Junior' group, rated 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' as 3, and 'Inconsistency' as 4.

From the 'questions' schema, we know that the 'Group' field is a MCQ with options A. Senior, B. Junior, C. Middle, D. Intern. So, we are looking for respondents with 'Group' = 'B'.

After analyzing the data, we find that there is one respondent who meets the criteria:

- Respondent ""3"" has 'Group' = 'B' (Junior), 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = '2' (does not meet the criteria)
- Respondent ""8"" has 'Group' = 'B' (Junior), 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = '2' (does not meet the criteria)
- Respondent ""23"" has 'Group' = 'B' (Junior), 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = '3', and 'Inconsistency' = '2' (does not meet the criteria)
- Respondent ""32"" has 'Group' = 'B' (Junior), 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = '1' (does not meet the criteria)

However, none of the respondents from the 'Junior' group rated 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' as 3 and 'Inconsistency' as 4, except for none. But respondent ""3"" has 'Inconsistency' = '4' and 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = '2'. 

Respondent ""23"" has 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = '3' but 'Inconsistency' = '2'.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
How many respondents rated 'Frequent_Usage' and 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' with the same score?
</task>","To solve this task, we need to iterate through each respondent's answers in the 'responses' section and compare the scores for 'Frequent_Usage' and 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use'. We then count how many respondents have the same score for both questions.

Let's examine the data:

1. Respondent 88: 'Frequent_Usage' = 2, 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 1 (Different scores)
2. Respondent 78: 'Frequent_Usage' = 1, 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 5 (Different scores)
3. Respondent 12: 'Frequent_Usage' = 3, 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 2 (Different scores)
4. Respondent 80: 'Frequent_Usage' = 5, 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 4 (Different scores)
5. Respondent 86: 'Frequent_Usage' = 4, 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 2 (Different scores)
6. Respondent 82: 'Frequent_Usage' = 1, 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 5 (Different scores)
7. Respondent 66: 'Frequent_Usage' = 4, 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 2 (Different scores)
8. Respondent 5: 'Frequent_Usage' = 5, 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 1 (Different scores)
9. Respondent 81: 'Frequent_Usage' = 1, 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 2 (Different scores)
10. Respondent 48: 'Frequent_Usage' = 5, 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 1 (Different scores)

After comparing the scores for each respondent, we find that none of the respondents rated 'Frequent_Usage' and 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' with the same score.

The final answer is: 0",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose combined score for 'Need_for_Technical_Support' and 'Inconsistency' is less than 2.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to iterate through each respondent's answers in the 'responses' section and check their scores for 'Need_for_Technical_Support' and 'Inconsistency'. We then sum these scores and check if the total is less than 2. If it is, we count this respondent.

Let's examine the data:

1. Respondent 82: 'Need_for_Technical_Support' = 1, 'Inconsistency' = 1. Total = 2. Not less than 2.
2. Respondent 54: 'Need_for_Technical_Support' = 3, 'Inconsistency' = 1. Total = 4. Not less than 2.
3. Respondent 55: 'Need_for_Technical_Support' = 1, 'Inconsistency' = 1. Total = 2. Not less than 2.
4. Respondent 14: 'Need_for_Technical_Support' = 1, 'Inconsistency' = 1. Total = 2. Not less than 2.
5. Respondent 9: 'Need_for_Technical_Support' = 5, 'Inconsistency' = 5. Total = 10. Not less than 2.
6. Respondent 47: 'Need_for_Technical_Support' = 1, 'Inconsistency' = 1. Total = 2. Not less than 2.
7. Respondent 90: 'Need_for_Technical_Support' = 2, 'Inconsistency' = 2. Total = 4. Not less than 2.
8. Respondent 60: 'Need_for_Technical_Support' = 1, 'Inconsistency' = 2. Total = 3. Not less than 2.
9. Respondent 48: 'Need_for_Technical_Support' = 1, 'Inconsistency' = 1. Total = 2. Not less than 2.
10. Respondent 6: 'Need_for_Technical_Support' = 1, 'Inconsistency' = 1. Total = 2. Not less than 2.
11. Respondent 78: 'Need_for_Technical_Support' = 4, 'Inconsistency' = 4. Total = 8. Not less than 2.

Upon reviewing the data, there are no respondents whose combined score for 'Need_for_Technical_Support' and 'Inconsistency' is less than 2.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

How many respondents rated 'System_Complexity' and 'Ease_of_Use' with the same score?
</task>","To determine how many respondents rated 'System_Complexity' and 'Ease_of_Use' with the same score, we need to examine each response and compare the scores for these two questions.

1. Respondent 27: System_Complexity = 4, Ease_of_Use = 2 (Different scores)
2. Respondent 34: System_Complexity = 4, Ease_of_Use = 5 (Different scores)
3. Respondent 50: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5 (Different scores)

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the respondents who are in a group where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'System_Complexity' and 'Ease_of_Use' scores for each group, and then compare these averages to determine which groups have a higher average 'System_Complexity' score. Finally, we count the respondents in those groups.

Given the data:

1. Identify the groups and their respective 'System_Complexity' and 'Ease_of_Use' scores.
2. Calculate the average 'System_Complexity' and 'Ease_of_Use' scores for each group.
3. Determine which groups have an average 'System_Complexity' score higher than their average 'Ease_of_Use' score.
4. Count the respondents in those groups.

Let's execute the steps:

### Step 1: Identify Groups and Scores

- Group A (Senior): 
  - Respondent 89: System_Complexity = 2, Ease_of_Use = 3
- Group B (Junior): 
  - Respondent 36: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
- Group C (Middle): 
  - Respondent 43: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
  - Respondent 22: System_Complexity = 2, Ease_of_Use = 4
  - Respondent 50: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
  - Respondent 37: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
- Group D (Intern): 
  - Respondent 49: System_Complexity = 5, Ease_of_Use = 5
  - Respondent 30: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
  - Respondent 74: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
  - Respondent 71: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5

### Step 2: Calculate Average Scores for Each Group

- Group A (Senior): 
  - Average System_Complexity = 2
  - Average Ease_of_Use = 3
- Group B (Junior): 
  - Average System_Complexity = 1
  - Average Ease_of_Use = 5
- Group C (Middle): 
  - Average System_Complexity = (1 + 2 + 1 + 1) / 4 = 5 / 4 = 1.25
  - Average Ease_of_Use = (5 + 4 + 5 + 5) / 4 = 19 / 4 = 4.75
- Group D (Intern): 
  - Average System_Complexity = (5 + 1 + 1 + 1) / 4 = 8 / 4 = 2
  - Average Ease_of_Use = (5 + 5 + 5 + 5) / 4 = 20 / 4 = 5

### Step 3: Determine Groups with Higher Average 'System_Complexity'

Comparing the averages:
- Group A: System_Complexity (2) < Ease_of_Use (3)
- Group B: System_Complexity (1) < Ease_of_Use (5)
- Group C: System_Complexity (1.25) < Ease_of_Use (4.75)
- Group D: System_Complexity (2) < Ease_of_Use (5)

None of the groups have a higher average 'System_Complexity' score than their average 'Ease_of_Use' score.

### Step 4: Count Respondents in Those Groups

Since no group meets the criteria of having a higher average 'System_Complexity' score than their average 'Ease_of_Use' score, there are no respondents to count.

The final answer is: $\boxed{0}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
How many respondents in the 'Junior' group have a 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score that is higher than the average 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' for the 'Intern' group?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score for the 'Intern' group. Then, we will identify the respondents in the 'Junior' group and count how many of them have a 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score higher than this average.

1. **Identify 'Intern' group respondents and their 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' scores:**
   - From the 'responses' section, we find respondents with ""Group"" = ""D"" (since 'Intern' corresponds to D).
   - The 'Intern' respondents are: 15, 29, 18, 12.
   - Their 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' scores are: 2, 1, 1, 2 respectively.

2. **Calculate the average 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score for the 'Intern' group:**
   - Sum of scores = 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 6
   - Number of respondents = 4
   - Average = Sum of scores / Number of respondents = 6 / 4 = 1.5

3. **Identify 'Junior' group respondents and their 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' scores:**
   - From the 'responses' section, we find respondents with ""Group"" = ""B"" (since 'Junior' corresponds to B).
   - The 'Junior' respondents are: 36, 32, 14.
   - Their 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' scores are: 1, 1, 3 respectively.

4. **Count 'Junior' group respondents with 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score higher than the 'Intern' group average (1.5):**
   - Respondent 14 has a score of 3, which is higher than 1.5.
   - Respondents 36 and 32 have scores of 1, which is not higher than 1.5.

Therefore, there is **1** respondent in the 'Junior' group with a 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score higher than the average for the 'Intern' group.",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
How many respondents in the 'Intern' group have a 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score that is higher than the average 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' for the 'Senior' group?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score for the 'Senior' group and then find out how many respondents in the 'Intern' group have a score higher than this average.

1. **Identify 'Senior' group respondents and their 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' scores:**
   - Respondent 86: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 2
   - Respondent 13: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 1
   - Respondent 59: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 1

2. **Calculate the average 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score for the 'Senior' group:**
   - Average = (2 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 4 / 3 = 1.33

3. **Identify 'Intern' group respondents and their 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' scores:**
   - Respondent 90: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 1
   - Respondent 60: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 2
   - Respondent 48: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 1
   - Respondent 77: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 1
   - Respondent 64: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 5
   - Respondent 78: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 5

4. **Count 'Intern' group respondents with 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score higher than the 'Senior' group average (1.33):**
   - Respondent 60: 2 > 1.33
   - Respondent 64: 5 > 1.33
   - Respondent 78: 5 > 1.33

Therefore, there are 3 respondents in the 'Intern' group with a 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score higher than the average for the 'Senior' group.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$",True
case_44,conceptual_aggregation,Count the respondents who are in a group where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score.,"{

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who are in a group where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'System_Complexity' and 'Ease_of_Use' scores for each group, and then compare these averages to determine which groups have a higher average 'System_Complexity' score. Finally, we count the respondents in those groups.

Given the data:

1. Group A (Senior):
   - Respondent 67: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5

2. Group B (Junior):
   - Respondent 23: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 4

3. Group C (Middle):
   - Respondent 53: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
   - Respondent 70: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5

4. Group D (Intern):
   - Respondent 15: System_Complexity = 2, Ease_of_Use = 4
   - Respondent 29: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 4
   - Respondent 49: System_Complexity = 5, Ease_of_Use = 5
   - Respondent 90: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5

Calculating averages for each group:

1. Group A: 
   - Average System_Complexity = 1
   - Average Ease_of_Use = 5
   Since 1 < 5, this group does not meet the criteria.

2. Group B: 
   - Average System_Complexity = 1
   - Average Ease_of_Use = 4
   Since 1 < 4, this group does not meet the criteria.

3. Group C: 
   - Average System_Complexity = (1 + 1) / 2 = 1
   - Average Ease_of_Use = (5 + 5) / 2 = 5
   Since 1 < 5, this group does not meet the criteria.

4. Group D: 
   - Average System_Complexity = (2 + 1 + 5 + 1) / 4 = 9 / 4 = 2.25
   - Average Ease_of_Use = (4 + 4 + 5 + 5) / 4 = 18 / 4 = 4.5
   Since 2.25 < 4.5, this group does not meet the criteria upon reevaluation.

Upon reviewing the calculations, it appears there was an oversight in the comparison for Group D. Given the correct calculations:

- Group D's average System_Complexity is indeed 2.25, and its average Ease_of_Use is 4.5. Since 2.25 < 4.5, Group D does not meet the criteria.

Actually, upon a detailed review, none of the groups have an average 'System_Complexity' score higher than their average 'Ease_of_Use' score based on the provided data. 

Therefore, the count of respondents in groups where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score is 0.",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
How many respondents have a total positive usability score ('Ease_of_Use' + 'Integration_of_Functions') that is lower than the average for all respondents not in their group?
</task>","To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the average total positive usability score for each group, and then compare each respondent's score to the average of the other groups.

1. Calculate the total positive usability score for each respondent: 'Ease_of_Use' + 'Integration_of_Functions'.
2. Calculate the average total positive usability score for each group.
3. For each respondent, calculate the average total positive usability score of the other groups (not their own).
4. Compare each respondent's score to the average of the other groups and count those with a lower score.

Let's start by calculating the total positive usability score for each respondent:

- Respondent 35: 1 (Ease_of_Use) + 1 (Integration_of_Functions) = 2
- Respondent 54: 5 + 5 = 10
- Respondent 63: 5 + 5 = 10
- Respondent 33: 5 + 5 = 10
- Respondent 11: 5 + 5 = 10
- Respondent 39: 1 + 5 = 6
- Respondent 44: 5 + 2 = 7
- Respondent 3: 3 + 2 = 5
- Respondent 10: 4 + 5 = 9
- Respondent 62: 5 + 4 = 9

Next, we group the respondents by their 'Group' and calculate the average total positive usability score for each group:

- Group A: (2 + 10) / 2 = 6
- Group B: (7 + 5) / 2 = 6
- Group C: (10 + 10 + 10 + 6 + 9) / 5 = 9
- Group D: 9 / 1 = 9

Now, for each respondent, we calculate the average total positive usability score of the other groups:

- Respondent 35 (Group A): (6 + 9 + 9) / 3 = 8
- Respondent 54 (Group C): (6 + 6 + 9) / 3 = 7
- Respondent 63 (Group C): (6 + 6 + 9) / 3 = 7
- Respondent 33 (Group C): (6 + 6 + 9) / 3 = 7
- Respondent 11 (Group A): (6 + 9 + 9) / 3 = 8
- Respondent 39 (Group C): (6 + 6 + 9) / 3 = 7
- Respondent 44 (Group B): (6 + 9 + 9) / 3 = 8
- Respondent 3 (Group B): (6 + 9 + 9) / 3 = 8
- Respondent 10 (Group D): (6 + 6 + 9) / 3 = 7
- Respondent 62 (Group C): (6 + 6 + 9) / 3 = 7

Finally, we compare each respondent's score to the average of the other groups and count those with a lower score:

- Respondent 35: 2 < 8 (Yes)
- Respondent 54: 10 > 7 (No)
- Respondent 63: 10 > 7 (No)
- Respondent 33: 10 > 7 (No)
- Respondent 11: 10 > 8 (No)
- Respondent 39: 6 < 7 (Yes)
- Respondent 44: 7 < 8 (Yes)
- Respondent 3: 5 < 8 (Yes)
- Respondent 10: 9 > 7 (No)
- Respondent 62: 9 > 7 (No)

Count of respondents with a lower score than the average of the other groups: 4

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$",True
case_46,conceptual_aggregation,Count the respondents who are in a group where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score.,"{

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the respondents who are in a group where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'System_Complexity' and 'Ease_of_Use' scores for each group, and then compare these averages to determine which groups have a higher average 'System_Complexity' score. Finally, we count the respondents in those groups.

Given the data:

1. **Group A**: 
   - System_Complexity scores: 1, 1, 1, 1, 1
   - Ease_of_Use scores: 4, 4, 5, 5, 5
   - Average System_Complexity: (1+1+1+1+1)/5 = 1
   - Average Ease_of_Use: (4+4+5+5+5)/5 = 4.6

2. **Group C**: 
   - System_Complexity scores: 1, 1
   - Ease_of_Use scores: 4, 5
   - Average System_Complexity: (1+1)/2 = 1
   - Average Ease_of_Use: (4+5)/2 = 4.5

3. **Group D**: 
   - System_Complexity scores: 1, 1
   - Ease_of_Use scores: 4, 5
   - Average System_Complexity: (1+1)/2 = 1
   - Average Ease_of_Use: (4+5)/2 = 4.5

Comparing the averages:
- For Group A, the average 'System_Complexity' (1) is less than the average 'Ease_of_Use' (4.6).
- For Group C, the average 'System_Complexity' (1) is less than the average 'Ease_of_Use' (4.5).
- For Group D, the average 'System_Complexity' (1) is less than the average 'Ease_of_Use' (4.5).

Since none of the groups have an average 'System_Complexity' score higher than their average 'Ease_of_Use' score, there are no respondents to count in this context.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the respondents who are in a group where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'System_Complexity' and 'Ease_of_Use' scores for each group, and then compare these averages to determine which groups have a higher average 'System_Complexity' score. Finally, we count the respondents in those groups.

Given the data:

1. Identify the groups and their respective 'System_Complexity' and 'Ease_of_Use' scores.
2. Calculate the average 'System_Complexity' and 'Ease_of_Use' scores for each group.
3. Determine which groups have an average 'System_Complexity' score higher than their average 'Ease_of_Use' score.
4. Count the respondents in those groups.

Let's execute these steps:

### Step 1: Identify Groups and Scores

From the 'responses' section, we can list the groups and their scores as follows:

- Group A: 
  - Respondent 46: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 1
  - Respondent 56: System_Complexity = 2, Ease_of_Use = 4
  - Respondent 59: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
- Group B: 
  - Respondent 44: System_Complexity = 2, Ease_of_Use = 5
  - Respondent 66: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
  - Respondent 79: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
- Group C: 
  - Respondent 9: System_Complexity = 3, Ease_of_Use = 1
  - Respondent 33: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
  - Respondent 50: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
  - Respondent 51: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
- Group D: 
  - Respondent 71: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
  - Respondent 74: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5

### Step 2: Calculate Average Scores

- Group A:
  - Average System_Complexity = (1 + 2 + 1) / 3 = 4 / 3 = 1.33
  - Average Ease_of_Use = (1 + 4 + 5) / 3 = 10 / 3 = 3.33
- Group B:
  - Average System_Complexity = (2 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 4 / 3 = 1.33
  - Average Ease_of_Use = (5 + 5 + 5) / 3 = 15 / 3 = 5
- Group C:
  - Average System_Complexity = (3 + 1 + 1 + 1) / 4 = 6 / 4 = 1.5
  - Average Ease_of_Use = (1 + 5 + 5 + 5) / 4 = 16 / 4 = 4
- Group D:
  - Average System_Complexity = (1 + 1) / 2 = 2 / 2 = 1
  - Average Ease_of_Use = (5 + 5) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5

### Step 3: Determine Groups with Higher System_Complexity

Comparing the averages:
- Group A: System_Complexity (1.33) < Ease_of_Use (3.33)
- Group B: System_Complexity (1.33) < Ease_of_Use (5)
- Group C: System_Complexity (1.5) < Ease_of_Use (4)
- Group D: System_Complexity (1) < Ease_of_Use (5)

None of the groups have a higher average 'System_Complexity' score than their average 'Ease_of_Use' score.

### Step 4: Count Respondents in Those Groups

Since no group meets the criteria of having an average 'System_Complexity' score higher than their average 'Ease_of_Use' score, there are no respondents to count.

The final answer is: $\boxed{0}$",True
case_48,conceptual_aggregation,Count the respondents who are in a group where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score.,"{

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who are in a group where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'System_Complexity' and 'Ease_of_Use' scores for each group, and then compare these averages to determine which groups have a higher average 'System_Complexity' score. Finally, we count the respondents in those groups.

Given the data:

1. Group D (Intern) respondents: 71, 41, 25
   - System_Complexity scores: 1, 1, 3
   - Ease_of_Use scores: 5, 5, 3
   - Average System_Complexity: (1 + 1 + 3) / 3 = 5 / 3 = 1.67
   - Average Ease_of_Use: (5 + 5 + 3) / 3 = 13 / 3 = 4.33

2. Group C (Middle) respondents: 17, 39
   - System_Complexity scores: 1, 4
   - Ease_of_Use scores: 5, 1
   - Average System_Complexity: (1 + 4) / 2 = 5 / 2 = 2.5
   - Average Ease_of_Use: (5 + 1) / 2 = 6 / 2 = 3

3. Group B (Junior) respondent: 69
   - System_Complexity score: 4
   - Ease_of_Use score: 5
   - Average System_Complexity: 4
   - Average Ease_of_Use: 5

4. Group A (Senior) respondents: 72, 65
   - System_Complexity scores: 1, 1
   - Ease_of_Use scores: 5, 5
   - Average System_Complexity: (1 + 1) / 2 = 2 / 2 = 1
   - Average Ease_of_Use: (5 + 5) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5

Comparing the averages:
- Group D: Average System_Complexity (1.67) < Average Ease_of_Use (4.33)
- Group C: Average System_Complexity (2.5) < Average Ease_of_Use (3)
- Group B: Average System_Complexity (4) < Average Ease_of_Use (5)
- Group A: Average System_Complexity (1) < Average Ease_of_Use (5)

None of the groups have a higher average 'System_Complexity' score than their average 'Ease_of_Use' score. Therefore, the count of respondents in groups where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score is 0.",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who are in a group where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'System_Complexity' and 'Ease_of_Use' scores for each group. Then, we compare these averages to determine which groups have a higher average 'System_Complexity' score than 'Ease_of_Use' score. Finally, we count the respondents in those groups.

Given data:

```json
{
  ""questions"": {
    ""Group"": ""Group of the respondent [MCQ: A. Senior B. Junior C. Middle D. Intern]"",
    ""Frequent_Usage"": ""I think that I would like to use this system frequently. [Likert 1–5: 1 = Strongly Disagree, 5 = Strongly Agree]"",
    ""System_Complexity"": ""I found the system unnecessarily complex. [Likert 1–5: 1 = Strongly Disagree, 5 = Strongly Agree]"",
    ""Ease_of_Use"": ""I thought the system was easy to use. [Likert 1–5: 1 = Strongly Disagree, 5 = Strongly Agree]"",
    ...
  },
  ""responses"": [
    {
      ""respondent"": ""9"",
      ""answers"": {
        ""Group"": ""C"",
        ""Frequent_Usage"": ""2"",
        ""System_Complexity"": ""3"",
        ""Ease_of_Use"": ""1"",
        ...
      }
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

Let's calculate the averages for each group:

1. **Group A (Senior)**:
   - System_Complexity: [(1 + 1) / 2] = 1
   - Ease_of_Use: [(5 + 4) / 2] = 4.5
   - Since 1 < 4.5, this group does not meet the criteria.

2. **Group B (Junior)**:
   - System_Complexity: [(1 + 1) / 2] = 1
   - Ease_of_Use: [(5 + 5) / 2] = 5
   - Since 1 < 5, this group does not meet the criteria.

3. **Group C (Middle)**:
   - System_Complexity: [(3 + 1 + 2) / 3] = 2
   - Ease_of_Use: [(1 + 5 + 5) / 3] = 3.6667
   - Since 2 < 3.6667, this group does not meet the criteria.

4. **Group D (Intern)**:
   - System_Complexity: [(1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1) / 5] = 1.2
   - Ease_of_Use: [(4 + 4 + 5 + 5 + 5) / 5] = 4.6
   - Since 1.2 < 4.6, this group does not meet the criteria.

Upon reviewing the calculations, it appears there was an oversight in the initial analysis regarding the comparison and the actual question asked. The task requires counting respondents in groups where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score. Given the calculations above, none of the groups meet this specific criterion as calculated. However, the calculation process itself was aimed to illustrate how one might approach the problem, but it seems there was a misunderstanding in applying the criteria correctly to the provided data.

Given the correct approach and upon reevaluation:
- The actual step should involve directly comparing the averages of 'System_Complexity' and 'Ease_of_Use' for each group and then counting the respondents in the groups where 'System_Complexity' average is indeed higher.

Correcting the approach and outcome based on the task's specific requirement and the calculations provided:
- None of the groups, as per the calculations, have a higher average 'System_Complexity' score than 'Ease_of_Use' score. Thus, the count of respondents in such groups, based on the provided data and calculations, would reflect this assessment.

The final answer is: $\boxed{0}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
How many respondents have a total positive usability score ('Ease_of_Use' + 'Integration_of_Functions') that is lower than the average for all respondents not in their group?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average total positive usability score for each group and then compare each respondent's score to the average of the other groups. The total positive usability score is the sum of 'Ease_of_Use' and 'Integration_of_Functions'.

1. Calculate the total positive usability score for each respondent.
2. Calculate the average total positive usability score for each group (A, B, C, D).
3. For each respondent, calculate the average total positive usability score of the groups they are not in.
4. Compare each respondent's total positive usability score to the average of the other groups.
5. Count how many respondents have a score lower than the average of the other groups.

### Step 1: Calculate Total Positive Usability Score for Each Respondent

| Respondent | Group | Ease_of_Use | Integration_of_Functions | Total Score |
|------------|-------|-------------|--------------------------|-------------|
| 64         | D     | 2           | 2                        | 4           |
| 35         | A     | 1           | 1                        | 2           |
| 47         | B     | 4           | 5                        | 9           |
| 82         | C     | 4           | 4                        | 8           |
| 32         | B     | 5           | 5                        | 10          |
| 89         | A     | 3           | 5                        | 8           |
| 61         | B     | 2           | 1                        | 3           |
| 43         | C     | 5           | 5                        | 10          |
| 11         | A     | 5           | 5                        | 10          |

### Step 2: Calculate Average Total Positive Usability Score for Each Group

- Group A: (2 + 8 + 10) / 3 = 20 / 3 = 6.67
- Group B: (9 + 10 + 3) / 3 = 22 / 3 = 7.33
- Group C: (8 + 10) / 2 = 18 / 2 = 9
- Group D: (4) / 1 = 4

### Step 3 & 4: Calculate Average of Other Groups for Each Respondent and Compare

- Respondent 64 (Group D): Average of A, B, C = (6.67 + 7.33 + 9) / 3 = 23 / 3 = 7.67. Since 4 < 7.67, this respondent qualifies.
- Respondent 35 (Group A): Average of B, C, D = (7.33 + 9 + 4) / 3 = 20.33 / 3 = 6.78. Since 2 < 6.78, this respondent qualifies.
- Respondent 47 (Group B): Average of A, C, D = (6.67 + 9 + 4) / 3 = 19.67 / 3 = 6.56. Since 9 > 6.56, this respondent does not qualify.
- Respondent 82 (Group C): Average of A, B, D = (6.67 + 7.33 + 4) / 3 = 18 / 3 = 6. Since 8 > 6, this respondent does not qualify.
- Respondent 32 (Group B): Average of A, C, D = (6.67 + 9 + 4) / 3 = 19.67 / 3 = 6.56. Since 10 > 6.56, this respondent does not qualify.
- Respondent 89 (Group A): Average of B, C, D = (7.33 + 9 + 4) / 3 = 20.33 / 3 = 6.78. Since 8 > 6.78, this respondent does not qualify.
- Respondent 61 (Group B): Average of A, C, D = (6.67 + 9 + 4) / 3 = 19.67 / 3 = 6.56. Since 3 < 6.56, this respondent qualifies.
- Respondent 43 (Group C): Average of A, B, D = (6.67 + 7.33 + 4) / 3 = 18 / 3 = 6. Since 10 > 6, this respondent does not qualify.
- Respondent 11 (Group A): Average of B, C, D = (7.33 + 9 + 4) / 3 = 20.33 / 3 = 6.78. Since 10 > 6.78, this respondent does not qualify.

### Step 5: Count Respondents with Score Lower Than Average of Other Groups

From the comparisons, respondents 64, 35, and 61 have scores lower than the average of the groups they are not in.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$",True
