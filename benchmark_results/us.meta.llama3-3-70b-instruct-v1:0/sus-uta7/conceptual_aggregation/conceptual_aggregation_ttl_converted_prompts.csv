</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents are in the 'Junior' group?
</task>","To determine the number of respondents in the 'Junior' group, we first need to identify the corresponding code for 'Junior' in the schema. According to the schema, the question about the group of the respondent is coded as follows: ""Group of the respondent [MCQ: A. Senior B. Junior C. Middle D. Intern]"". This means 'Junior' is represented by the code ""B"".

Next, we examine the responses to find all instances where the respondent's group is coded as ""B"". 

From the provided data:
- Respondent61 is in group ""B"".
- Respondent68 is in group ""B"".

There are no other respondents in group ""B"", which corresponds to 'Junior'.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents are in the 'Intern' group?
</task>","To determine the number of respondents in the 'Intern' group, we first need to identify which group 'Intern' corresponds to in the schema. According to the schema, the group options are ""[MCQ: A. Senior B. Junior C. Middle D. Intern]"". This means 'Intern' corresponds to option ""D"".

Next, we examine the responses to find all instances where the group is listed as ""D"", which represents the 'Intern' group.

From the provided data:
- Respondent18 is in group ""D"".
- Respondent90 is in group ""D"".
- Respondent84 is in group ""D"".
- Respondent45 is in group ""D"".
- Respondent30 is in group ""D"".

Therefore, there are 5 respondents in the 'Intern' group.",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose combined score for 'Frequent_Usage' and 'Ease_of_Learning' is less than 6.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to examine each respondent's scores for 'Frequent_Usage' and 'Ease_of_Learning', add these scores together, and then count how many of these combined scores are less than 6.

Let's calculate the combined scores:

1. Respondent84: Frequent_Usage = 3, Ease_of_Learning = 2, Combined = 3 + 2 = 5
2. Respondent62: Frequent_Usage = 1, Ease_of_Learning = 1, Combined = 1 + 1 = 2
3. Respondent90: Frequent_Usage = 5, Ease_of_Learning = 5, Combined = 5 + 5 = 10
4. Respondent36: Frequent_Usage = 1, Ease_of_Learning = 5, Combined = 1 + 5 = 6
5. Respondent37: Frequent_Usage = 4, Ease_of_Learning = 5, Combined = 4 + 5 = 9

Now, let's count the respondents whose combined score is less than 6:

- Respondent84 has a combined score of 5, which is less than 6.
- Respondent62 has a combined score of 2, which is less than 6.
- Respondent36 has a combined score of 6, which is not less than 6.
- Respondent90 and Respondent37 also have scores not less than 6.

Therefore, there are 2 respondents whose combined score for 'Frequent_Usage' and 'Ease_of_Learning' is less than 6.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
How many respondents rated 'Frequent_Usage' and 'Integration_of_Functions' with the same score?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to examine each respondent's answers for 'Frequent_Usage' and 'Integration_of_Functions' and count how many of them have the same score for both.

From the responses:

- Respondent71: Frequent_Usage = 3, Integration_of_Functions = 4 (different scores)
- Respondent10: Frequent_Usage = 5, Integration_of_Functions = 5 (same scores)
- Respondent45: Frequent_Usage = 5, Integration_of_Functions = 5 (same scores)
- Respondent77: Frequent_Usage = 5, Integration_of_Functions = 4 (different scores)
- Respondent78: Frequent_Usage = 1, Integration_of_Functions = 4 (different scores)
- Respondent37: Frequent_Usage = 4, Integration_of_Functions = 5 (different scores)
- Respondent12: Frequent_Usage = 3, Integration_of_Functions = 5 (different scores)
- Respondent66: Frequent_Usage = 4, Integration_of_Functions = 5 (different scores)
- Respondent51: Frequent_Usage = 4, Integration_of_Functions = 5 (different scores)
- Respondent54: Frequent_Usage = 4, Integration_of_Functions = 5 (different scores)
- Respondent3: Frequent_Usage = 2, Integration_of_Functions = 2 (same scores)

Counting the respondents with the same score for 'Frequent_Usage' and 'Integration_of_Functions', we find:

- Respondent10
- Respondent45
- Respondent3

Therefore, there are 3 respondents who rated 'Frequent_Usage' and 'Integration_of_Functions' with the same score.

<task>
Count the respondents whose combined score for 'Frequent_Usage' and 'Need_for_Technical_Support' is less than 6.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to examine each respondent's scores for 'Frequent_Usage' and 'Need_for_Technical_Support', add these scores together, and then count how many of these combined scores are less than 6.

Let's calculate the combined scores:

1. Respondent70: Frequent_Usage = 5, Need_for_Technical_Support = 1, Combined = 5 + 1 = 6
2. Respondent38: Frequent_Usage = 3, Need_for_Technical_Support = 3, Combined = 3 + 3 = 6
3. Respondent79: Frequent_Usage = 5, Need_for_Technical_Support = 2, Combined = 5 + 2 = 7
4. Respondent4: Frequent_Usage = 4, Need_for_Technical_Support = 1, Combined = 4 + 1 = 5
5. Respondent80: Frequent_Usage = 5, Need_for_Technical_Support = 3, Combined = 5 + 3 = 8

Now, let's count the respondents whose combined score is less than 6:

- Respondent4 has a combined score of 5, which is less than 6.

Therefore, there is 1 respondent whose combined score for 'Frequent_Usage' and 'Need_for_Technical_Support' is less than 6.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents rated 'Frequent_Usage' and 'System_Complexity' with the same score?
</task>","To determine how many respondents rated 'Frequent_Usage' and 'System_Complexity' with the same score, we need to examine each respondent's answers for these two questions and count the instances where the scores match.

From the provided data:

   - System_Complexity: ""1""
   - Scores do not match.

2. **Respondent61**:

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose combined score for 'System_Complexity' and 'Ease_of_Use' is less than 6.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to examine each respondent's scores for 'System_Complexity' and 'Ease_of_Use', add these scores together, and then count how many of these combined scores are less than 6.

Let's calculate the combined scores:

1. Respondent10: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 4, Combined = 1 + 4 = 5
2. Respondent28: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5, Combined = 1 + 5 = 6
3. Respondent19: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5, Combined = 1 + 5 = 6
4. Respondent39: System_Complexity = 4, Ease_of_Use = 1, Combined = 4 + 1 = 5
5. Respondent90: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5, Combined = 1 + 5 = 6
6. Respondent31: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 2, Combined = 1 + 2 = 3
7. Respondent64: System_Complexity = 3, Ease_of_Use = 2, Combined = 3 + 2 = 5
8. Respondent4: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5, Combined = 1 + 5 = 6
9. Respondent5: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5, Combined = 1 + 5 = 6

Now, let's count the respondents whose combined score is less than 6:

- Respondent10: 5
- Respondent39: 5
- Respondent31: 3
- Respondent64: 5

There are 4 respondents whose combined score for 'System_Complexity' and 'Ease_of_Use' is less than 6.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose combined score for 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' and 'Frequent_Usage' is less than 3.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to examine each respondent's scores for 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' and 'Frequent_Usage', add these scores together, and then count how many of these combined scores are less than 3.

Let's calculate the combined scores:

1. Respondent74: Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = 1, Frequent_Usage = 5, Combined = 6
2. Respondent22: Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = 2, Frequent_Usage = 1, Combined = 3
3. Respondent81: Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = 2, Frequent_Usage = 1, Combined = 3
4. Respondent30: Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = 1, Frequent_Usage = 3, Combined = 4
5. Respondent36: Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = 1, Frequent_Usage = 1, Combined = 2
6. Respondent62: Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = 1, Frequent_Usage = 1, Combined = 2
7. Respondent84: Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = 1, Frequent_Usage = 3, Combined = 4
8. Respondent69: Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = 1, Frequent_Usage = 3, Combined = 4

Now, let's count the respondents whose combined score is less than 3:
- Respondent36 has a combined score of 2.
- Respondent62 has a combined score of 2.

Therefore, there are 2 respondents whose combined score for 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' and 'Frequent_Usage' is less than 3.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents from the 'Middle' group rated 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' as 4 and 'Frequent_Usage' as 1?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to analyze the 'responses' section and find the respondents who belong to the 'Middle' group, rated 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' as 4, and 'Frequent_Usage' as 1.

According to the 'questions' schema, the 'Group' field is a MCQ with options A. Senior, B. Junior, C. Middle, and D. Intern. So, we are looking for respondents with 'Group' as 'C'.

After analyzing the 'responses' section, we found the following respondents who match the criteria:

* Respondent46 does not match because their 'Group' is 'A' and 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' is 1.
* Respondent9 matches the 'Group' and 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' criteria but their 'Frequent_Usage' is 2, not 1.
* Respondent44 does not match because their 'Frequent_Usage' is 3, not 1.
* Respondent50 does not match because their 'Frequent_Usage' is 1, but their 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' is 1, not 4.

Only Respondent9's 'Group' is 'C' (Middle) and 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' is not 4, but 'Frequent_Usage' is not 1. However, there is no respondent that matches all the criteria.

Therefore, the answer is: 0",True
case_35,conceptual_aggregation,Count the respondents whose combined score for 'Ease_of_Use' and 'Frequent_Usage' is less than 8.,"@prefix : <http://example.org/survey#> .

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose combined score for 'Ease_of_Use' and 'Frequent_Usage' is less than 8.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to examine each respondent's scores for 'Ease_of_Use' and 'Frequent_Usage', add these scores together, and then count how many of these combined scores are less than 8.

From the 'responses' section:

1. Respondent71: Ease_of_Use = 5, Frequent_Usage = 3, Combined = 8
2. Respondent43: Ease_of_Use = 5, Frequent_Usage = 3, Combined = 8
3. Respondent17: Ease_of_Use = 5, Frequent_Usage = 5, Combined = 10
4. Respondent44: Ease_of_Use = 5, Frequent_Usage = 3, Combined = 8
5. Respondent20: Ease_of_Use = 5, Frequent_Usage = 1, Combined = 6
6. Respondent37: Ease_of_Use = 5, Frequent_Usage = 4, Combined = 9
7. Respondent56: Ease_of_Use = 4, Frequent_Usage = 5, Combined = 9
8. Respondent33: Ease_of_Use = 5, Frequent_Usage = 3, Combined = 8
9. Respondent73: Ease_of_Use = 4, Frequent_Usage = 1, Combined = 5
10. Respondent8: Ease_of_Use = 2, Frequent_Usage = 2, Combined = 4
11. Respondent68: Ease_of_Use = 4, Frequent_Usage = 4, Combined = 8
12. Respondent36: Ease_of_Use = 5, Frequent_Usage = 1, Combined = 6

Now, let's count the respondents whose combined score is less than 8:
- Respondent20: Combined = 6
- Respondent73: Combined = 5
- Respondent8: Combined = 4
- Respondent36: Combined = 6

There are 4 respondents whose combined score for 'Ease_of_Use' and 'Frequent_Usage' is less than 8.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
How many respondents rated 'Frequent_Usage' and 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' with the same score?
</task>","To determine the number of respondents who rated 'Frequent_Usage' and 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' with the same score, we need to examine each respondent's answers for these two questions.

1. **Respondent88**: 'Frequent_Usage' = 2, 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 1. (Not the same)
2. **Respondent78**: 'Frequent_Usage' = 1, 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 5. (Not the same)
3. **Respondent12**: 'Frequent_Usage' = 3, 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 2. (Not the same)
4. **Respondent80**: 'Frequent_Usage' = 5, 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 4. (Not the same)
5. **Respondent86**: 'Frequent_Usage' = 4, 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 2. (Not the same)
6. **Respondent82**: 'Frequent_Usage' = 1, 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 5. (Not the same)

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose combined score for 'Need_for_Technical_Support' and 'Inconsistency' is less than 2.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to examine each respondent's scores for 'Need_for_Technical_Support' and 'Inconsistency', add these scores together, and then count how many of these combined scores are less than 2.

From the 'responses' section:

1. **Respondent82**: Need_for_Technical_Support = 1, Inconsistency = 1. Combined score = 2.
2. **Respondent54**: Need_for_Technical_Support = 3, Inconsistency = 1. Combined score = 4.
3. **Respondent55**: Need_for_Technical_Support = 1, Inconsistency = 1. Combined score = 2.
4. **Respondent14**: Need_for_Technical_Support = 1, Inconsistency = 1. Combined score = 2.
5. **Respondent9**: Need_for_Technical_Support = 5, Inconsistency = 5. Combined score = 10.
6. **Respondent47**: Need_for_Technical_Support = 1, Inconsistency = 1. Combined score = 2.
7. **Respondent90**: Need_for_Technical_Support = 2, Inconsistency = 2. Combined score = 4.
8. **Respondent60**: Need_for_Technical_Support = 1, Inconsistency = 2. Combined score = 3.
9. **Respondent48**: Need_for_Technical_Support = 1, Inconsistency = 1. Combined score = 2.
10. **Respondent6**: Need_for_Technical_Support = 1, Inconsistency = 1. Combined score = 2.
11. **Respondent78**: Need_for_Technical_Support = 4, Inconsistency = 4. Combined score = 8.

None of the respondents have a combined score for 'Need_for_Technical_Support' and 'Inconsistency' that is less than 2.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents rated 'System_Complexity' and 'Ease_of_Use' with the same score?
</task>","To determine how many respondents rated 'System_Complexity' and 'Ease_of_Use' with the same score, we need to examine each respondent's answers for these two questions and count the instances where the scores match.

1. **Respondent27**: System_Complexity = ""4"", Ease_of_Use = ""2"". Scores do not match.
2. **Respondent34**: System_Complexity = ""4"", Ease_of_Use = ""5"". Scores do not match.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who are in a group where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'System_Complexity' and 'Ease_of_Use' scores for each group, and then compare these averages to determine which groups have a higher average 'System_Complexity' score. Finally, we count the respondents in those groups.

Given the data:

1. **Group A**: Respondent89
   - System_Complexity: 2
   - Ease_of_Use: 3

2. **Group B**: Respondent36
   - System_Complexity: 1
   - Ease_of_Use: 5

3. **Group C**: Respondents 43, 22, 50, 37
   - System_Complexity: 1, 2, 1, 1
   - Ease_of_Use: 5, 4, 5, 5
   - Average System_Complexity: (1+2+1+1)/4 = 5/4 = 1.25
   - Average Ease_of_Use: (5+4+5+5)/4 = 19/4 = 4.75

4. **Group D**: Respondents 49, 30, 74, 71
   - System_Complexity: 5, 1, 1, 1
   - Ease_of_Use: 5, 5, 5, 5
   - Average System_Complexity: (5+1+1+1)/4 = 8/4 = 2
   - Average Ease_of_Use: (5+5+5+5)/4 = 20/4 = 5

Comparing the averages:
- **Group A**: System_Complexity (2) < Ease_of_Use (3)
- **Group B**: System_Complexity (1) < Ease_of_Use (5)
- **Group C**: System_Complexity (1.25) < Ease_of_Use (4.75)
- **Group D**: System_Complexity (2) < Ease_of_Use (5)

There are no groups where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score. Therefore, the count of respondents in such groups is 0.",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents in the 'Junior' group have a 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score that is higher than the average 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' for the 'Intern' group?
</task>","To answer this question, we first need to calculate the average 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score for the 'Intern' group and then find out how many respondents in the 'Junior' group have a score higher than this average.

From the 'questions' section, we understand that the group is coded as follows: A. Senior, B. Junior, C. Middle, D. Intern.

Looking at the responses, we identify the respondents in the 'Intern' group by their group code ""D"". These are Respondent15, Respondent29, Respondent18, and Respondent12 (though Respondent12's 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score is 2, which is not relevant to this question, but their 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score is relevant).

The 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' scores for the 'Intern' group are:
- Respondent15: 2
- Respondent29: 1
- Respondent18: 1
- Respondent12: 2

Average 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score for the 'Intern' group = (2 + 1 + 1 + 2) / 4 = 6 / 4 = 1.5

Next, we identify the respondents in the 'Junior' group by their group code ""B"". These are Respondent36, Respondent32, Respondent14.

The 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' scores for the 'Junior' group are:
- Respondent36: 1
- Respondent32: 1
- Respondent14: 3

We need to find out how many of these 'Junior' group respondents have a 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score higher than 1.5.

Only Respondent14 has a score (3) higher than the average 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score for the 'Intern' group (1.5).

Therefore, the number of respondents in the 'Junior' group with a 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score higher than the average for the 'Intern' group is 1.",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents in the 'Intern' group have a 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score that is higher than the average 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' for the 'Senior' group?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score for the 'Senior' group and then find out how many respondents in the 'Intern' group have a score higher than this average.

1. **Identify 'Senior' Group Respondents and Their 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' Scores:**
   - Respondent86: Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = ""2""
   - Respondent13: Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = ""1""
   - Respondent59: Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = ""1""

2. **Calculate the Average 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' Score for the 'Senior' Group:**
   - Average = (2 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 4 / 3 = 1.33

3. **Identify 'Intern' Group Respondents and Their 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' Scores:**
   - Respondent90: Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = ""1""
   - Respondent60: Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = ""2""
   - Respondent48: Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = ""1""
   - Respondent77: Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = ""1""
   - Respondent64: Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = ""5""
   - Respondent78: Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = ""5""

4. **Count 'Intern' Group Respondents with 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' Score Higher Than the 'Senior' Group Average (1.33):**
   - Respondent60: 2 > 1.33
   - Respondent64: 5 > 1.33
   - Respondent78: 5 > 1.33

Therefore, there are **3** respondents in the 'Intern' group with a 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score higher than the average for the 'Senior' group.",True
case_44,conceptual_aggregation,Count the respondents who are in a group where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score.,"@prefix : <http://example.org/survey#> .

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who are in a group where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'System_Complexity' and 'Ease_of_Use' scores for each group, and then compare these averages to determine which groups have a higher average 'System_Complexity' score than 'Ease_of_Use' score. Finally, we count the respondents in those groups.

Given the data:

1. **Respondent53**: Group C, System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
2. **Respondent67**: Group A, System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
3. **Respondent70**: Group C, System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
4. **Respondent90**: Group D, System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
5. **Respondent15**: Group D, System_Complexity = 2, Ease_of_Use = 4
6. **Respondent23**: Group B, System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 4
7. **Respondent49**: Group D, System_Complexity = 5, Ease_of_Use = 5
8. **Respondent29**: Group D, System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 4

Let's calculate the averages for each group:

- **Group A**: 
  - System_Complexity: (1) / 1 = 1
  - Ease_of_Use: (5) / 1 = 5
- **Group B**: 
  - System_Complexity: (1) / 1 = 1
  - Ease_of_Use: (4) / 1 = 4
- **Group C**: 
  - System_Complexity: (1 + 1) / 2 = 2 / 2 = 1
  - Ease_of_Use: (5 + 5) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5
- **Group D**: 
  - System_Complexity: (1 + 2 + 5 + 1) / 4 = 9 / 4 = 2.25
  - Ease_of_Use: (5 + 4 + 5 + 4) / 4 = 18 / 4 = 4.5

Comparing the averages:

- **Group A**: System_Complexity (1) < Ease_of_Use (5)
- **Group B**: System_Complexity (1) < Ease_of_Use (4)
- **Group C**: System_Complexity (1) < Ease_of_Use (5)
- **Group D**: System_Complexity (2.25) < Ease_of_Use (4.5)

None of the groups have a higher average 'System_Complexity' score than 'Ease_of_Use' score. Therefore, the count of respondents in groups where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score is 0.",True
case_45,conceptual_aggregation,How many respondents have a total positive usability score ('Ease_of_Use' + 'Integration_of_Functions') that is lower than the average for all respondents not in their group?,"@prefix : <http://example.org/survey#> .

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have a total positive usability score ('Ease_of_Use' + 'Integration_of_Functions') that is lower than the average for all respondents not in their group?
</task>","To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the average total positive usability score for each group, and then compare each respondent's score to the average of the other groups.

1. Calculate the total positive usability score for each respondent:
   - For each respondent, add the scores of 'Ease_of_Use' and 'Integration_of_Functions'.

2. Calculate the average total positive usability score for each group:
   - Group the respondents by their 'Group' and calculate the average of their total positive usability scores.

3. Compare each respondent's score to the average of the other groups:
   - For each respondent, calculate the average total positive usability score of all respondents not in their group.
   - Count how many respondents have a total positive usability score lower than this average.

Let's perform these steps with the given data:

### Step 1: Calculate total positive usability score for each respondent

| Respondent | Group | Ease_of_Use | Integration_of_Functions | Total Score |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Respondent35 | A | 1 | 1 | 2 |
| Respondent54 | C | 5 | 5 | 10 |
| Respondent63 | C | 5 | 5 | 10 |
| Respondent33 | C | 5 | 5 | 10 |
| Respondent11 | A | 5 | 5 | 10 |
| Respondent39 | C | 1 | 5 | 6 |
| Respondent44 | B | 5 | 2 | 7 |
| Respondent3 | B | 3 | 2 | 5 |
| Respondent10 | D | 4 | 5 | 9 |
| Respondent62 | C | 5 | 4 | 9 |

### Step 2: Calculate average total positive usability score for each group

- Group A: (2 + 10) / 2 = 12 / 2 = 6
- Group B: (7 + 5) / 2 = 12 / 2 = 6
- Group C: (10 + 10 + 10 + 6 + 9) / 5 = 45 / 5 = 9
- Group D: (9) / 1 = 9

### Step 3: Compare each respondent's score to the average of the other groups

- Respondent35 (Group A, Score 2): Average of other groups = (9 + 6 + 9) / 3 = 24 / 3 = 8. Since 2 < 8, count this respondent.
- Respondent54 (Group C, Score 10): Average of other groups = (6 + 6 + 9) / 3 = 21 / 3 = 7. Since 10 > 7, do not count this respondent.
- Respondent63 (Group C, Score 10): Same as Respondent54, do not count.
- Respondent33 (Group C, Score 10): Same as Respondent54, do not count.
- Respondent11 (Group A, Score 10): Average of other groups = (9 + 6 + 9) / 3 = 24 / 3 = 8. Since 10 > 8, do not count this respondent.
- Respondent39 (Group C, Score 6): Average of other groups = (6 + 6 + 9) / 3 = 21 / 3 = 7. Since 6 < 7, count this respondent.
- Respondent44 (Group B, Score 7): Average of other groups = (6 + 9 + 9) / 3 = 24 / 3 = 8. Since 7 < 8, count this respondent.
- Respondent3 (Group B, Score 5): Average of other groups = (6 + 9 + 9) / 3 = 24 / 3 = 8. Since 5 < 8, count this respondent.
- Respondent10 (Group D, Score 9): Average of other groups = (6 + 6 + 9) / 3 = 21 / 3 = 7. Since 9 > 7, do not count this respondent.
- Respondent62 (Group C, Score 9): Average of other groups = (6 + 6 + 9) / 3 = 21 / 3 = 7. Since 9 > 7, do not count this respondent.

Count of respondents with a total positive usability score lower than the average for all respondents not in their group: 4

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$",True
case_46,conceptual_aggregation,Count the respondents who are in a group where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score.,"@prefix : <http://example.org/survey#> .

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who are in a group where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'System_Complexity' and 'Ease_of_Use' scores for each group, and then compare these averages to determine which groups have a higher average 'System_Complexity' score. Finally, we count the respondents in those groups.

From the provided data:

1. **Group A**:
   - Respondent52: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 4
   - Respondent6: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 4
   - Respondent76: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
   - Respondent67: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
   - Average System_Complexity = (1 + 1 + 1 + 1) / 4 = 1
   - Average Ease_of_Use = (4 + 4 + 5 + 5) / 4 = 4.5

2. **Group C**:
   - Respondent82: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 4
   - Respondent20: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
   - Average System_Complexity = (1 + 1) / 2 = 1
   - Average Ease_of_Use = (4 + 5) / 2 = 4.5

3. **Group D**:
   - Respondent10: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 4
   - Respondent30: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
   - Average System_Complexity = (1 + 1) / 2 = 1
   - Average Ease_of_Use = (4 + 5) / 2 = 4.5

In all groups, the average 'System_Complexity' score is 1, and the average 'Ease_of_Use' score is higher (4.5). Therefore, there are no groups where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score.

The final answer is: 0",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who are in a group where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'System_Complexity' and 'Ease_of_Use' scores for each group, and then compare these averages to determine which groups have a higher average 'System_Complexity' score. Finally, we count the respondents in those groups.

From the provided data:

1. **Group A**:
   - Respondent46: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 1
   - Respondent56: System_Complexity = 2, Ease_of_Use = 4
   - Respondent59: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
   - Average System_Complexity = (1 + 2 + 1) / 3 = 4 / 3 = 1.33
   - Average Ease_of_Use = (1 + 4 + 5) / 3 = 10 / 3 = 3.33

2. **Group B**:
   - Respondent44: System_Complexity = 2, Ease_of_Use = 5
   - Respondent66: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
   - Respondent79: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
   - Average System_Complexity = (2 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 4 / 3 = 1.33
   - Average Ease_of_Use = (5 + 5 + 5) / 3 = 15 / 3 = 5

3. **Group C**:
   - Respondent9: System_Complexity = 3, Ease_of_Use = 1
   - Respondent33: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
   - Respondent50: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
   - Respondent51: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
   - Average System_Complexity = (3 + 1 + 1 + 1) / 4 = 6 / 4 = 1.5
   - Average Ease_of_Use = (1 + 5 + 5 + 5) / 4 = 16 / 4 = 4

4. **Group D**:
   - Respondent71: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
   - Respondent74: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
   - Average System_Complexity = (1 + 1) / 2 = 2 / 2 = 1
   - Average Ease_of_Use = (5 + 5) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5

Comparing the averages:
- Group A: Average System_Complexity (1.33) < Average Ease_of_Use (3.33)
- Group B: Average System_Complexity (1.33) < Average Ease_of_Use (5)
- Group C: Average System_Complexity (1.5) < Average Ease_of_Use (4)
- Group D: Average System_Complexity (1) < Average Ease_of_Use (5)

There are no groups where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score. Therefore, the count of respondents in such groups is 0.",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who are in a group where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'System_Complexity' and 'Ease_of_Use' scores for each group, and then compare these averages to determine which groups have a higher average 'System_Complexity' score than 'Ease_of_Use' score. Finally, we count the respondents in those groups.

Given the data:

1. **Respondent71**: Group D, System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
2. **Respondent41**: Group D, System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
3. **Respondent17**: Group C, System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
4. **Respondent72**: Group A, System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
5. **Respondent69**: Group B, System_Complexity = 4, Ease_of_Use = 5
6. **Respondent39**: Group C, System_Complexity = 4, Ease_of_Use = 1
7. **Respondent65**: Group A, System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
8. **Respondent25**: Group D, System_Complexity = 3, Ease_of_Use = 3

Let's calculate the averages for each group:

- **Group A**: 
  - System_Complexity: (1 + 1) / 2 = 2 / 2 = 1
  - Ease_of_Use: (5 + 5) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5
- **Group B**: 
  - System_Complexity: 4
  - Ease_of_Use: 5
- **Group C**: 
  - System_Complexity: (1 + 4) / 2 = 5 / 2 = 2.5
  - Ease_of_Use: (5 + 1) / 2 = 6 / 2 = 3
- **Group D**: 
  - System_Complexity: (1 + 1 + 3) / 3 = 5 / 3 ≈ 1.67
  - Ease_of_Use: (5 + 5 + 3) / 3 = 13 / 3 ≈ 4.33

Comparing the averages:

- **Group A**: System_Complexity (1) < Ease_of_Use (5)
- **Group B**: System_Complexity (4) < Ease_of_Use (5)
- **Group C**: System_Complexity (2.5) < Ease_of_Use (3)
- **Group D**: System_Complexity (1.67) < Ease_of_Use (4.33)

None of the groups have a higher average 'System_Complexity' score than 'Ease_of_Use' score. Therefore, the count of respondents in groups where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score is 0.",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who are in a group where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'System_Complexity' and 'Ease_of_Use' scores for each group, and then compare these averages to determine which groups have a higher average 'System_Complexity' score. Finally, we count the respondents in those groups.

From the provided data:

1. **Group A**:
   - Respondent42: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
   - Respondent6: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 4
   - Average System_Complexity = (1 + 1) / 2 = 1
   - Average Ease_of_Use = (5 + 4) / 2 = 4.5

2. **Group B**:
   - Respondent66: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
   - Respondent36: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
   - Average System_Complexity = (1 + 1) / 2 = 1
   - Average Ease_of_Use = (5 + 5) / 2 = 5

3. **Group C**:
   - Respondent9: System_Complexity = 3, Ease_of_Use = 1
   - Respondent53: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
   - Respondent88: System_Complexity = 2, Ease_of_Use = 5
   - Average System_Complexity = (3 + 1 + 2) / 3 = 2
   - Average Ease_of_Use = (1 + 5 + 5) / 3 = 3.67

4. **Group D**:
   - Respondent45: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 4
   - Respondent15: System_Complexity = 2, Ease_of_Use = 4
   - Respondent71: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
   - Respondent7: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
   - Average System_Complexity = (1 + 2 + 1 + 1) / 4 = 1.25
   - Average Ease_of_Use = (4 + 4 + 5 + 5) / 4 = 4.5

Comparing the averages:
- Group A: Average System_Complexity (1) < Average Ease_of_Use (4.5)
- Group B: Average System_Complexity (1) < Average Ease_of_Use (5)
- Group C: Average System_Complexity (2) > Average Ease_of_Use (3.67)
- Group D: Average System_Complexity (1.25) < Average Ease_of_Use (4.5)

Only **Group C** has a higher average 'System_Complexity' score than 'Ease_of_Use' score. The respondents in Group C are:
- Respondent9
- Respondent53
- Respondent88

Therefore, the number of respondents in a group where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score is **3**.",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have a total positive usability score ('Ease_of_Use' + 'Integration_of_Functions') that is lower than the average for all respondents not in their group?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average total positive usability score for each group, excluding the respondents in that group. Then, we compare each respondent's score to the average of the other groups to determine how many meet the condition.

1. **Calculate Total Positive Usability Score for Each Respondent:**
   - This score is the sum of 'Ease_of_Use' and 'Integration_of_Functions' for each respondent.

2. **Calculate Average Total Positive Usability Score for Each Group, Excluding Respondents in That Group:**
   - We will calculate the average for each group (A, B, C, D) by summing the scores of all respondents not in that group and then dividing by the number of those respondents.

3. **Compare Each Respondent's Score to the Average of the Other Groups:**
   - For each respondent, we will compare their total positive usability score to the average score of the groups they are not a part of.

Let's start with the calculations based on the provided data:

### Step 1: Calculate Total Positive Usability Score for Each Respondent

| Respondent | Group | Ease_of_Use | Integration_of_Functions | Total Score |
|------------|-------|-------------|--------------------------|-------------|
| Respondent64 | D     | 2           | 2                        | 4           |
| Respondent35 | A     | 1           | 1                        | 2           |
| Respondent47 | B     | 4           | 5                        | 9           |
| Respondent82 | C     | 4           | 4                        | 8           |
| Respondent32 | B     | 5           | 5                        | 10          |
| Respondent89 | A     | 3           | 5                        | 8           |
| Respondent61 | B     | 2           | 1                        | 3           |
| Respondent43 | C     | 5           | 5                        | 10          |
| Respondent11 | A     | 5           | 5                        | 10          |

### Step 2: Calculate Average Total Positive Usability Score for Each Group, Excluding Respondents in That Group

- **Group A Excluded:**
  - Respondents not in A: Respondent64 (D), Respondent47 (B), Respondent82 (C), Respondent32 (B), Respondent61 (B), Respondent43 (C)
  - Scores: 4 (64), 9 (47), 8 (82), 10 (32), 3 (61), 10 (43)
  - Average = (4 + 9 + 8 + 10 + 3 + 10) / 6 = 44 / 6 = 7.33

- **Group B Excluded:**
  - Respondents not in B: Respondent64 (D), Respondent35 (A), Respondent82 (C), Respondent89 (A), Respondent43 (C), Respondent11 (A)
  - Scores: 4 (64), 2 (35), 8 (82), 8 (89), 10 (43), 10 (11)
  - Average = (4 + 2 + 8 + 8 + 10 + 10) / 6 = 42 / 6 = 7

- **Group C Excluded:**
  - Respondents not in C: Respondent64 (D), Respondent35 (A), Respondent47 (B), Respondent32 (B), Respondent89 (A), Respondent61 (B), Respondent11 (A)
  - Scores: 4 (64), 2 (35), 9 (47), 10 (32), 8 (89), 3 (61), 10 (11)
  - Average = (4 + 2 + 9 + 10 + 8 + 3 + 10) / 7 = 46 / 7 = 6.57

- **Group D Excluded:**
  - Respondents not in D: Respondent35 (A), Respondent47 (B), Respondent82 (C), Respondent32 (B), Respondent89 (A), Respondent61 (B), Respondent43 (C), Respondent11 (A)
  - Scores: 2 (35), 9 (47), 8 (82), 10 (32), 8 (89), 3 (61), 10 (43), 10 (11)
  - Average = (2 + 9 + 8 + 10 + 8 + 3 + 10 + 10) / 8 = 60 / 8 = 7.5

### Step 3: Compare Each Respondent's Score to the Average of the Other Groups

- **Respondent64 (D):** Score = 4, Average of other groups = 7.5, **Meets condition** (4 < 7.5)
- **Respondent35 (A):** Score = 2, Average of other groups = 7, **Meets condition** (2 < 7)
- **Respondent47 (B):** Score = 9, Average of other groups = 6.57, Does not meet condition (9 > 6.57)
- **Respondent82 (C):** Score = 8, Average of other groups = 7.33, Does not meet condition (8 > 7.33)
- **Respondent32 (B):** Score = 10, Average of other groups = 6.57, Does not meet condition (10 > 6.57)
- **Respondent89 (A):** Score = 8, Average of other groups = 7, Does not meet condition (8 > 7)
- **Respondent61 (B):** Score = 3, Average of other groups = 6.57, **Meets condition** (3 < 6.57)
- **Respondent43 (C):** Score = 10, Average of other groups = 7.33, Does not meet condition (10 > 7.33)
- **Respondent11 (A):** Score = 10, Average of other groups = 7, Does not meet condition (10 > 7)

### Conclusion

3 respondents meet the condition of having a total positive usability score lower than the average for all respondents not in their group.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$",True
