<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents from the 'Senior' rated 'Integration_of_Functions' as 3?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to identify respondents who belong to the 'Senior' group and have rated 'Integration_of_Functions' as 3.

From the 'questions' section, we understand that the 'Group' is categorized as [MCQ: A. Senior B. Junior C. Middle D. Intern], so 'Senior' corresponds to option A.

Looking through the 'responses' section for respondents who are classified as 'Senior' (Group: A) and have rated 'Integration_of_Functions' as 3, we find:

- Respondent 58, who is a 'Senior' (A) and rated 'Integration_of_Functions' as 3.

There is only one respondent who matches this criterion.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents from the 'Junior' rated 'Integration_of_Functions' as 4?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to identify respondents who belong to the 'Junior' group and have rated 'Integration_of_Functions' as 4.

From the 'questions' section, we understand that the 'Group' field is a multiple-choice question with options A. Senior, B. Junior, C. Middle, D. Intern. Therefore, respondents belonging to the 'Junior' group will have 'B' marked under the 'Group' field in the 'responses' section.

We then need to find respondents with 'Group' as 'B' (Junior) and 'Integration_of_Functions' rated as 4.

Upon reviewing the responses:

- Respondent 26 has 'Group' as B and 'Integration_of_Functions' as 4.

There is only 1 respondent from the 'Junior' group who rated 'Integration_of_Functions' as 4.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the respondents whose combined score for 'Frequent_Usage' and 'Ease_of_Learning' is less than 6.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to examine each respondent's scores for 'Frequent_Usage' and 'Ease_of_Learning', add these two scores together, and then count how many of these combined scores are less than 6.

Let's calculate the combined scores for each respondent:

### Respondent 84
- **Frequent_Usage:** 3
- **Ease_of_Learning:** 2
- Combined score: 3 + 2 = 5

### Respondent 62
- **Frequent_Usage:** 1
- **Ease_of_Learning:** 1
- Combined score: 1 + 1 = 2

### Respondent 90
- **Frequent_Usage:** 5
- **Ease_of_Learning:** 5
- Combined score: 5 + 5 = 10

### Respondent 36
- **Frequent_Usage:** 1
- **Ease_of_Learning:** 5
- Combined score: 1 + 5 = 6

### Respondent 37
- **Frequent_Usage:** 4
- **Ease_of_Learning:** 5
- Combined score: 4 + 5 = 9

Now, let's count the respondents whose combined score is less than 6:

- Respondent 84 has a combined score of 5, which is less than 6.
- Respondent 62 has a combined score of 2, which is less than 6.
- Respondent 36 has a combined score of 6, which is not less than 6.
- Respondent 90 has a combined score of 10, which is not less than 6.
- Respondent 37 has a combined score of 9, which is not less than 6.

Therefore, there are 2 respondents whose combined score for 'Frequent_Usage' and 'Ease_of_Learning' is less than 6.",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose combined score for 'Frequent_Usage' and 'Need_for_Technical_Support' is less than 6.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to examine each respondent's scores for 'Frequent_Usage' and 'Need_for_Technical_Support', add these two scores together, and then count how many of these combined scores are less than 6.

Let's calculate the combined scores:

### Respondent 70
- **Frequent_Usage:** 5
- **Need_for_Technical_Support:** 1
- Combined score: 5 + 1 = 6

### Respondent 38
- **Frequent_Usage:** 3
- **Need_for_Technical_Support:** 3
- Combined score: 3 + 3 = 6

### Respondent 79
- **Frequent_Usage:** 5
- **Need_for_Technical_Support:** 2
- Combined score: 5 + 2 = 7

### Respondent 4
- **Frequent_Usage:** 4
- **Need_for_Technical_Support:** 1
- Combined score: 4 + 1 = 5

### Respondent 80
- **Frequent_Usage:** 5
- **Need_for_Technical_Support:** 3
- Combined score: 5 + 3 = 8

Now, let's count the respondents whose combined score is less than 6:

- Respondent 4 has a combined score of 5, which is less than 6.

Therefore, there is 1 respondent whose combined score for 'Frequent_Usage' and 'Need_for_Technical_Support' is less than 6.",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose combined score for 'System_Complexity' and 'Ease_of_Use' is less than 6.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to go through each respondent's data, calculate the combined score for 'System_Complexity' and 'Ease_of_Use', and then count how many of these combined scores are less than 6.

Let's calculate the combined scores:

### Respondent 10
- **System_Complexity:** 1
- **Ease_of_Use:** 4
Combined score: 1 + 4 = 5

### Respondent 28
- **System_Complexity:** 1
- **Ease_of_Use:** 5
Combined score: 1 + 5 = 6

### Respondent 19
- **System_Complexity:** 1
- **Ease_of_Use:** 5
Combined score: 1 + 5 = 6

### Respondent 39
- **System_Complexity:** 4
- **Ease_of_Use:** 1
Combined score: 4 + 1 = 5

### Respondent 90
- **System_Complexity:** 1
- **Ease_of_Use:** 5
Combined score: 1 + 5 = 6

### Respondent 31
- **System_Complexity:** 1
- **Ease_of_Use:** 2
Combined score: 1 + 2 = 3

### Respondent 64
- **System_Complexity:** 3
- **Ease_of_Use:** 2
Combined score: 3 + 2 = 5

### Respondent 4
- **System_Complexity:** 1

Combined score: 1 + 5 = 6

### Respondent 5
- **System_Complexity:** 1
- **Ease_of_Use:** 5
Combined score: 1 + 5 = 6

Now, let's count the respondents whose combined score is less than 6:
- Respondent 10: 5
- Respondent 39: 5

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose combined score for 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' and 'Frequent_Usage' is less than 3.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to examine each respondent's scores for 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' and 'Frequent_Usage', add these two scores together, and then count how many respondents have a combined score of less than 3.

Let's calculate the combined scores:

- Respondent 74: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 1, 'Frequent_Usage' = 5, Combined = 6
- Respondent 22: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 2, 'Frequent_Usage' = 1, Combined = 3
- Respondent 81: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 2, 'Frequent_Usage' = 1, Combined = 3
- Respondent 30: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 1, 'Frequent_Usage' = 3, Combined = 4
- Respondent 36: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 1, 'Frequent_Usage' = 1, Combined = 2
- Respondent 62: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 1, 'Frequent_Usage' = 1, Combined = 2
- Respondent 84: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 1, 'Frequent_Usage' = 3, Combined = 4
- Respondent 69: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 1, 'Frequent_Usage' = 3, Combined = 4

Now, let's count the respondents with a combined score of less than 3:

- Respondent 36 has a combined score of 2.
- Respondent 62 has a combined score of 2.

Therefore, there are 2 respondents whose combined score for 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' and 'Frequent_Usage' is less than 3.",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents from the 'Middle' group rated 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' as 4 and 'Frequent_Usage' as 1?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to examine each respondent's data and identify those who belong to the 'Middle' group, rated 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' as 4, and rated 'Frequent_Usage' as 1.

From the provided data:

- Respondent 9 is in the 'Middle' group, but their 'Frequent_Usage' is 2 and 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' is also not 4, it's actually the 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' that matches one of our criteria but not the other.
- Respondent 4 is in the 'Middle' group, but their 'Frequent_Usage' is 4 and 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' is 1, so they don't match.
- Respondent 50 is in the 'Middle' group, but their 'Frequent_Usage' is 1 and 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' is 1, so they don't match.
- Respondent 40 is in the 'Middle' group, but their 'Frequent_Usage' is 5 and 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' is 1, so they don't match.

However, upon closer inspection, none of the respondents in the 'Middle' group (C) have both 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' rated as 4 and 'Frequent_Usage' as 1.

1. Respondent 71: Ease_of_Use = 5, Frequent_Usage = 3, Combined = 8
2. Respondent 43: Ease_of_Use = 5, Frequent_Usage = 3, Combined = 8
3. Respondent 17: Ease_of_Use = 5, Frequent_Usage = 5, Combined = 10
4. Respondent 44: Ease_of_Use = 5, Frequent_Usage = 3, Combined = 8
5. Respondent 20: Ease_of_Use = 5, Frequent_Usage = 1, Combined = 6
6. Respondent 37: Ease_of_Use = 5, Frequent_Usage = 4, Combined = 9
7. Respondent 56: Ease_of_Use = 4, Frequent_Usage = 5, Combined = 9

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose combined score for 'Need_for_Technical_Support' and 'Inconsistency' is less than 2.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to examine each respondent's scores for 'Need_for_Technical_Support' and 'Inconsistency', add these scores together, and then count how many of these combined scores are less than 2.

Let's calculate the combined scores:

1. Respondent 82: Need_for_Technical_Support = 1, Inconsistency = 1, Combined = 2
2. Respondent 54: Need_for_Technical_Support = 3, Inconsistency = 1, Combined = 4
3. Respondent 55: Need_for_Technical_Support = 1, Inconsistency = 1, Combined = 2
4. Respondent 14: Need_for_Technical_Support = 1, Inconsistency = 1, Combined = 2
5. Respondent 9: Need_for_Technical_Support = 5, Inconsistency = 5, Combined = 10
6. Respondent 47: Need_for_Technical_Support = 1, Inconsistency = 1, Combined = 2
7. Respondent 90: Need_for_Technical_Support = 2, Inconsistency = 2, Combined = 4
8. Respondent 60: Need_for_Technical_Support = 1, Inconsistency = 2, Combined = 3
9. Respondent 48: Need_for_Technical_Support = 1, Inconsistency = 1, Combined = 2
10. Respondent 6: Need_for_Technical_Support = 1, Inconsistency = 1, Combined = 2
11. Respondent 78: Need_for_Technical_Support = 4, Inconsistency = 4, Combined = 8

From the calculations, we see that none of the respondents have a combined score less than 2.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the respondents who are in a group where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'System_Complexity' and 'Ease_of_Use' scores for each group, and then compare these averages to determine which groups have a higher average 'System_Complexity' score. Finally, we count the respondents in those groups.

Given the data:

1. **Respondent 49**: Group D, System_Complexity = 5, Ease_of_Use = 5
2. **Respondent 43**: Group C, System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
3. **Respondent 30**: Group D, System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
4. **Respondent 22**: Group C, System_Complexity = 2, Ease_of_Use = 4
5. **Respondent 50**: Group C, System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
6. **Respondent 74**: Group D, System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
7. **Respondent 89**: Group A, System_Complexity = 2, Ease_of_Use = 3

9. **Respondent 71**: Group D, System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
10. **Respondent 36**: Group B, System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5

Let's calculate the averages for each group:

- **Group A**: System_Complexity = 2, Ease_of_Use = 3 (Only Respondent 89)
- **Group B**: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5 (Only Respondent 36)
- **Group C**: 
  - System_Complexity = (1 + 2 + 1 + 1) / 4 = 5 / 4 = 1.25
  - Ease_of_Use = (5 + 4 + 5 + 5) / 4 = 19 / 4 = 4.75
- **Group D**: 
  - System_Complexity = (5 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1) / 5 = 9 / 5 = 1.8
  - Ease_of_Use = (5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5) / 5 = 25 / 5 = 5

Comparing the averages:
- **Group A**: System_Complexity (2) > Ease_of_Use (3) is False
- **Group B**: System_Complexity (1) > Ease_of_Use (5) is False
- **Group C**: System_Complexity (1.25) > Ease_of_Use (4.75) is False
- **Group D**: System_Complexity (1.8) > Ease_of_Use (5) is False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
How many respondents in the 'Junior' group have a 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score that is higher than the average 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' for the 'Intern' group?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score for the 'Intern' group. Then, we will identify the respondents in the 'Junior' group and check how many of them have a 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score higher than this average.

1. **Identify 'Intern' group respondents and their 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' scores:**
   - Respondent 15: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 2
   - Respondent 29: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 1
   - Respondent 18: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 1
   - Respondent 12: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 2

2. **Calculate the average 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score for the 'Intern' group:**
   - Average = (2 + 1 + 1 + 2) / 4 = 6 / 4 = 1.5

3. **Identify 'Junior' group respondents and their 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' scores:**
   - Respondent 36: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 1
   - Respondent 32: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 1
   - Respondent 14: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 3

4. **Determine how many 'Junior' group respondents have a 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score higher than the 'Intern' group average (1.5):**
   - Respondent 14 has a score of 3, which is higher than 1.5.
   - Respondents 36 and 32 have scores of 1, which are not higher than 1.5.

Therefore, there is **1** respondent in the 'Junior' group with a 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score higher than the average for the 'Intern' group.",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
How many respondents in the 'Intern' group have a 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score that is higher than the average 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' for the 'Senior' group?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score for the 'Senior' group and then find out how many respondents in the 'Intern' group have a score higher than this average.

1. **Identify 'Senior' Group Respondents and Their 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' Scores:**
   - Respondent 86: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 2
   - Respondent 13: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 1
   - Respondent 59: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 1

2. **Calculate the Average 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' Score for the 'Senior' Group:**
   - Average = (2 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 4 / 3 = 1.33

3. **Identify 'Intern' Group Respondents and Their 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' Scores:**
   - Respondent 90: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 1
   - Respondent 60: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 2
   - Respondent 48: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 1
   - Respondent 77: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 1
   - Respondent 64: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 5
   - Respondent 78: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 5

4. **Count 'Intern' Group Respondents with 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' Score Higher Than the 'Senior' Group Average (1.33):**
   - Respondent 60: 2 > 1.33
   - Respondent 64: 5 > 1.33
   - Respondent 78: 5 > 1.33

Therefore, there are 3 respondents in the 'Intern' group with a 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score higher than the average for the 'Senior' group.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who are in a group where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'System_Complexity' and 'Ease_of_Use' scores for each group, and then compare these averages to determine which groups have a higher average 'System_Complexity' score than 'Ease_of_Use' score. Finally, we count the respondents in those groups.

Let's calculate the averages for each group based on the provided responses:

### Group A
- Respondent 67:
  - **System_Complexity:** 1
  - **Ease_of_Use:** 5
- Average **System_Complexity:** 1
- Average **Ease_of_Use:** 5

### Group B
- Respondent 23:
  - **System_Complexity:** 1
  - **Ease_of_Use:** 4
- Average **System_Complexity:** 1
- Average **Ease_of_Use:** 4

### Group C
- Respondent 53:
  - **System_Complexity:** 1
  - **Ease_of_Use:** 5
- Respondent 70:
  - **System_Complexity:** 1
  - **Ease_of_Use:** 5
- Average **System_Complexity:** 1
- Average **Ease_of_Use:** 5

### Group D
- Respondent 90:
  - **System_Complexity:** 1
  - **Ease_of_Use:** 5
- Respondent 15:
  - **System_Complexity:** 2
  - **Ease_of_Use:** 4
- Respondent 49:
  - **System_Complexity:** 5
  - **Ease_of_Use:** 5
- Respondent 29:
  - **System_Complexity:** 1
  - **Ease_of_Use:** 4
- Average **System_Complexity:** (1 + 2 + 5 + 1) / 4 = 9 / 4 = 2.25
- Average **Ease_of_Use:** (5 + 4 + 5 + 4) / 4 = 18 / 4 = 4.5

From the calculations, we see that none of the groups have a higher average 'System_Complexity' score than 'Ease_of_Use' score, except potentially for a misunderstanding in the calculation for Group D, which actually does not meet the criteria upon correct calculation (2.25 < 4.5).

Thus, there are no groups where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score based on the provided data. 

The final answer is: $\boxed{0}$",True
case_45,conceptual_aggregation,How many respondents have a total positive usability score ('Ease_of_Use' + 'Integration_of_Functions') that is lower than the average for all respondents not in their group?,"# Survey Data

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").

<task>
How many respondents have a total positive usability score ('Ease_of_Use' + 'Integration_of_Functions') that is lower than the average for all respondents not in their group?
</task>","To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the average total positive usability score for each group, and then compare each respondent's score to the average of the other groups.

1. **Calculate Total Positive Usability Score for Each Respondent:**
   - This score is the sum of 'Ease_of_Use' and 'Integration_of_Functions' for each respondent.

2. **Calculate Average Total Positive Usability Score for Each Group:**
   - We need to calculate the average score for respondents in each group (A, B, C, D) separately.

3. **Compare Each Respondent's Score to the Average of the Other Groups:**
   - For each respondent, we will calculate the average total positive usability score of the groups they are not in.
   - We then compare this average to the respondent's own score.

Let's start with the calculations:

### Step 1: Calculate Total Positive Usability Score for Each Respondent

| Respondent | Group | Ease_of_Use | Integration_of_Functions | Total Score |
|------------|-------|-------------|--------------------------|-------------|
| 35         | A     | 1           | 1                        | 2           |
| 54         | C     | 5           | 5                        | 10          |
| 63         | C     | 5           | 5                        | 10          |
| 33         | C     | 5           | 5                        | 10          |
| 11         | A     | 5           | 5                        | 10          |
| 39         | C     | 1           | 5                        | 6           |
| 44         | B     | 5           | 2                        | 7           |
| 3          | B     | 3           | 2                        | 5           |
| 10         | D     | 4           | 5                        | 9           |
| 62         | C     | 5           | 4                        | 9           |

### Step 2: Calculate Average Total Positive Usability Score for Each Group

- **Group A:** (2 + 10) / 2 = 12 / 2 = 6
- **Group B:** (7 + 5) / 2 = 12 / 2 = 6
- **Group C:** (10 + 10 + 10 + 6 + 9) / 5 = 45 / 5 = 9
- **Group D:** (9) / 1 = 9

### Step 3: Compare Each Respondent's Score to the Average of the Other Groups

- **Respondent 35 (Group A):** Average of other groups = (9 + 6 + 9) / 3 = 24 / 3 = 8. Since 2 < 8, this respondent qualifies.
- **Respondent 54 (Group C):** Average of other groups = (6 + 6 + 9) / 3 = 21 / 3 = 7. Since 10 > 7, this respondent does not qualify.
- **Respondent 63 (Group C):** Same as Respondent 54, does not qualify.
- **Respondent 33 (Group C):** Same as Respondent 54, does not qualify.
- **Respondent 11 (Group A):** Average of other groups = (9 + 6 + 9) / 3 = 24 / 3 = 8. Since 10 > 8, this respondent does not qualify.
- **Respondent 39 (Group C):** Average of other groups = (6 + 6 + 9) / 3 = 21 / 3 = 7. Since 6 < 7, this respondent qualifies.
- **Respondent 44 (Group B):** Average of other groups = (6 + 9 + 9) / 3 = 24 / 3 = 8. Since 7 < 8, this respondent qualifies.
- **Respondent 3 (Group B):** Average of other groups = (6 + 9 + 9) / 3 = 24 / 3 = 8. Since 5 < 8, this respondent qualifies.
- **Respondent 10 (Group D):** Average of other groups = (6 + 6 + 9) / 3 = 21 / 3 = 7. Since 9 > 7, this respondent does not qualify.
- **Respondent 62 (Group C):** Average of other groups = (6 + 6 + 9) / 3 = 21 / 3 = 7. Since 9 > 7, this respondent does not qualify.

<task>
Count the respondents who are in a group where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'System_Complexity' and 'Ease_of_Use' scores for each group, and then compare these averages to determine which groups have a higher average 'System_Complexity' score. Finally, we count the respondents in those groups.

Given the data:

1. **Respondent 10**: Group D, System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 4
2. **Respondent 52**: Group A, System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 4
3. **Respondent 6**: Group A, System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 4
4. **Respondent 76**: Group A, System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
5. **Respondent 30**: Group D, System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
6. **Respondent 82**: Group C, System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 4
7. **Respondent 67**: Group A, System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
8. **Respondent 20**: Group C, System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5

Calculating averages for each group:

- **Group A**: 
  - System_Complexity: (1 + 1 + 1 + 1) / 4 = 1
  - Ease_of_Use: (4 + 4 + 5 + 5) / 4 = 4.5
- **Group C**:
  - System_Complexity: (1 + 1) / 2 = 1
  - Ease_of_Use: (4 + 5) / 2 = 4.5
- **Group D**:
  - System_Complexity: (1 + 1) / 2 = 1

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who are in a group where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'System_Complexity' and 'Ease_of_Use' scores for each group, and then compare these averages to determine which groups have a higher average 'System_Complexity' score. Finally, we count the respondents in those groups.

Let's calculate the averages for each group:

- **Group A**: 
  - System_Complexity: (1 + 2 + 1) / 3 = 4 / 3 = 1.33
  - Ease_of_Use: (1 + 4 + 5) / 3 = 10 / 3 = 3.33
- **Group B**:
  - System_Complexity: (2 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 4 / 3 = 1.33
  - Ease_of_Use: (5 + 5 + 5) / 3 = 15 / 3 = 5
- **Group C**:
  - System_Complexity: (3 + 1 + 1 + 1) / 4 = 6 / 4 = 1.5
  - Ease_of_Use: (1 + 5 + 5 + 5) / 4 = 16 / 4 = 4
- **Group D**:
  - System_Complexity: (1 + 1) / 2 = 2 / 2 = 1
  - Ease_of_Use: (5 + 5) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5

Comparing the averages:
- **Group A**: System_Complexity (1.33) < Ease_of_Use (3.33)
- **Group B**: System_Complexity (1.33) < Ease_of_Use (5)
- **Group C**: System_Complexity (1.5) < Ease_of_Use (4)
- **Group D**: System_Complexity (1) < Ease_of_Use (5)

None of the groups have a higher average 'System_Complexity' score than their average 'Ease_of_Use' score. Therefore, there are no respondents in groups where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who are in a group where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'System_Complexity' and 'Ease_of_Use' scores for each group, and then compare these averages to determine which groups have a higher average 'System_Complexity' score than 'Ease_of_Use' score. Finally, we count the respondents in those groups.

Let's calculate the averages for each group based on the provided responses:

### Group A
- Respondent 72: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
- Respondent 65: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
- Average System_Complexity = (1 + 1) / 2 = 1
- Average Ease_of_Use = (5 + 5) / 2 = 5

### Group B
- Respondent 69: System_Complexity = 4, Ease_of_Use = 5
- Average System_Complexity = 4
- Average Ease_of_Use = 5

### Group C
- Respondent 17: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
- Respondent 39: System_Complexity = 4, Ease_of_Use = 1
- Average System_Complexity = (1 + 4) / 2 = 2.5
- Average Ease_of_Use = (5 + 1) / 2 = 3

### Group D
- Respondent 71: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
- Respondent 41: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
- Respondent 25: System_Complexity = 3, Ease_of_Use = 3
- Average System_Complexity = (1 + 1 + 3) / 3 = 1.67
- Average Ease_of_Use = (5 + 5 + 3) / 3 = 4.33

Now, comparing the averages:
- Group A: Average System_Complexity (1) < Average Ease_of_Use (5)
- Group B: Average System_Complexity (4) < Average Ease_of_Use (5)
- Group C: Average System_Complexity (2.5) < Average Ease_of_Use (3)
- Group D: Average System_Complexity (1.67) < Average Ease_of_Use (4.33)

There are no groups where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score. Therefore, the count of respondents in such groups is 0.",True
case_49,conceptual_aggregation,Count the respondents who are in a group where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score.,"# Survey Data

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who are in a group where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'System_Complexity' and 'Ease_of_Use' scores for each group, and then compare these averages to determine which groups have a higher average 'System_Complexity' score. Finally, we count the respondents in those groups.

Let's calculate the averages for each group based on the provided responses:

### Group A
- Respondent 42: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
- Respondent 6: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 4
- Average System_Complexity = (1 + 1) / 2 = 1
- Average Ease_of_Use = (5 + 4) / 2 = 4.5

### Group B
- Respondent 66: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
- Respondent 36: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
- Average System_Complexity = (1 + 1) / 2 = 1
- Average Ease_of_Use = (5 + 5) / 2 = 5

### Group C
- Respondent 9: System_Complexity = 3, Ease_of_Use = 1
- Respondent 53: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
- Respondent 88: System_Complexity = 2, Ease_of_Use = 5
- Average System_Complexity = (3 + 1 + 2) / 3 = 2
- Average Ease_of_Use = (1 + 5 + 5) / 3 = 3.67

### Group D
- Respondent 45: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 4
- Respondent 15: System_Complexity = 2, Ease_of_Use = 4
- Respondent 71: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
- Respondent 7: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
- Average System_Complexity = (1 + 2 + 1 + 1) / 4 = 1.25
- Average Ease_of_Use = (4 + 4 + 5 + 5) / 4 = 4.5

Now, comparing the averages:
- Group A: System_Complexity (1) < Ease_of_Use (4.5)
- Group B: System_Complexity (1) < Ease_of_Use (5)
- Group C: System_Complexity (2) > Ease_of_Use (3.67)
- Group D: System_Complexity (1.25) < Ease_of_Use (4.5)

Only Group C has a higher average 'System_Complexity' score than 'Ease_of_Use' score. The respondents in Group C are:
- Respondent 9
- Respondent 53
- Respondent 88

Therefore, the count of respondents who are in a group where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score is 3.",False
case_50,conceptual_aggregation,How many respondents have a total positive usability score ('Ease_of_Use' + 'Integration_of_Functions') that is lower than the average for all respondents not in their group?,"# Survey Data

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have a total positive usability score ('Ease_of_Use' + 'Integration_of_Functions') that is lower than the average for all respondents not in their group?
</task>","To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the average total positive usability score for each group and then compare each respondent's score to the average of the other groups.

1. **Calculate Total Positive Usability Score for Each Respondent:**
   - This score is the sum of 'Ease_of_Use' and 'Integration_of_Functions' for each respondent.

2. **Calculate Average Total Positive Usability Score for Each Group:**
   - Group A: Respondents 35, 89, 11
   - Group B: Respondents 47, 32, 61
   - Group C: Respondents 82, 43
   - Group D: Respondent 64

3. **Compute Scores:**

   - **Respondent 64 (Group D):** Ease_of_Use = 2, Integration_of_Functions = 2, Total = 4
   - **Respondent 35 (Group A):** Ease_of_Use = 1, Integration_of_Functions = 1, Total = 2
   - **Respondent 47 (Group B):** Ease_of_Use = 4, Integration_of_Functions = 5, Total = 9
   - **Respondent 82 (Group C):** Ease_of_Use = 4, Integration_of_Functions = 4, Total = 8
   - **Respondent 32 (Group B):** Ease_of_Use = 5, Integration_of_Functions = 5, Total = 10
   - **Respondent 89 (Group A):** Ease_of_Use = 3, Integration_of_Functions = 5, Total = 8
   - **Respondent 61 (Group B):** Ease_of_Use = 2, Integration_of_Functions = 1, Total = 3
   - **Respondent 43 (Group C):** Ease_of_Use = 5, Integration_of_Functions = 5, Total = 10
   - **Respondent 11 (Group A):** Ease_of_Use = 5, Integration_of_Functions = 5, Total = 10

4. **Calculate Average for Each Group:**
   - **Group A:** (2 + 8 + 10) / 3 = 20 / 3 = 6.67
   - **Group B:** (9 + 10 + 3) / 3 = 22 / 3 = 7.33
   - **Group C:** (8 + 10) / 2 = 18 / 2 = 9
   - **Group D:** 4 (only one respondent)

5. **Compare Each Respondent's Score to the Average of the Other Groups:**
   - For each respondent, calculate the average score of the groups they are not in and compare.

6. **Count Respondents with Score Lower than Average of Other Groups:**
   - **Respondent 64 (Group D):** Average of other groups = (6.67 + 7.33 + 9) / 3 = 23 / 3 = 7.67, Score = 4, Lower.
   - **Respondent 35 (Group A):** Average of other groups = (7.33 + 9 + 4) / 3 = 20.33 / 3 = 6.78, Score = 2, Lower.
   - **Respondent 47 (Group B):** Average of other groups = (6.67 + 9 + 4) / 3 = 19.67 / 3 = 6.56, Score = 9, Not Lower.
   - **Respondent 82 (Group C):** Average of other groups = (6.67 + 7.33 + 4) / 3 = 18 / 3 = 6, Score = 8, Not Lower.
   - **Respondent 32 (Group B):** Average of other groups = (6.67 + 9 + 4) / 3 = 19.67 / 3 = 6.56, Score = 10, Not Lower.
   - **Respondent 89 (Group A):** Average of other groups = (7.33 + 9 + 4) / 3 = 20.33 / 3 = 6.78, Score = 8, Not Lower.
   - **Respondent 61 (Group B):** Average of other groups = (6.67 + 9 + 4) / 3 = 19.67 / 3 = 6.56, Score = 3, Lower.
   - **Respondent 43 (Group C):** Average of other groups = (6.67 + 7.33 + 4) / 3 = 18 / 3 = 6, Score = 10, Not Lower.
   - **Respondent 11 (Group A):** Average of other groups = (7.33 + 9 + 4) / 3 = 20.33 / 3 = 6.78, Score = 10, Not Lower.

7. **Count:**
   - Respondents with a score lower than the average of the other groups: 64, 35, 61.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$",True
