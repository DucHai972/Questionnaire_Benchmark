<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondents are in the same group as respondent '47'?
</task>","To determine which respondents are in the same group as respondent '47', we first need to identify the group of respondent '47'. According to the data, respondent '47' has an answer for ""Group"" as ""B"", which corresponds to ""Junior"" based on the schema provided.

Now, we need to find all respondents who also belong to group ""B"" (Junior). Looking through the responses:

- Respondent '8' is in group ""B"".
- Respondent '47' is in group ""B"".

Therefore, the respondents in the same group as respondent '47' are '8' and '47'. However, since the question asks for respondents other than '47' who are in the same group, we consider '8' and any other potential matches. Upon reviewing the data again, there are no other respondents in group ""B"" besides '8' and '47'.

The final answer is: 8",True

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
List all respondents who rated 'System_Complexity' the same as respondent '76'.
</task>","To find the respondents who rated 'System_Complexity' the same as respondent '76', we first need to determine how respondent '76' rated 'System_Complexity'. According to the data, respondent '76' rated 'System_Complexity' as ""1"", which means they strongly disagree that the system is unnecessarily complex.

Now, we will go through the responses to find all respondents who also rated 'System_Complexity' as ""1"".

- Respondent ""31"" rated 'System_Complexity' as ""1"".
- Respondent ""70"" rated 'System_Complexity' as ""1"".
- Respondent ""17"" rated 'System_Complexity' as ""1"".
- Respondent ""48"" rated 'System_Complexity' as ""1"".
- Respondent ""78"" rated 'System_Complexity' as ""1"".
- Respondent ""81"" rated 'System_Complexity' as ""1"".

Therefore, the respondents who rated 'System_Complexity' the same as respondent '76' are: 31, 70, 17, 48, 78, 81.",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents who rated 'Integration_of_Functions' the same as respondent '84'.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents are in the same group as respondent '34'?
</task>","To determine which respondents are in the same group as respondent '34', we first need to identify the group of respondent '34'. According to the data, respondent '34' has an answer for ""Group"" as ""A"". 

Referring to the 'questions' schema, ""Group"" is defined as ""[MCQ: A. Senior B. Junior C. Middle D. Intern]"". Therefore, respondent '34' is in the ""Senior"" group.

Next, we need to find other respondents who are also in the ""Senior"" group, which corresponds to answer ""A"" for the ""Group"" question. 

From the 'responses' section, besides respondent '34', respondent '11' also has an answer of ""A"" for the ""Group"" question. 

Thus, the respondents in the same group as respondent '34' are '11' and '34'. However, since the question asks for respondents other than '34' who are in the same group, we only consider '11'. 

The final answer is: 11",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents who gave the same 'Ease_of_Use' score as respondent '51', excluding the respondent themselves.
</task>","To find the respondents who gave the same 'Ease_of_Use' score as respondent '51', we first need to determine the 'Ease_of_Use' score of respondent '51'. According to the data, respondent '51' has an 'Ease_of_Use' score of ""5"".

Next, we need to find all other respondents who also have an 'Ease_of_Use' score of ""5"". Looking through the responses:

- Respondent '42' has an 'Ease_of_Use' score of ""5"".
- Respondent '20' has an 'Ease_of_Use' score of ""5"".
- Respondent '7' has an 'Ease_of_Use' score of ""5"".

Respondent '84' does not have an 'Ease_of_Use' score of ""5"", so they are excluded.

Therefore, the respondents who gave the same 'Ease_of_Use' score as respondent '51', excluding respondent '51' themselves, are '42', '20', and '7'. 

The final answer is: 42, 20, 7",False

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents who gave the same 'Ease_of_Use' score as respondent '5', excluding the respondent themselves.
</task>","To find the respondents who gave the same 'Ease_of_Use' score as respondent '5', we first need to determine the 'Ease_of_Use' score of respondent '5'. According to the data, respondent '5' has an 'Ease_of_Use' score of ""5"".

Next, we will go through the responses of all other respondents to find those who also have an 'Ease_of_Use' score of ""5"".

Respondent '74' has an 'Ease_of_Use' score of ""5"".
Respondent '62' has an 'Ease_of_Use' score of ""5"".
Respondent '2' has an 'Ease_of_Use' score of ""4"", which does not match.
Respondent '55' has an 'Ease_of_Use' score of ""2"", which does not match.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents who gave the same 'Ease_of_Use' score as respondent '45', excluding the respondent themselves.
</task>","To find the respondents who gave the same 'Ease_of_Use' score as respondent '45', we first need to determine the 'Ease_of_Use' score of respondent '45'. According to the data, respondent '45' has an 'Ease_of_Use' score of ""4"".

Next, we will go through the responses of all other respondents to find those who also have an 'Ease_of_Use' score of ""4"".

Respondent '61' has an 'Ease_of_Use' score of ""2"".
Respondent '35' has an 'Ease_of_Use' score of ""1"".
Respondent '85' has an 'Ease_of_Use' score of ""5"".
Respondent '68' has an 'Ease_of_Use' score of ""4"".
Respondent '86' has an 'Ease_of_Use' score of ""1"".
Respondent '19' has an 'Ease_of_Use' score of ""5"".

The only respondent who has the same 'Ease_of_Use' score as respondent '45' (excluding respondent '45' themselves) is respondent '68'.

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
List all respondents who rated 'Integration_of_Functions' the same as respondent '24'.
</task>","To find the respondents who rated 'Integration_of_Functions' the same as respondent '24', we first need to determine how respondent '24' rated 'Integration_of_Functions'. According to the data, respondent '24' rated 'Integration_of_Functions' as ""1"".

Now, we will go through the responses to find all respondents who also rated 'Integration_of_Functions' as ""1"".

From the data provided:
- Respondent ""24"" rated 'Integration_of_Functions' as ""1"".
- Respondent ""84"" did not rate it as ""1"", but as ""4"".
- Respondent ""34"" rated it as ""4"".
- Respondent ""38"" rated it as ""5"".
- Respondent ""88"" rated it as ""4"".
- Respondent ""86"" rated it as ""5"".
- Respondent ""19"" rated it as ""3"".
- Respondent ""29"" rated it as ""4"".
- Respondent ""83"" rated it as ""5"".
- Respondent ""17"" rated it as ""5"".
- Respondent ""30"" rated it as ""5"".

Only respondent ""24"" is listed with a rating of ""1"" for 'Integration_of_Functions'. However, upon reviewing the task again, it seems there might have been an oversight in the initial analysis since no other respondent rated 'Integration_of_Functions' as ""1"" except for respondent ""24"". But, let's correctly identify any other potential matches based on the provided data:

Upon re-examining the data, it's clear that respondent ""24"" is the only one with a rating of ""1"" for 'Integration_of_Functions'. There are no other respondents with this rating.

Therefore, the list of respondents who rated 'Integration_of_Functions' the same as respondent '24' is simply ""24"".",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</task>","To find the respondents who rated 'Cumbersome_to_Use' the same as respondent '47', we first need to determine how respondent '47' rated 'Cumbersome_to_Use'. According to the data, respondent '47' rated 'Cumbersome_to_Use' as ""1"", which means they strongly disagree that the system is cumbersome to use.

Now, we will go through the responses of all other respondents to find those who also rated 'Cumbersome_to_Use' as ""1"".

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents who rated 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' the same as respondent '26'.
</task>","To find the respondents who rated 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' the same as respondent '26', we first need to determine how respondent '26' rated 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use'. According to the data, respondent '26' rated 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' as ""4"".

Now, we will go through the responses to find all respondents who also rated 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' as ""4"".

From the given data:
- Respondent ""24"" rated 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' as ""3"".
- Respondent ""16"" rated 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' as ""1"".
- Respondent ""85"" rated 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' as ""1"".
- Respondent ""58"" rated 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' as ""1"".
- Respondent ""43"" rated 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' as ""1"".
- Respondent ""31"" rated 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' as ""1"".
- Respondent ""26"" rated 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' as ""4"".

Only respondent '26' has a rating of ""4"" for 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use'. Therefore, there are no other respondents who rated 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' the same as respondent '26' except for respondent '26' themselves. However, since the task is to list all respondents who rated the same, and given that '26' is the reference point, the list would technically include '26' as they match their own response. But, considering the context, it seems the task is looking for other respondents who share the same rating. Since there are none, the list of other respondents is empty, but to follow instructions precisely and include '26' as a technical match:

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Find all respondents who gave the same 'Ease_of_Use' score as respondent '38', excluding the respondent themselves.
</task>","To find the respondents who gave the same 'Ease_of_Use' score as respondent '38', we first need to determine the 'Ease_of_Use' score of respondent '38'. According to the data, respondent '38' has an 'Ease_of_Use' score of ""5"".

Next, we need to find all other respondents who also have an 'Ease_of_Use' score of ""5"". 

The respondents with an 'Ease_of_Use' score of ""5"" are: 67, 16, 66, 51, 19, 6, and 38. However, we need to exclude respondent '38' themselves.

Therefore, the respondents who gave the same 'Ease_of_Use' score as respondent '38', excluding respondent '38', are: 67, 16, 66, 51, 19, 6.",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Find all respondents who gave the same 'Ease_of_Use' score as respondent '11', excluding the respondent themselves.
</task>","To find the respondents who gave the same 'Ease_of_Use' score as respondent '11', we first need to determine the 'Ease_of_Use' score of respondent '11'. According to the data, respondent '11' has an 'Ease_of_Use' score of ""5"".

Next, we need to find all other respondents who also have an 'Ease_of_Use' score of ""5"". 

The respondents with an 'Ease_of_Use' score of ""5"" are: 32, 4, 79, 58, 16, 30, and 90.

Therefore, the list of respondents who gave the same 'Ease_of_Use' score as respondent '11', excluding respondent '11' themselves, is: 32, 4, 79, 58, 16, 30, 90.",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents who gave the same 'Ease_of_Use' score as respondent '11', excluding the respondent themselves.
</task>","To find the respondents who gave the same 'Ease_of_Use' score as respondent '11', we first need to determine the 'Ease_of_Use' score of respondent '11'. According to the data, respondent '11' has an 'Ease_of_Use' score of ""5"".

Next, we will go through the responses of all other respondents to find those who also have an 'Ease_of_Use' score of ""5"".

Respondent '38' has an 'Ease_of_Use' score of ""5"".
Respondent '76' has an 'Ease_of_Use' score of ""5"".
Respondent '40' has an 'Ease_of_Use' score of ""5"".
Respondent '49' has an 'Ease_of_Use' score of ""5"".
Respondent '68' does not have an 'Ease_of_Use' score of ""5"", but rather ""4"".
Respondent '46' does not have an 'Ease_of_Use' score of ""5"", but rather ""1"".
Respondent '3' does not have an 'Ease_of_Use' score of ""5"", but rather ""3"".
Respondent '55' does not have an 'Ease_of_Use' score of ""5"", but rather ""2"".

Therefore, the respondents who gave the same 'Ease_of_Use' score as respondent '11' (excluding respondent '11' themselves) are respondents '38', '76', '40', and '49'.

The final answer is: 38, 76, 40, 49",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents are in the same group as respondent '22'?
</task>","To determine which respondents are in the same group as respondent '22', we first need to identify the group of respondent '22'. According to the data, respondent '22' has an answer for the ""Group"" question as ""C"", which corresponds to ""Middle"" based on the schema provided.

Now, we need to find all respondents who also belong to group ""C"" (Middle). Looking through the responses:

- Respondent ""50"" is in group ""C"".
- Respondent ""24"" is in group ""C"".
- Respondent ""22"" is in group ""C"", as already identified.

Therefore, the respondents in the same group as respondent '22' are ""50, 24, 22"".",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents who gave the same 'Ease_of_Use' score as respondent '40', excluding the respondent themselves.
</task>","To find the respondents who gave the same 'Ease_of_Use' score as respondent '40', we first need to determine the 'Ease_of_Use' score of respondent '40'. According to the data, respondent '40' has an 'Ease_of_Use' score of ""5"".

Next, we need to find all other respondents who also have an 'Ease_of_Use' score of ""5"". 

From the data:
- Respondent ""49"" has an 'Ease_of_Use' score of ""5"".
- Respondent ""28"" has an 'Ease_of_Use' score of ""5"".
- Respondent ""2"" has an 'Ease_of_Use' score of ""4"", which does not match.
- Respondent ""82"" has an 'Ease_of_Use' score of ""4"", which does not match.
- Respondent ""61"" has an 'Ease_of_Use' score of ""2"", which does not match.

Therefore, the respondents who gave the same 'Ease_of_Use' score as respondent '40', excluding respondent '40' themselves, are respondents ""49"" and ""28"".

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").

<task>
Find all respondents who gave the same 'Confidence_in_Use' score as respondent '26' and who also strongly agree that the system is easy to learn (score of 5).
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to identify the 'Confidence_in_Use' score of respondent '26' and then find all respondents who have the same score and also have an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 5, indicating they strongly agree that the system is easy to learn.

From the provided data, respondent '26' has a 'Confidence_in_Use' score of ""4"".

Now, we need to find all respondents with a 'Confidence_in_Use' score of ""4"" and an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of ""5"".

Looking through the responses:

- Respondent '26' has 'Confidence_in_Use' = ""4"" and 'Ease_of_Learning' = ""4"", so they do not meet the criteria because their 'Ease_of_Learning' score is not ""5"".
- Respondent '85' has 'Confidence_in_Use' = ""5"" and 'Ease_of_Learning' = ""5"", so they do not meet the criteria because their 'Confidence_in_Use' score is not ""4"".
- Respondent '27' has 'Confidence_in_Use' = ""2"" and 'Ease_of_Learning' = ""2"", so they do not meet the criteria.
- Respondent '56' has 'Confidence_in_Use' = ""5"" and 'Ease_of_Learning' = ""5"", so they do not meet the criteria because their 'Confidence_in_Use' score is not ""4"".
- Respondent '77' has 'Confidence_in_Use' = ""5"" and 'Ease_of_Learning' = ""5"", so they do not meet the criteria because their 'Confidence_in_Use' score is not ""4"".

None of the provided respondents meet the criteria of having a 'Confidence_in_Use' score of ""4"" and an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of ""5"" except for none, as the initial analysis missed the fact that no respondent matches the exact criteria given for both scores. 

Given the strict criteria and upon reevaluation, it's clear the task requires identifying respondents with specific scores, but the provided data does not include a respondent with the exact match of 'Confidence_in_Use' = ""4"" and 'Ease_of_Learning' = ""5"" simultaneously besides respondent '26' themselves for the confidence score, but they don't match the ease of learning score requirement.

Therefore, based on the provided data and the specific question asked, there are no respondents who meet the criteria of having the same 'Confidence_in_Use' score as respondent '26' (which is ""4"") and also having an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of ""5"".

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents who gave the same 'Confidence_in_Use' score as respondent '82' and who also strongly agree that the system is easy to learn (score of 5).
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to identify the 'Confidence_in_Use' score of respondent '82' and then find all respondents who have the same score and also have an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 5, indicating they strongly agree that the system is easy to learn.

From the provided data, respondent '82' has a 'Confidence_in_Use' score of ""4"".

Now, we need to find all respondents with a 'Confidence_in_Use' score of ""4"" and an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of ""5"".

Respondent '17' has a 'Confidence_in_Use' score of ""5"" and an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of ""5"", which does not match.
Respondent '70' has a 'Confidence_in_Use' score of ""5"" and an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of ""5"", which does not match.
Respondent '77' has a 'Confidence_in_Use' score of ""5"" and an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of ""5"", which does not match.
Respondent '23' has a 'Confidence_in_Use' score of ""2"" and an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of ""4"", which does not match.
Respondent '29' has a 'Confidence_in_Use' score of ""4"" and an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of ""5"", which matches.
Respondent '60' has a 'Confidence_in_Use' score of ""4"" and an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of ""4"", which does not match.
Respondent '82' has a 'Confidence_in_Use' score of ""4"" and an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of ""5"", which matches.

Therefore, the respondents who gave the same 'Confidence_in_Use' score as respondent '82' and who also strongly agree that the system is easy to learn are '29' and '82'. 

The final answer is: 29, 82",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

Which respondents are in the same group as respondent '78' and also rated 'System_Complexity' as 5?
</task>","To answer this question, we first need to identify the group of respondent '78' and then find other respondents who are in the same group and rated 'System_Complexity' as 5.

According to the data, respondent '78' is in group ""D"".

Now, let's find other respondents in group ""D"" who rated 'System_Complexity' as 5. However, upon reviewing the data, we see that none of the respondents in group ""D"" rated 'System_Complexity' as 5. In fact, all respondents in group ""D"" rated 'System_Complexity' as 1 or 2.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents who share the same 'Frequent_Usage' score as respondent '6' but are not in the same group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to identify the 'Frequent_Usage' score of respondent '6' and their group. Then, we will find all respondents who have the same 'Frequent_Usage' score but are in a different group.

1. **Identify respondent '6's 'Frequent_Usage' score and group:**
   - Respondent '6' has a 'Frequent_Usage' score of ""5"".
   - Respondent '6' is in group ""A"".

2. **Find all respondents with the same 'Frequent_Usage' score but in a different group:**
   - We will iterate through each respondent's answers and check if their 'Frequent_Usage' score is ""5"" and if they are not in group ""A"".

Let's examine the responses:

- Respondent ""2"" has a 'Frequent_Usage' score of ""4"", which does not match.
- Respondent ""61"" has a 'Frequent_Usage' score of ""1"", which does not match.
- Respondent ""15"" has a 'Frequent_Usage' score of ""2"", which does not match.
- Respondent ""51"" has a 'Frequent_Usage' score of ""4"", which does not match.
- Respondent ""19"" has a 'Frequent_Usage' score of ""1"", which does not match.
- Respondent ""88"" has a 'Frequent_Usage' score of ""2"", which does not match.
- Respondent ""18"" has a 'Frequent_Usage' score of ""3"", which does not match.
- Respondent ""69"" has a 'Frequent_Usage' score of ""3"", which does not match.

None of the provided respondents have a 'Frequent_Usage' score of ""5"" except for respondent ""6"". Therefore, there are no respondents who share the same 'Frequent_Usage' score as respondent '6' but are not in the same group.

The final answer is: $\boxed{69}$",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents who gave the same 'Confidence_in_Use' score as respondent '90' and who also strongly agree that the system is easy to learn (score of 5).
</task>","To find the respondents who meet the specified criteria, we first need to identify the 'Confidence_in_Use' score of respondent '90' and then find all respondents who have the same score and also have an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 5, indicating they strongly agree that the system is easy to learn.

From the provided data, respondent '90' has the following scores:
- 'Confidence_in_Use': 5
- 'Ease_of_Learning': 5

We are looking for respondents with a 'Confidence_in_Use' score of 5 and an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 5.

After examining the responses:
- Respondent '10' has 'Confidence_in_Use': 5 and 'Ease_of_Learning': 5.
- Respondent '28' has 'Confidence_in_Use': 5 and 'Ease_of_Learning': 5.
- Respondent '4' has 'Confidence_in_Use': 5 and 'Ease_of_Learning': 2, which does not meet the criteria.
- Respondent '5' has 'Confidence_in_Use': 5 and 'Ease_of_Learning': 5.
- Respondent '19' has 'Confidence_in_Use': 4, which does not meet the criteria.
- Respondent '39' has 'Confidence_in_Use': 4, which does not meet the criteria.
- Respondent '31' has 'Confidence_in_Use': 1, which does not meet the criteria.
- Respondent '64' has 'Confidence_in_Use': 2, which does not meet the criteria.

Thus, the respondents who gave the same 'Confidence_in_Use' score as respondent '90' (5) and also strongly agree that the system is easy to learn ('Ease_of_Learning' score of 5) are:

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents who share the same 'Ease_of_Learning' score as respondent '84' but are not in the same group.
</task>","To find the respondents who share the same 'Ease_of_Learning' score as respondent '84' but are not in the same group, we first need to identify the 'Ease_of_Learning' score and the group of respondent '84'. 

Respondent '84' has an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of ""2"" and is in group ""D"".

Next, we look for respondents with an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of ""2"" who are not in group ""D"". 

From the provided data, the only respondent with an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of ""2"" aside from '84' is not found, but since '84' is the one with the score of ""2"", we look for others with the same score. There isn't any other respondent with the same 'Ease_of_Learning' score of ""2"". However, we need to correctly follow the format and provide an answer based on the instructions.

Given the specific instructions and the data provided, the correct approach is to identify any respondents with the same 'Ease_of_Learning' score as '84', which is ""2"", and ensure they are not in the same group as '84', which is ""D"". Since there are no other respondents with an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of ""2"", the list of such respondents is empty.

The final answer is: $\boxed{62}$",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents who gave the same 'Confidence_in_Use' score as respondent '40' and who also strongly agree that the system is easy to learn (score of 5).
</task>","To find the respondents who gave the same 'Confidence_in_Use' score as respondent '40' and who also strongly agree that the system is easy to learn (score of 5), we first need to identify the 'Confidence_in_Use' score of respondent '40'. According to the data, respondent '40' has a 'Confidence_in_Use' score of ""5"".

Next, we need to find all respondents who have a 'Confidence_in_Use' score of ""5"" and an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of ""5"". 

From the data provided:
- Respondent ""4"" has 'Confidence_in_Use' = ""5"" and 'Ease_of_Learning' = ""2"", so does not match.
- Respondent ""30"" has 'Confidence_in_Use' = ""5"" and 'Ease_of_Learning' = ""5"", so matches.
- Respondent ""40"" has 'Confidence_in_Use' = ""5"" and 'Ease_of_Learning' = ""5"", so matches.
- Respondent ""47"" has 'Confidence_in_Use' = ""5"" and 'Ease_of_Learning' = ""3"", so does not match.
- Respondent ""13"" has 'Confidence_in_Use' = ""5"" and 'Ease_of_Learning' = ""5"", so matches.

Therefore, the respondents who gave the same 'Confidence_in_Use' score as respondent '40' and who also strongly agree that the system is easy to learn are ""30, 40, 13"".",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents are in the same group as respondent '20' and also rated 'System_Complexity' as 1?
</task>","To determine which respondents are in the same group as respondent '20' and also rated 'System_Complexity' as 1, we first need to identify the group of respondent '20'. According to the data, respondent '20' is in group ""C"".

Next, we need to find all respondents who are also in group ""C"" and rated 'System_Complexity' as 1. 

From the data:
- Respondent '43' is in group ""C"" and rated 'System_Complexity' as 1.
- Respondent '17' is in group ""C"" and rated 'System_Complexity' as 1.
- Respondent '20' is in group ""C"" and rated 'System_Complexity' as 1.
- Respondent '37' is in group ""C"" and rated 'System_Complexity' as 1.
- Respondent '33' is in group ""C"" and rated 'System_Complexity' as 1.
- Respondent '73' is in group ""C"" and rated 'System_Complexity' as 1.

Therefore, the respondents in the same group as respondent '20' and also rated 'System_Complexity' as 1 are: 17, 20, 33, 37, 43, 73.",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents who share the same 'Integration_of_Functions' score as respondent '65' but are not in the same group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to identify the 'Integration_of_Functions' score of respondent '65' and their group. Then, we will find all respondents who have the same 'Integration_of_Functions' score but are in a different group.

From the provided data, respondent '65' has the following information:
- Group: A
- Integration_of_Functions: 2

Now, we need to find all respondents who have an 'Integration_of_Functions' score of 2 but are not in group A.

After examining the data:
- Respondent '3' is in group B and has an 'Integration_of_Functions' score of 2.
- Respondent '65' is the only one in group A with this score, and we are looking for respondents not in group A.

Therefore, the list of respondents who share the same 'Integration_of_Functions' score as respondent '65' but are not in the same group is:

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
List all respondents who share the same 'Integration_of_Functions' score as respondent '88' but are not in the same group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to identify the 'Integration_of_Functions' score of respondent '88' and their group. Then, we will find all respondents who have the same 'Integration_of_Functions' score but are in a different group.

From the provided data, respondent '88' has an 'Integration_of_Functions' score of ""4"" and is in group ""C"".

Now, let's find all respondents who have an 'Integration_of_Functions' score of ""4"" but are not in group ""C"".

Respondent '78' has an 'Integration_of_Functions' score of ""4"" and is in group ""D"".
Respondent '82' has an 'Integration_of_Functions' score of ""4"" and is in group ""C"", so this respondent is in the same group as '88' and should not be included.
Respondent '80' has an 'Integration_of_Functions' score of ""4"" and is in group ""A"".
Respondent '81' has an 'Integration_of_Functions' score of ""4"" and is in group ""A"".

Therefore, the respondents who share the same 'Integration_of_Functions' score as respondent '88' but are not in the same group are '78', '80', and '81'.",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
List all respondents who share the same 'Inconsistency' score as respondent '54' but are not in the same group.
</task>","To solve this task, I will follow the instructions provided.


First, I need to find the 'Inconsistency' score of respondent '54'. According to the data, respondent '54' has an 'Inconsistency' score of ""1"".


Next, I need to find all respondents who share the same 'Inconsistency' score as respondent '54', which is ""1"". The respondents with an 'Inconsistency' score of ""1"" are '82', '54', '55', '14', '47', '48', and '6'.


Then, I need to find the group of respondent '54', which is ""C"" (Middle).


Finally, I need to list all respondents who share the same 'Inconsistency' score as respondent '54' but are not in the same group. The respondents who meet this condition are '55', '14', '47', and '6'.


The corresponding groups for these respondents are:
- '55': A (Senior)
- '14': B (Junior)
- '47': B (Junior)
- '6': A (Senior)


The final answer is: 55,14,47,6",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
List all respondents who share the same 'Ease_of_Learning' score as respondent '50' but are not in the same group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to identify the 'Ease_of_Learning' score of respondent '50' and their group. Then, we will find all respondents who have the same 'Ease_of_Learning' score but are in a different group.

From the provided data, respondent '50' has an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of ""4"" and is in group ""C"".

Now, let's find all respondents with an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of ""4"" who are not in group ""C"":

- Respondent '25' has an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of ""1"", which does not match.
- Respondent '29' has an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of ""5"", which does not match.
- Respondent '34' has an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of ""2"", which does not match.
- Respondent '4' has an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of ""2"", which does not match.
- Respondent '1' has an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of ""5"", which does not match.
- Respondent '51' has an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of ""5"", which does not match.
- Respondent '73' has an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of ""5"", which does not match.
- Respondent '27' has an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of ""2"", which does not match.

However, upon re-examining the data, it appears there was an oversight in the initial analysis. Respondent '50' actually has an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of ""4"". Let's correct the approach:

Respondent '50' is in group ""C"" with an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of ""4"". We need to find respondents with the same 'Ease_of_Learning' score (""4"") but in a different group.

Upon reviewing the data again, we find that none of the respondents except those in group ""C"" have an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of ""4"". The initial task was to identify respondents not in the same group as '50' (group ""C"") but with the same 'Ease_of_Learning' score (""4""). Since '50' is in group ""C"" and has an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of ""4"", and there are no other groups with this score, the correct approach is to identify any respondents with this score not in group ""C"", which upon correct analysis, yields no results directly matching the criteria due to the misunderstanding of the 'Ease_of_Learning' score for respondent '50'.

Given the correct 'Ease_of_Learning' score for respondent '50' is indeed ""4"" and they are in group ""C"", and upon a detailed review, there are actually no respondents outside of group ""C"" with an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of ""4"" that directly matches the task's criteria as initially misinterpreted.

Correcting for the task: Since respondent '50' has an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of ""4"" and is in group ""C"", and the task is to find respondents with the same 'Ease_of_Learning' score (""4"") but not in group ""C"", the actual matching process should focus on the 'Ease_of_Learning' score correctly.

However, the mistake in the analysis was assuming there were matches outside group ""C"" with the same 'Ease_of_Learning' score as '50'. The correct step is to identify any respondent with an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of ""4"" and ensure they are not in group ""C"". 

Given this correction and the actual data provided, there are no respondents outside of group ""C"" with an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of ""4"". The initial premise of finding respondents with the same score but in a different group was based on incorrect analysis.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents who share the same 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score as respondent '5' but are not in the same group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to identify the 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score of respondent '5' and their group. Then, we will find all respondents who have the same 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score but are in a different group.

From the provided data, respondent '5' has the following information:
- Respondent ID: 5
- Group: C
- Need_for_Technical_Support: 1

Now, we need to find all respondents who have a 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score of 1 but are not in group C.

Respondents with 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score of 1:
- 59 (Group A)
- 75 (Group A)
- 5 (Group C) - This is respondent '5' themselves, so we exclude them.
- 32 (Group B)
- 86 (Group A)
- 82 (Group C) - Same group as respondent '5', so we exclude them.
- 17 (Group C) - Same group as respondent '5', so we exclude them.

Respondents with 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score of 1 but not in the same group as respondent '5' (Group C):
- 59 (Group A)
- 75 (Group A)
- 32 (Group B)
- 86 (Group A)

Therefore, the list of respondents who share the same 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score as respondent '5' but are not in the same group is:

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' is higher than the average 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' for the 'Intern' group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' for the 'Intern' group. Then, we compare this average with the 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' of all respondents to find those with a higher value.

1. **Identify 'Intern' Group Respondents**: 
   - From the schema, ""Group"" is defined as ""[MCQ: A. Senior B. Junior C. Middle D. Intern]"". Thus, 'Intern' corresponds to option ""D"".
   - We filter the responses to find those with ""Group"" = ""D"".

2. **Calculate Average 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' for 'Intern' Group**:
   - For each respondent in the 'Intern' group, we note their 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score.
   - We calculate the average of these scores.

3. **Find Respondents with Higher 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' than the Average**:
   - We go through all respondents and compare their 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score with the calculated average for the 'Intern' group.
   - We list the respondents whose score is higher than this average.

**Step 1 & 2: Calculation**

- 'Intern' group respondents are those with ""Group"" = ""D"".
- Relevant respondents are: 49, 30, 74, 71.
- Their 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' scores are: 5, 1, 1, 1.
- Average 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' for 'Intern' group = (5 + 1 + 1 + 1) / 4 = 8 / 4 = 2.

**Step 3: Comparison**

- We compare each respondent's 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score with the average of 2.
- Respondents with a score higher than 2 are: 
  - 49 (score = 5),
  - 43 (score = 1, not higher),
  - 30 (score = 1, not higher),
  - 22 (score = 2, not higher),
  - 50 (score = 1, not higher),
  - 74 (score = 1, not higher),
  - 89 (score = 3, higher),
  - 37 (score = 1, not higher),
  - 71 (score = 1, not higher),
  - 36 (score = 1, not higher).
  
Thus, the respondents with 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' higher than the average for the 'Intern' group are 49 and 89.

The final answer is: $\boxed{49, 89}$",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
List all respondents who share the same 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score as respondent '12' but are not in the same group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to identify the 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score of respondent '12' and their group. Then, we will find all respondents who have the same 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score but are in a different group.

From the provided data, respondent '12' has a 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score of ""2"" and is in group ""D"".

Now, let's find all respondents with a 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score of ""2"" who are not in group ""D"".

Upon examining the data, we find that respondent '12' is the only one with a 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score of ""2"". There are no other respondents with this score.

Therefore, there are no respondents who share the same 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score as respondent '12' but are not in the same group.",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents are in a group where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score for that same group?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'System_Complexity' and 'Ease_of_Use' scores for each group. Then, we identify the groups where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score. Finally, we list the respondents who belong to those groups.

Given the data, let's calculate the averages for each group:

1. **Group A**:
   - Respondents: 86, 13, 59
   - System_Complexity scores: 5, 1, 1
   - Ease_of_Use scores: 1, 5, 5
   - Average System_Complexity: (5 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 7 / 3 = 2.33
   - Average Ease_of_Use: (1 + 5 + 5) / 3 = 11 / 3 = 3.67
   - Since 2.33 < 3.67, Group A does not meet the criteria.

2. **Group C**:
   - Respondents: 5, 37, 19
   - System_Complexity scores: 1, 1, 1
   - Ease_of_Use scores: 5, 5, 5
   - Average System_Complexity: (1 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 3 / 3 = 1
   - Average Ease_of_Use: (5 + 5 + 5) / 3 = 15 / 3 = 5
   - Since 1 < 5, Group C does not meet the criteria.

3. **Group D**:
   - Respondents: 90, 60, 48, 77, 64, 78
   - System_Complexity scores: 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1
   - Ease_of_Use scores: 5, 5, 5, 5, 2, 3
   - Average System_Complexity: (1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 1) / 6 = 8 / 6 = 1.33
   - Average Ease_of_Use: (5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 2 + 3) / 6 = 25 / 6 = 4.17
   - Since 1.33 < 4.17, Group D does not meet the criteria.

Upon reviewing the calculations, it appears there was an oversight in the interpretation of the results. Given the corrected understanding of the task, we should be looking for groups where the average 'System_Complexity' score exceeds the average 'Ease_of_Use' score. However, based on the calculations provided:

- None of the groups (A, C, D) have an average 'System_Complexity' score higher than their average 'Ease_of_Use' score.

Thus, the correct answer, based on the provided data and calculations, is that there are no respondents in a group where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score for that same group. 

The final answer is: $\boxed{86}$",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'Inconsistency' is higher than the average 'Inconsistency' for the 'Junior' group.
</task>","To find the respondents whose 'Inconsistency' is higher than the average 'Inconsistency' for the 'Junior' group, we first need to identify the respondents in the 'Junior' group, calculate the average 'Inconsistency' for this group, and then compare this average with the 'Inconsistency' scores of all respondents to find those with higher scores.

1. **Identify 'Junior' Group Respondents**: The 'Junior' group corresponds to the answer code ""B"" in the 'Group' question.

2. **Calculate Average 'Inconsistency' for 'Junior' Group**:
   - Respondent ""23"" is in the 'Junior' group with an 'Inconsistency' score of ""2"".
   - There are no other respondents in the 'Junior' group.
   - The average 'Inconsistency' for the 'Junior' group is 2.

3. **Find Respondents with Higher 'Inconsistency'**:
   - We need to find respondents with an 'Inconsistency' score higher than 2.
   - Respondent ""90"" has an 'Inconsistency' score of ""2"", which is not higher than the average.
   - Respondent ""49"" has an 'Inconsistency' score of ""4"", which is higher than the average.
   - Respondent ""15"" has an 'Inconsistency' score of ""1"", which is not higher than the average.
   - Respondents ""53"", ""67"", ""70"", and ""29"" all have an 'Inconsistency' score of ""1"", which is not higher than the average.

Therefore, the respondents with an 'Inconsistency' score higher than the average for the 'Junior' group are:

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondents are in a group where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score for that same group?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'System_Complexity' and 'Ease_of_Use' scores for each group, and then identify the groups where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score. Finally, we will list the respondents who belong to those groups.

Given the data, let's calculate the averages for each group:

1. **Group A**:
   - Respondents: 35, 11
   - System_Complexity scores: 5, 1
   - Ease_of_Use scores: 1, 5
   - Average System_Complexity: (5 + 1) / 2 = 3
   - Average Ease_of_Use: (1 + 5) / 2 = 3

2. **Group B**:
   - Respondents: 44, 3
   - System_Complexity scores: 2, 1
   - Ease_of_Use scores: 5, 3
   - Average System_Complexity: (2 + 1) / 2 = 1.5
   - Average Ease_of_Use: (5 + 3) / 2 = 4

3. **Group C**:
   - Respondents: 54, 63, 33, 39, 62
   - System_Complexity scores: 1, 1, 1, 4, 1
   - Ease_of_Use scores: 5, 5, 5, 1, 5
   - Average System_Complexity: (1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1) / 5 = 1.6
   - Average Ease_of_Use: (5 + 5 + 5 + 1 + 5) / 5 = 4.2

4. **Group D**:
   - Respondent: 10
   - System_Complexity score: 1
   - Ease_of_Use score: 4
   - Average System_Complexity: 1
   - Average Ease_of_Use: 4

Comparing the averages:
- Group A: System_Complexity = Ease_of_Use, so it doesn't meet the criteria.
- Group B: System_Complexity < Ease_of_Use, so it doesn't meet the criteria.
- Group C: System_Complexity < Ease_of_Use, so it doesn't meet the criteria.
- Group D: System_Complexity < Ease_of_Use, so it doesn't meet the criteria.

However, upon reviewing the initial assessment, it appears there was an oversight in identifying groups where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score, as none of the groups directly meet this criterion based on the calculations provided. 

Given the correct calculations and comparisons, the actual task is to identify respondents in groups where the condition is met, but based on the provided data and calculations, no group meets the condition where the average 'System_Complexity' score exceeds the average 'Ease_of_Use' score. 

Thus, the correct answer, based on the provided data and the specific question asked, should reflect that no respondents are in a group where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score, as none of the calculated averages for 'System_Complexity' are greater than those for 'Ease_of_Use' in their respective groups.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents whose total positive usability score ('Ease_of_Use' + 'Integration_of_Functions') is lower than the average for all respondents in the 'Senior' group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average total positive usability score for the 'Senior' group, and then identify all respondents whose score falls below this average.

1. **Identify 'Senior' Group Respondents and Their Scores:**
   - From the schema, 'Group' is defined as ""[MCQ: A. Senior B. Junior C. Middle D. Intern]"".
   - Thus, respondents in the 'Senior' group are those with ""Group"" = ""A"".

2. **Calculate Total Positive Usability Score for Each 'Senior' Respondent:**
   - This score is the sum of 'Ease_of_Use' and 'Integration_of_Functions' for each respondent.

3. **Calculate the Average Total Positive Usability Score for the 'Senior' Group:**
   - Sum all the total positive usability scores of 'Senior' respondents and divide by the number of 'Senior' respondents.

4. **Identify Respondents with Scores Lower Than the 'Senior' Group Average:**
   - Calculate the total positive usability score for each respondent.
   - Compare each respondent's score to the average score of the 'Senior' group.

**Step 1 & 2: Identify 'Senior' Respondents and Calculate Their Scores**

- Respondent ""6"" (Score: 4 + 5 = 9)
- Respondent ""76"" (Score: 5 + 4 = 9)
- Respondent ""67"" (Score: 5 + 5 = 10)

**Step 3: Calculate the Average Score for 'Senior' Respondents**

Average = (8 + 9 + 9 + 10) / 4 = 36 / 4 = 9

**Step 4: Identify All Respondents with Scores Lower Than the Average**

- Respondent ""10"" (Score: 4 + 5 = 9) -> Equal to average, not lower
- Respondent ""52"" (Score: 8) -> Lower than average
- Respondent ""6"" (Score: 9) -> Equal to average, not lower
- Respondent ""76"" (Score: 9) -> Equal to average, not lower
- Respondent ""30"" (Score: 5 + 5 = 10) -> Higher than average
- Respondent ""82"" (Score: 4 + 4 = 8) -> Lower than average
- Respondent ""67"" (Score: 10) -> Higher than average
- Respondent ""20"" (Score: 5 + 4 = 9) -> Equal to average, not lower

Respondents with scores lower than the 'Senior' group average are ""52"" and ""82"".

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondents are in a group where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score for that same group?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'System_Complexity' and 'Ease_of_Use' scores for each group. Then, we identify the groups where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score. Finally, we list the respondents that belong to those groups.

Let's calculate the averages for each group:

1. Group A:
   - Respondents: 46, 56, 59
   - System_Complexity scores: 1, 2, 1
   - Ease_of_Use scores: 1, 4, 5
   - Average System_Complexity: (1 + 2 + 1) / 3 = 4 / 3 = 1.33
   - Average Ease_of_Use: (1 + 4 + 5) / 3 = 10 / 3 = 3.33
   - Since 1.33 < 3.33, Group A does not meet the criteria.

2. Group B:
   - Respondents: 44, 66, 79
   - System_Complexity scores: 2, 1, 1
   - Ease_of_Use scores: 5, 5, 5
   - Average System_Complexity: (2 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 4 / 3 = 1.33
   - Average Ease_of_Use: (5 + 5 + 5) / 3 = 15 / 3 = 5
   - Since 1.33 < 5, Group B does not meet the criteria.

3. Group C:
   - Respondents: 9, 33, 50, 51
   - System_Complexity scores: 3, 1, 1, 1
   - Ease_of_Use scores: 1, 5, 5, 5
   - Average System_Complexity: (3 + 1 + 1 + 1) / 4 = 6 / 4 = 1.5
   - Average Ease_of_Use: (1 + 5 + 5 + 5) / 4 = 16 / 4 = 4
   - Since 1.5 < 4, Group C does not meet the criteria.

4. Group D:
   - Respondents: 71, 74
   - System_Complexity scores: 1, 1
   - Ease_of_Use scores: 5, 5
   - Average System_Complexity: (1 + 1) / 2 = 2 / 2 = 1
   - Average Ease_of_Use: (5 + 5) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5
   - Since 1 < 5, Group D does not meet the criteria.

However, upon reviewing the calculations, it appears there was an oversight in the interpretation of the results. Let's correct the approach by directly comparing the averages calculated for each group and identifying any group where the average 'System_Complexity' score exceeds the average 'Ease_of_Use' score, which upon the initial review, seems to have been misinterpreted due to a miscalculation or misunderstanding of the task's requirements.

Given the correct approach and upon reevaluation:
- None of the groups have an average 'System_Complexity' score higher than their average 'Ease_of_Use' score based on the initial calculations provided.

Thus, the correct answer, based on the provided calculations and the task's specific request for respondents in groups where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score, would reflect an accurate interpretation of the data provided and the calculations performed.

Given the nature of the task and the calculations:

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents whose total positive usability score ('Ease_of_Use' + 'Integration_of_Functions') is lower than the average for all respondents in the 'Senior' group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average total positive usability score for the 'Senior' group, and then identify all respondents whose score is lower than this average.

1. **Identify 'Senior' Group Respondents and Their Scores:**
   - From the 'questions' section, we understand 'Group' is an MCQ with A. Senior, B. Junior, C. Middle, D. Intern.
   - We look for respondents with 'Group': 'A' in the 'responses' section.
   - Relevant respondents are ""72"" and ""65"".

2. **Calculate Total Positive Usability Score for Each 'Senior' Respondent:**
   - For respondent ""72"": 'Ease_of_Use' is 5 and 'Integration_of_Functions' is 5. Total score = 5 + 5 = 10.
   - For respondent ""65"": 'Ease_of_Use' is 5 and 'Integration_of_Functions' is 2. Total score = 5 + 2 = 7.

3. **Calculate the Average Total Positive Usability Score for the 'Senior' Group:**
   - Average = (10 + 7) / 2 = 17 / 2 = 8.5.

4. **Identify All Respondents and Their Total Positive Usability Scores:**
   - We calculate 'Ease_of_Use' + 'Integration_of_Functions' for each respondent.
   - Respondent ""71"": 5 + 4 = 9.
   - Respondent ""41"": 5 + 5 = 10.
   - Respondent ""17"": 5 + 5 = 10.
   - Respondent ""72"": Already calculated as 10.
   - Respondent ""69"": 5 + 5 = 10.
   - Respondent ""39"": 1 + 5 = 6.
   - Respondent ""65"": Already calculated as 7.
   - Respondent ""25"": 3 + 3 = 6.

5. **List Respondents with Scores Lower Than the 'Senior' Group Average (8.5):**
   - Respondents with scores lower than 8.5 are ""71"" (score 9), ""39"" (score 6), ""65"" (score 7), and ""25"" (score 6).

The final answer is: $\boxed{71, 39, 65, 25}$",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents are in a group where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score for that same group?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'System_Complexity' and 'Ease_of_Use' scores for each group. Then, we identify the groups where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score. Finally, we list the respondents who belong to those groups.

Given data:

- Group A respondents: 42, 6
- Group B respondents: 66, 36
- Group C respondents: 9, 53, 88
- Group D respondents: 45, 15, 71, 7

Calculating averages for each group:

### Group A
- System_Complexity: (1 + 1) / 2 = 1
- Ease_of_Use: (5 + 4) / 2 = 4.5

### Group B
- System_Complexity: (1 + 1) / 2 = 1
- Ease_of_Use: (5 + 5) / 2 = 5

### Group C
- System_Complexity: (3 + 1 + 2) / 3 = 2
- Ease_of_Use: (1 + 5 + 5) / 3 = 3.67

### Group D
- System_Complexity: (1 + 2 + 1 + 1) / 4 = 1.25
- Ease_of_Use: (4 + 4 + 5 + 5) / 4 = 4.5

Comparing averages:

- Group A: System_Complexity (1) < Ease_of_Use (4.5)
- Group B: System_Complexity (1) < Ease_of_Use (5)
- Group C: System_Complexity (2) < Ease_of_Use (3.67)
- Group D: System_Complexity (1.25) < Ease_of_Use (4.5)

It appears there was an oversight in the initial comparison for Group C, given the calculated averages do indeed show that the System_Complexity is less than the Ease_of_Use for all groups. However, upon reevaluation, it's clear that none of the groups have a higher average 'System_Complexity' score than 'Ease_of_Use' score based on the provided calculations.

Given this correction, the task's specific condition (average 'System_Complexity' score higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score) is not met by any group. Therefore, there are no respondents to list who meet the specified criteria.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9, 88}$",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'Inconsistency' is higher than the average 'Inconsistency' for the 'Middle' group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Inconsistency' for the 'Middle' group. Then, we compare each respondent's 'Inconsistency' score to this average, identifying those with higher scores.

1. **Identify respondents in the 'Middle' group:**
   - From the data, respondents in the 'Middle' group have ""Group"": ""C"".

2. **Calculate the average 'Inconsistency' for the 'Middle' group:**
   - Respondents with ""Group"": ""C"" are ""82"" and ""43"".
   - Their 'Inconsistency' scores are 1 and 1, respectively.
   - Average 'Inconsistency' = (1 + 1) / 2 = 1.

3. **Find all respondents with 'Inconsistency' higher than the average for the 'Middle' group (which is 1):**
   - We go through each respondent's data and check their 'Inconsistency' score.
   - Respondents with 'Inconsistency' > 1 are:
     - ""64"" with 'Inconsistency' = 4,
     - ""35"" with 'Inconsistency' = 5,
     - ""61"" with 'Inconsistency' = 4,
     - ""89"" with 'Inconsistency' = 3.

Therefore, the respondents whose 'Inconsistency' is higher than the average 'Inconsistency' for the 'Middle' group are 64, 35, 61, 89.",False
