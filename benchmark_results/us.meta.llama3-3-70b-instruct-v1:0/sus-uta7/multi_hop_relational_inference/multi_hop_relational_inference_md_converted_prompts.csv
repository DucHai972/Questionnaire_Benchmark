<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

Therefore, the respondents in the same group as respondent '25' are respondents 30, 48, 49, and 25 itself. However, since the question asks for respondents other than '25' who are in the same group, we exclude '25' from the list.

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Find all respondents who gave the same 'Confidence_in_Use' score as respondent '26' and who also strongly agree that the system is easy to learn (score of 5).
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to identify the 'Confidence_in_Use' score of respondent '26' and then find all respondents who have the same score and also have an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 5, indicating they strongly agree that the system is easy to learn.

From the provided data:
- Respondent 26 has a 'Confidence_in_Use' score of 4.
- The 'Ease_of_Learning' question is about how quickly most people would learn to use the system, with a score of 5 indicating strong agreement that the system is easy to learn.

Now, let's examine each respondent's data to find matches:

### Respondent 26
- **Confidence_in_Use:** 4
- **Ease_of_Learning:** 4 (Does not match the criteria of having an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 5)

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents who gave the same 'Confidence_in_Use' score as respondent '82' and who also strongly agree that the system is easy to learn (score of 5).
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to identify the 'Confidence_in_Use' score of respondent '82' and then find all respondents who have the same score and also have an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 5, indicating they strongly agree that the system is easy to learn.

From the provided data, respondent '82' has a 'Confidence_in_Use' score of 4.

Now, we will go through the responses to find all respondents with a 'Confidence_in_Use' score of 4 and an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 5.

- Respondent 15: 'Confidence_in_Use' is 4, but 'Ease_of_Learning' is 4, not 5.
- Respondent 17: 'Confidence_in_Use' is 5, not 4.
- Respondent 70: 'Confidence_in_Use' is 5, not 4.
- Respondent 77: 'Confidence_in_Use' is 5, not 4.
- Respondent 23: 'Confidence_in_Use' is 2, not 4.
- Respondent 29: 'Confidence_in_Use' is 4, and 'Ease_of_Learning' is 5. This respondent matches the criteria.
- Respondent 82: This is the reference respondent, so we are looking for others like this one, but 'Ease_of_Learning' is 5, which matches, and 'Confidence_in_Use' is 4, which is what we're looking for in others.
- Respondent 60: 'Confidence_in_Use' is 4, but 'Ease_of_Learning' is 4, not 5.

The respondents who gave the same 'Confidence_in_Use' score as respondent '82' (which is 4) and also strongly agree that the system is easy to learn (score of 5 for 'Ease_of_Learning') are:

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents who share the same 'Frequent_Usage' score as respondent '6' but are not in the same group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to identify the 'Frequent_Usage' score of respondent '6' and their group. Then, we will list all respondents who have the same 'Frequent_Usage' score but are in a different group.

Respondent '6' has a 'Frequent_Usage' score of 5 and is in group 'A'.

Now, let's find all respondents with a 'Frequent_Usage' score of 5 but are not in group 'A'.

- Respondent 51 has a 'Frequent_Usage' score of 4, which does not match.
- Respondent 19 has a 'Frequent_Usage' score of 1, which does not match.
- Respondent 88 has a 'Frequent_Usage' score of 2, which does not match.
- Respondent 69 has a 'Frequent_Usage' score of 3, which does not match.
- Respondent 61 has a 'Frequent_Usage' score of 1, which does not match.
- Respondent 15 has a 'Frequent_Usage' score of 2, which does not match.
- Respondent 2 has a 'Frequent_Usage' score of 4, which does not match.
- Respondent 18 has a 'Frequent_Usage' score of 3, which does not match.

However, upon reviewing the provided data again for accuracy:

- Respondent 51 has a 'Frequent_Usage' score of 4.
- Respondent 19 has a 'Frequent_Usage' score of 1.
- Respondent 88 has a 'Frequent_Usage' score of 2.
- Respondent 69 has a 'Frequent_Usage' score of 3.
- Respondent 61 has a 'Frequent_Usage' score of 1.
- Respondent 15 has a 'Frequent_Usage' score of 2.
- Respondent 2 has a 'Frequent_Usage' score of 4.
- Respondent 18 has a 'Frequent_Usage' score of 3.
- Respondent 6 has a 'Frequent_Usage' score of 5 and is in group A.
- We are missing the data for respondent 9 and other potential respondents who could match the 'Frequent_Usage' score of 5.

Given the data provided and focusing on the task:

The only respondent with a 'Frequent_Usage' score of 5 mentioned is Respondent 6 (in group A) and Respondent 51 does not match because their score is 4, but Respondent 69 and Respondent 19 do not match either because their scores are 3 and 1 respectively. However, we notice that Respondent 51 and Respondent 19 are in group C, and Respondent 69 is in group B, and none of these have a 'Frequent_Usage' score of 5 except for one more:

Respondent 51 is in group C and has a 'Frequent_Usage' score of 4, not 5. 
Respondent 19 is in group C and has a 'Frequent_Usage' score of 1, not 5.
Respondent 88 is in group C and has a 'Frequent_Usage' score of 2, not 5.
Respondent 69 is in group B and has a 'Frequent_Usage' score of 3, not 5.

Actually, the correct match for 'Frequent_Usage' score of 5 (like Respondent 6) from the given data is not found among the provided respondents except for one potential match which was overlooked due to the focus on the initial list:

Respondent 6 is in group A with a 'Frequent_Usage' score of 5.
Another respondent with a 'Frequent_Usage' score of 5 is needed but not directly listed in the comparison.

Upon re-evaluation for accuracy in following the format and providing a precise answer based on the given data and the specific question asked:

The question asks for respondents who share the same 'Frequent_Usage' score as respondent '6' (which is 5) but are not in the same group as respondent '6' (group A). 

Given the data and focusing strictly on the 'Frequent_Usage' score of 5 and not being in group A:

- Respondent 69 is in group B and has a 'Frequent_Usage' score of 3, not 5.
- Respondent 51 is in group C and has a 'Frequent_Usage' score of 4, not 5.
- Respondent 19 is in group C and has a 'Frequent_Usage' score of 1, not 5.
- Respondent 88 is in group C and has a 'Frequent_Usage' score of 2, not 5.

But, there's an important point missed in the initial analysis due to the structure of the question and the data provided. The actual task requires identifying respondents with the same 'Frequent_Usage' score as respondent 6 (score of 5) and not in the same group as respondent 6 (group A). 

Given this, and correcting the approach to directly answer the question based on the data provided and the specific criteria:

We need to find respondents with a 'Frequent_Usage' score of 5 who are not in group A. 

From the data provided:
- Respondent 6 has a 'Frequent_Usage' score of 5 and is in group A.
- Another respondent with a 'Frequent_Usage' score of 5 is Respondent 51, no, they have a score of 4.
- Actually, the data provided does not directly offer another respondent with a 'Frequent_Usage' score of 5 outside of group A based on the initial list provided.

However, the correct step involves directly identifying any respondent with a 'Frequent_Usage' score of 5 not in group A, which upon a detailed review, includes considering all provided data points for an accurate match.

The final answer is: $\boxed{69}$",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents who share the same 'Ease_of_Learning' score as respondent '84' but are not in the same group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to identify the 'Ease_of_Learning' score of respondent '84' and their group. Then, we will list all respondents who have the same 'Ease_of_Learning' score but are in a different group.

Respondent '84' has an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 2 and is in group D.

Now, let's examine each respondent's 'Ease_of_Learning' score and group:

- Respondent 74: 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 5, group D.
- Respondent 22: 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 4, group C.
- Respondent 81: 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 5, group A.
- Respondent 30: 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 5, group D.
- Respondent 36: 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 5, group B.
- Respondent 62: 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 1, group C.
- Respondent 69: 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 5, group B.

None of the listed respondents have an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 2 except for respondent '84'. However, since the task asks for respondents who share the same 'Ease_of_Learning' score as respondent '84' but are not in the same group, and there are no other respondents with an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 2, the list of such respondents is empty.

Therefore, the answer is: there are no respondents who meet the specified criteria.",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents who gave the same 'Confidence_in_Use' score as respondent '40' and who also strongly agree that the system is easy to learn (score of 5).
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to identify the 'Confidence_in_Use' score of respondent '40' and then find all respondents who have the same score and also have an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 5, indicating they strongly agree that the system is easy to learn.

From the data provided:

- Respondent 40 has a 'Confidence_in_Use' score of 5.
- The 'Ease_of_Learning' question is about how quickly most people would learn to use the system, with a score of 5 indicating strong agreement that the system is easy to learn.

Now, let's identify respondents who match both criteria:

1. **Respondent 40** themselves have a 'Confidence_in_Use' score of 5 and an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 5, so they match.
2. **Respondent 4** has a 'Confidence_in_Use' score of 5 but an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 2, so they do not match.
3. **Respondent 13** has a 'Confidence_in_Use' score of 5 and an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 5, so they match.
4. **Respondent 30** has a 'Confidence_in_Use' score of 5 and an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 5, so they match.
5. **Respondent 47** has a 'Confidence_in_Use' score of 5 but an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 3, so they do not match.
6. **Respondent 50** has a 'Confidence_in_Use' score of 4, so they do not match.
7. **Respondent 55** has a 'Confidence_in_Use' score of 2, so they do not match.
8. **Respondent 68** has a 'Confidence_in_Use' score of 4, so they do not match.
9. **Respondent 75** has a 'Confidence_in_Use' score of 4, so they do not match.
10. **Respondent 9** has a 'Confidence_in_Use' score of 2, so they do not match.
11. **Respondent 44** has a 'Confidence_in_Use' score of 1, so they do not match.
12. **Respondent 46** has a 'Confidence_in_Use' score of 3, so they do not match.

The matching respondents are 40, 13, and 30. 

The final answer is: $\boxed{40, 13, 30}$",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents are in the same group as respondent '20' and also rated 'System_Complexity' as 1?
</task>","To answer this question, we first need to identify the group of respondent '20' and then find other respondents who are in the same group and rated 'System_Complexity' as 1.

According to the data, respondent '20' is in group 'C'. 

Now, let's find other respondents in group 'C' who rated 'System_Complexity' as 1:

- Respondent 43: Group 'C', System_Complexity = 1

- Respondent 37: Group 'C', System_Complexity = 1
- Respondent 33: Group 'C', System_Complexity = 1
- Respondent 73: Group 'C', System_Complexity = 1

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents who share the same 'Inconsistency' score as respondent '54' but are not in the same group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to identify the 'Inconsistency' score of respondent '54' and their group. Then, we will list all respondents who have the same 'Inconsistency' score but are in a different group.


Respondent '54' has an 'Inconsistency' score of 1 and is in group 'C'.


Now, let's find all respondents with an 'Inconsistency' score of 1 who are not in group 'C'.


- Respondent 82: Inconsistency score = 1, Group = C (same group, exclude)
- Respondent 54: Already identified (same respondent, exclude)
- Respondent 55: Inconsistency score = 1, Group = A (different group, include)
- Respondent 14: Inconsistency score = 1, Group = B (different group, include)
- Respondent 9: Inconsistency score = 5, Group = C (different score, exclude)
- Respondent 47: Inconsistency score = 1, Group = B (different group, include)
- Respondent 90: Inconsistency score = 2, Group = D (different score, exclude)
- Respondent 60: Inconsistency score = 2, Group = D (different score, exclude)
- Respondent 48: Inconsistency score = 1, Group = D (different group, include)
- Respondent 6: Inconsistency score = 1, Group = A (different group, include)
- Respondent 78: Inconsistency score = 4, Group = D (different score, exclude)


The respondents with the same 'Inconsistency' score as respondent '54' (score = 1) but are not in the same group ('C') are:

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents who share the same 'Ease_of_Learning' score as respondent '50' but are not in the same group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to identify the 'Ease_of_Learning' score of respondent '50' and their group. Then, we will list all respondents who have the same 'Ease_of_Learning' score but are in a different group.

From the provided data:
- Respondent 50 has an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 4 and is in group C.

Now, let's find respondents with the same 'Ease_of_Learning' score (4) but in a different group:

- Respondent 25 has an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 1, which does not match.
- Respondent 27 has an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 2, which does not match.
- Respondent 29 has an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 5, which does not match.
- Respondent 34 has an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 2, which does not match.
- Respondent 4 has an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 2, which does not match.
- Respondent 51 has an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 5, which does not match.
- Respondent 73 has an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 5, which does not match.
- Respondent 1 has an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 5, which does not match.

Actually, upon reviewing the data again for accuracy in following the instructions:
- Respondent 50 has an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 4 and is in group C.
- We need to find respondents with the 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 4 who are not in group C.

Upon re-examination:
- Respondent 25 has an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 1, which does not match.
- Respondent 27 has an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 2, which does not match.
- Respondent 29 has an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 5, which does not match.
- Respondent 34 has an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 2, which does not match.
- Respondent 4 has an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 2, which does not match.
- Respondent 51 has an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 5, which does not match.
- Respondent 73 has an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 5, which does not match.
- Respondent 1 has an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 5, which does not match.

It seems there was an oversight in the initial analysis. Given the correct 'Ease_of_Learning' score for respondent 50 is actually 4, and upon reviewing the data provided, there are no other respondents with an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 4 who are not in group C, because none of the other groups have a respondent with this exact score. 

Thus, the correct answer, following the precise format and instructions given, should reflect that there are no respondents who match the criteria of having the same 'Ease_of_Learning' score as respondent 50 (which is 4) and are in a different group, as all other respondents either do not have the score of 4 or are in the same group C. 

The final answer is: $\boxed{25, 27, 29, 34, 4, 51, 73, 1}$",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents who share the same 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score as respondent '5' but are not in the same group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to identify the 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score of respondent '5' and their group. Then, we will list all respondents who have the same 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score but are in a different group.

Respondent '5' has a 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score of 1 and is in group C.

Now, let's find all respondents with a 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score of 1 but are not in group C:

- Respondent 59: Group A, 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score of 1
- Respondent 75: Group A, 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score of 1
- Respondent 32: Group B, 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score of 1
- Respondent 68: Group B, 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score of 4 (does not match)
- Respondent 82: Group C, 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score of 1 (same group as respondent 5, so not included)
- Respondent 27: Group C, 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score of 4 (does not match)

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' is higher than the average 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' for the 'Intern' group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' for the 'Intern' group. Then, we compare this average with the 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' of each respondent to find those with a higher value.

1. **Identify 'Intern' Group Respondents**: 
   - Respondent 49: Group D (Intern), Need_to_Learn_Before_Use: 5
   - Respondent 30: Group D (Intern), Need_to_Learn_Before_Use: 1
   - Respondent 74: Group D (Intern), Need_to_Learn_Before_Use: 1
   - Respondent 71: Group D (Intern), Need_to_Learn_Before_Use: 1

2. **Calculate Average 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' for 'Intern' Group**:
   - Average = (5 + 1 + 1 + 1) / 4 = 8 / 4 = 2

3. **Find Respondents with 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' Higher than the Average**:
   - We look for respondents with Need_to_Learn_Before_Use > 2.
   - Respondent 49: Need_to_Learn_Before_Use: 5 (Higher than average)
   - Respondent 22: Need_to_Learn_Before_Use: 2 (Not higher than average)
   - Respondent 89: Need_to_Learn_Before_Use: 3 (Higher than average)

4. **List Respondents with 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' Higher than the Average for 'Intern' Group**:
   - Respondent 49, Respondent 89

Therefore, the respondents whose 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' is higher than the average 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' for the 'Intern' group are Respondent 49 and Respondent 89.",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents are in a group where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score for that same group?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'System_Complexity' and 'Ease_of_Use' scores for each group, and then identify the groups where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score. Finally, we will list the respondents that belong to those groups.

Let's calculate the averages for each group based on the provided responses:

### Group A
- Respondent 86: System_Complexity = 5, Ease_of_Use = 1
- Respondent 13: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
- Respondent 59: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5

Average System_Complexity for Group A = (5 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 7 / 3 = 2.33
Average Ease_of_Use for Group A = (1 + 5 + 5) / 3 = 11 / 3 = 3.67

### Group B
There are no respondents in Group B.

### Group C
- Respondent 5: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
- Respondent 37: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
- Respondent 19: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5

Average System_Complexity for Group C = (1 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 3 / 3 = 1
Average Ease_of_Use for Group C = (5 + 5 + 5) / 3 = 15 / 3 = 5

### Group D
- Respondent 90: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
- Respondent 60: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
- Respondent 48: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
- Respondent 77: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
- Respondent 64: System_Complexity = 3, Ease_of_Use = 2
- Respondent 78: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 3

Average System_Complexity for Group D = (1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 1) / 6 = 8 / 6 = 1.33
Average Ease_of_Use for Group D = (5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 2 + 3) / 6 = 25 / 6 = 4.17

From the calculations, only Group A has an average 'System_Complexity' score (2.33) that is not higher than its average 'Ease_of_Use' score (3.67). However, upon reevaluation, it's clear that the initial interpretation was incorrect: we are looking for groups where the average 'System_Complexity' is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use', which does not occur in any of the groups based on the provided calculations. 

Given the correct understanding of the task, we should identify respondents in groups where the condition is met, but since none of the groups have a higher average 'System_Complexity' than 'Ease_of_Use', the correct approach is to state that there are no respondents that meet the specified condition based on the provided data and calculations.

The final answer is: $\boxed{86}$",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'Inconsistency' is higher than the average 'Inconsistency' for the 'Junior' group.
</task>","To find the respondents whose 'Inconsistency' is higher than the average 'Inconsistency' for the 'Junior' group, we first need to calculate the average 'Inconsistency' for the 'Junior' group.

From the provided data, the 'Junior' group corresponds to option B. Let's find the respondents in the 'Junior' group and their 'Inconsistency' scores:

- Respondent 23: **Group:** B, **Inconsistency:** 2

Since there is only one respondent in the 'Junior' group, the average 'Inconsistency' for this group is 2.

Now, let's identify all respondents whose 'Inconsistency' is higher than this average (2):

- Respondent 90: **Inconsistency:** 2 (Equal to the average, not higher)
- Respondent 49: **Inconsistency:** 4 (Higher than the average)
- Respondent 15: **Inconsistency:** 1 (Lower than the average)
- Respondent 23: **Inconsistency:** 2 (This is the Junior group respondent, used for calculating the average)
- Respondent 53: **Inconsistency:** 1 (Lower than the average)
- Respondent 67: **Inconsistency:** 1 (Lower than the average)
- Respondent 70: **Inconsistency:** 1 (Lower than the average)
- Respondent 29: **Inconsistency:** 1 (Lower than the average)

Only Respondent 49 has an 'Inconsistency' score higher than the average 'Inconsistency' of the 'Junior' group.

The final answer is: $\boxed{49}$",True

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondents are in a group where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score for that same group?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'System_Complexity' and 'Ease_of_Use' scores for each group. Then, we identify the groups where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score. Finally, we list the respondents that belong to those groups.

Let's calculate the averages for each group based on the provided responses:

### Group A
- Respondent 35: System_Complexity = 5, Ease_of_Use = 1
- Respondent 11: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
- Average System_Complexity = (5 + 1) / 2 = 3
- Average Ease_of_Use = (1 + 5) / 2 = 3

### Group B
- Respondent 44: System_Complexity = 2, Ease_of_Use = 5
- Respondent 3: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 3
- Average System_Complexity = (2 + 1) / 2 = 1.5
- Average Ease_of_Use = (5 + 3) / 2 = 4

### Group C
- Respondent 54: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
- Respondent 63: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
- Respondent 33: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
- Respondent 39: System_Complexity = 4, Ease_of_Use = 1
- Respondent 62: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
- Average System_Complexity = (1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1) / 5 = 1.6
- Average Ease_of_Use = (5 + 5 + 5 + 1 + 5) / 5 = 4.2

### Group D
- Respondent 10: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 4
- Average System_Complexity = 1
- Average Ease_of_Use = 4

Now, comparing the averages for each group:
- Group A: Average System_Complexity = Average Ease_of_Use, so it does not meet the criteria.
- Group B: Average System_Complexity < Average Ease_of_Use, so it does not meet the criteria.
- Group C: Average System_Complexity < Average Ease_of_Use, so it does not meet the criteria.
- Group D: Average System_Complexity < Average Ease_of_Use, so it does not meet the criteria.

However, upon reviewing the calculations and the task, it seems there was an oversight in the initial analysis regarding the comparison and identification of groups where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score. Given the calculations:

- Only Group A has respondents where the comparison between 'System_Complexity' and 'Ease_of_Use' averages could potentially lead to a group meeting the criteria, but based on the calculations provided, no group meets the condition as stated because the averages were either equal or the 'System_Complexity' was less than 'Ease_of_Use' in all cases.

Given this correction and the specific request for respondents in groups where 'System_Complexity' averages are higher than 'Ease_of_Use' averages, and based on the provided data and calculations, there are no groups that meet this specific criterion as all groups either have equal averages or higher 'Ease_of_Use' averages. 

Thus, the correct answer, based on the provided data and the task's specific criteria, is that there are no respondents in a group where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score for that same group, as none of the groups meet this condition according to the calculations.",False

     - Respondent 52: 'Ease_of_Use' (4) + 'Integration_of_Functions' (4) = 8
     - Respondent 6: 'Ease_of_Use' (4) + 'Integration_of_Functions' (5) = 9
     - Respondent 76: 'Ease_of_Use' (5) + 'Integration_of_Functions' (4) = 9
     - Respondent 67: 'Ease_of_Use' (5) + 'Integration_of_Functions' (5) = 10

2. **Calculate the Average Score for the 'Senior' Group:**
   - Average = (8 + 9 + 9 + 10) / 4 = 36 / 4 = 9

3. **Identify Respondents with Scores Lower Than the Average:**
   - Now, calculate the total positive usability score for all respondents and compare it to the 'Senior' group average (9).
   - Respondent 10: 'Ease_of_Use' (4) + 'Integration_of_Functions' (5) = 9 (Equal to the average, not lower)
   - Respondent 52: Already calculated as 8 (Lower than the average)
   - Respondent 6: Already calculated as 9 (Equal to the average, not lower)
   - Respondent 76: Already calculated as 9 (Equal to the average, not lower)
   - Respondent 30: 'Ease_of_Use' (5) + 'Integration_of_Functions' (5) = 10 (Higher than the average)
   - Respondent 82: 'Ease_of_Use' (4) + 'Integration_of_Functions' (4) = 8 (Lower than the average)
   - Respondent 67: Already calculated as 10 (Higher than the average)
   - Respondent 20: 'Ease_of_Use' (5) + 'Integration_of_Functions' (4) = 9 (Equal to the average, not lower)

4. **List Respondents with Lower Scores:**
   - Respondents with scores lower than the 'Senior' group average are 52 and 82.

The final answer is: $\boxed{52, 82}$",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents are in a group where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score for that same group?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'System_Complexity' and 'Ease_of_Use' scores for each group, and then identify the groups where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score. Finally, we will list the respondents that belong to those groups.

### Step 1: Calculate Average Scores for Each Group

Let's calculate the average 'System_Complexity' and 'Ease_of_Use' scores for each group based on the provided responses.

- **Group A:**
  - Respondent 46: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 1
  - Respondent 56: System_Complexity = 2, Ease_of_Use = 4
  - Respondent 59: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
  - Average System_Complexity = (1 + 2 + 1) / 3 = 4 / 3 = 1.33
  - Average Ease_of_Use = (1 + 4 + 5) / 3 = 10 / 3 = 3.33

- **Group B:**
  - Respondent 44: System_Complexity = 2, Ease_of_Use = 5
  - Respondent 66: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
  - Respondent 79: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
  - Average System_Complexity = (2 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 4 / 3 = 1.33
  - Average Ease_of_Use = (5 + 5 + 5) / 3 = 15 / 3 = 5

- **Group C:**
  - Respondent 9: System_Complexity = 3, Ease_of_Use = 1
  - Respondent 33: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
  - Respondent 50: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
  - Respondent 51: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
  - Average System_Complexity = (3 + 1 + 1 + 1) / 4 = 6 / 4 = 1.5
  - Average Ease_of_Use = (1 + 5 + 5 + 5) / 4 = 16 / 4 = 4

- **Group D:**
  - Respondent 71: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
  - Respondent 74: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
  - Average System_Complexity = (1 + 1) / 2 = 2 / 2 = 1
  - Average Ease_of_Use = (5 + 5) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5

### Step 2: Identify Groups with Higher Average 'System_Complexity'

From the calculations above, we can see that:

- For Group A, the average 'System_Complexity' (1.33) is less than the average 'Ease_of_Use' (3.33).
- For Group B, the average 'System_Complexity' (1.33) is less than the average 'Ease_of_Use' (5).
- For Group C, the average 'System_Complexity' (1.5) is less than the average 'Ease_of_Use' (4).
- For Group D, the average 'System_Complexity' (1) is less than the average 'Ease_of_Use' (5).

It appears there was an oversight in the initial analysis regarding the comparison of average scores. Given the calculations, none of the groups have a higher average 'System_Complexity' score than their average 'Ease_of_Use' score. Therefore, based on the provided data and calculations, there are no respondents in a group where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score for that same group.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents whose total positive usability score ('Ease_of_Use' + 'Integration_of_Functions') is lower than the average for all respondents in the 'Senior' group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average total positive usability score for respondents in the 'Senior' group, and then identify all respondents whose score is lower than this average.

1. **Identify 'Senior' Group Respondents and Their Scores:**
   - From the data, respondents in the 'Senior' group are those with **Group:** A.
   - Respondents 72 and 65 are in the 'Senior' group.
   - For Respondent 72: 'Ease_of_Use' = 5, 'Integration_of_Functions' = 5. Total = 10.
   - For Respondent 65: 'Ease_of_Use' = 5, 'Integration_of_Functions' = 2. Total = 7.

2. **Calculate the Average Total Positive Usability Score for the 'Senior' Group:**
   - Average = (10 + 7) / 2 = 17 / 2 = 8.5.

3. **Calculate the Total Positive Usability Score for Each Respondent and Compare:**
   - We will list all respondents and their total scores, then identify those with scores lower than 8.5.
   - Respondent 71: 'Ease_of_Use' = 5, 'Integration_of_Functions' = 4. Total = 9.
   - Respondent 41: 'Ease_of_Use' = 5, 'Integration_of_Functions' = 5. Total = 10.
   - Respondent 17: 'Ease_of_Use' = 5, 'Integration_of_Functions' = 5. Total = 10.
   - Respondent 72: Already calculated as 10.
   - Respondent 69: 'Ease_of_Use' = 5, 'Integration_of_Functions' = 5. Total = 10.
   - Respondent 39: 'Ease_of_Use' = 1, 'Integration_of_Functions' = 5. Total = 6.
   - Respondent 65: Already calculated as 7.
   - Respondent 25: 'Ease_of_Use' = 3, 'Integration_of_Functions' = 3. Total = 6.

4. **List Respondents with Scores Lower Than 8.5:**
   - Respondent 39 (Total = 6).
   - Respondent 65 (Total = 7).
   - Respondent 25 (Total = 6).
   - Respondent 71 (Total = 9) is not lower than 8.5, so is not included.

Therefore, the respondents whose total positive usability score is lower than the average for all respondents in the 'Senior' group are **39, 65, 25**.",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents are in a group where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score for that same group?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'System_Complexity' and 'Ease_of_Use' scores for each group, and then identify the groups where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score. Finally, we will list the respondents that belong to those groups.

## Step 1: Calculate average scores for each group
We need to calculate the average 'System_Complexity' and 'Ease_of_Use' scores for each group (A, B, C, D) based on the responses provided.

## Step 2: Group A calculation
For Group A, we have respondents 42 and 6.
- Respondent 42: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
- Respondent 6: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 4
Average System_Complexity for Group A = (1 + 1) / 2 = 1
Average Ease_of_Use for Group A = (5 + 4) / 2 = 4.5

## Step 3: Group B calculation
For Group B, we have respondents 66 and 36.
- Respondent 66: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
- Respondent 36: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
Average System_Complexity for Group B = (1 + 1) / 2 = 1
Average Ease_of_Use for Group B = (5 + 5) / 2 = 5

## Step 4: Group C calculation
For Group C, we have respondents 9, 53, and 88.
- Respondent 9: System_Complexity = 3, Ease_of_Use = 1
- Respondent 53: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
- Respondent 88: System_Complexity = 2, Ease_of_Use = 5
Average System_Complexity for Group C = (3 + 1 + 2) / 3 = 2
Average Ease_of_Use for Group C = (1 + 5 + 5) / 3 = 3.67

## Step 5: Group D calculation
For Group D, we have respondents 45, 15, 71, and 7.
- Respondent 45: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 4
- Respondent 15: System_Complexity = 2, Ease_of_Use = 4
- Respondent 71: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
- Respondent 7: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
Average System_Complexity for Group D = (1 + 2 + 1 + 1) / 4 = 1.25
Average Ease_of_Use for Group D = (4 + 4 + 5 + 5) / 4 = 4.5

## Step 6: Identify groups where average 'System_Complexity' is higher than average 'Ease_of_Use'
From the calculations:
- Group A: Average System_Complexity (1) < Average Ease_of_Use (4.5)
- Group B: Average System_Complexity (1) < Average Ease_of_Use (5)
- Group C: Average System_Complexity (2) > Average Ease_of_Use (3.67)
- Group D: Average System_Complexity (1.25) < Average Ease_of_Use (4.5)
Only Group C has an average 'System_Complexity' score higher than its average 'Ease_of_Use' score.

## Step 7: List respondents in the identified group
The respondents in Group C are 9, 53, and 88.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9, 53, 88}$",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'Inconsistency' is higher than the average 'Inconsistency' for the 'Middle' group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Inconsistency' for the 'Middle' group. Then, we compare each respondent's 'Inconsistency' score to this average, identifying those with higher scores.

1. **Identify Respondents in the 'Middle' Group:**
   - Respondent 82: **Group:** C (which corresponds to 'Middle' according to the schema), **Inconsistency:** 1
   - Respondent 43: **Group:** C (which corresponds to 'Middle' according to the schema), **Inconsistency:** 1

2. **Calculate the Average 'Inconsistency' for the 'Middle' Group:**
   - The sum of 'Inconsistency' scores for the 'Middle' group is 1 (from Respondent 82) + 1 (from Respondent 43) = 2.
   - The number of respondents in the 'Middle' group is 2.
   - Therefore, the average 'Inconsistency' for the 'Middle' group is 2 / 2 = 1.

3. **Find Respondents with 'Inconsistency' Higher than the Average:**
   - We will go through each respondent's data and compare their 'Inconsistency' score to the average 'Inconsistency' of the 'Middle' group, which is 1.
   - Respondents with 'Inconsistency' scores higher than 1 are:
     - Respondent 64: **Inconsistency:** 4
     - Respondent 35: **Inconsistency:** 5
     - Respondent 61: **Inconsistency:** 4
     - Respondent 89: **Inconsistency:** 3

4. **List the IDs of These Respondents:**
   - The IDs are 64, 35, 61, 89.

The final answer is: $\boxed{64, 35, 61, 89}$",False
