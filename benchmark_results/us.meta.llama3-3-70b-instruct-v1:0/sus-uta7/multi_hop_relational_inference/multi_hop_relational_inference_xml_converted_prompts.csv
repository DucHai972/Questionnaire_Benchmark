</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</task>","To determine which respondents are in the same group as respondent '47', we first need to identify the group of respondent '47'. According to the data, respondent '47' has an answer for the question ""Group"" as ""B"". 

Referring to the 'questions' section, the question ""Group"" is defined as ""[MCQ: A. Senior B. Junior C. Middle D. Intern]"". Therefore, ""B"" corresponds to ""Junior"".

Next, we need to find all respondents who are also in the ""Junior"" group. This means we are looking for respondents with an answer of ""B"" (since B corresponds to Junior) for the ""Group"" question.

From the provided data, the respondents in the ""Junior"" group (answer ""B"" for the ""Group"" question) are:

- Respondent '8'
- Respondent '47'

Therefore, the respondents in the same group as respondent '47' are 8, 47.",True

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents are in the same group as respondent '20'?
</task>","To determine which respondents are in the same group as respondent '20', we first need to identify the group of respondent '20'. According to the data, respondent '20' has an answer for the question ""Group"" as ""C"", which corresponds to ""Middle"" based on the schema provided.

Now, we need to find all respondents who also have ""C"" (Middle) as their answer for the ""Group"" question.

From the provided data:
- Respondent '39' is in group ""C"" (Middle).
- Respondent '51' is in group ""C"" (Middle).
- Respondent '62' is in group ""C"" (Middle).
- Respondent '20' is in group ""C"" (Middle), which is the reference respondent.

Therefore, the respondents in the same group as respondent '20' are '39', '51', '62', and '20' itself. However, since the task is to identify other respondents in the same group, and given the format requirements, we should list the IDs of respondents excluding '20' as it's the reference point:

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents who rated 'Integration_of_Functions' the same as respondent '84'.
</task>","To find the respondents who rated 'Integration_of_Functions' the same as respondent '84', we first need to determine how respondent '84' rated 'Integration_of_Functions'. According to the data, respondent '84' rated 'Integration_of_Functions' as 4.

Now, we will go through the responses to find all respondents who also rated 'Integration_of_Functions' as 4.

- Respondent '80' rated 'Integration_of_Functions' as 4.
- Respondent '33' rated 'Integration_of_Functions' as 5.
- Respondent '46' rated 'Integration_of_Functions' as 1.
- Respondent '89' rated 'Integration_of_Functions' as 5.
- Respondent '84' rated 'Integration_of_Functions' as 4.
- Respondent '68' rated 'Integration_of_Functions' as 5.

Only respondent '80' and respondent '84' rated 'Integration_of_Functions' as 4. 

The final answer is: 80, 84",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondents are in the same group as respondent '34'?
</task>","To determine which respondents are in the same group as respondent '34', we first need to identify the group of respondent '34'. According to the data, respondent '34' has an answer for the question ""Group"" as ""A"". 

Referring to the 'questions' section, the question ""Group"" is defined as ""[MCQ: A. Senior B. Junior C. Middle D. Intern]"". Therefore, the group of respondent '34' is ""Senior"".

Next, we need to find other respondents who are also in the ""Senior"" group. We look for respondents with an answer ""A"" (since A corresponds to Senior) for the ""Group"" question.

From the data:
- Respondent '11' has an answer ""A"" for the ""Group"" question, which means this respondent is also in the ""Senior"" group.
- Respondent '34' is already identified as being in the ""Senior"" group.

Therefore, the respondents in the same group as respondent '34' are '11' and '34'.",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents who gave the same 'Ease_of_Use' score as respondent '51', excluding the respondent themselves.
</task>","To find the respondents who gave the same 'Ease_of_Use' score as respondent '51', we first need to determine respondent '51's 'Ease_of_Use' score. According to the data, respondent '51' has an 'Ease_of_Use' score of 5.

Next, we need to find all other respondents who also have an 'Ease_of_Use' score of 5, excluding respondent '51'. 

From the data:
- Respondent '42' has an 'Ease_of_Use' score of 5.
- Respondent '20' has an 'Ease_of_Use' score of 5.
- Respondent '7' has an 'Ease_of_Use' score of 5.
- Respondent '84' has an 'Ease_of_Use' score of 1, which does not match.

Therefore, the respondents who gave the same 'Ease_of_Use' score as respondent '51', excluding respondent '51', are respondents '42', '20', and '7'.

The final answer is: 42, 20, 7",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondents are in the same group as respondent '25'?
</task>","To determine which respondents are in the same group as respondent '25', we first need to identify the group of respondent '25'. According to the data, respondent '25' has an answer for the question ""Group"" as ""D"". 

Referring to the 'questions' section, the question ""Group"" is defined as ""[MCQ: A. Senior B. Junior C. Middle D. Intern]"". Therefore, the group of respondent '25' is ""Intern"".

Next, we need to find other respondents who are also in the ""Intern"" group. Looking through the responses:

- Respondent '30' is in group ""D"", which corresponds to ""Intern"".
- Respondent '48' is in group ""D"", which corresponds to ""Intern"".
- Respondent '49' is in group ""D"", which corresponds to ""Intern"".

Thus, the respondents in the same group as respondent '25' are '30', '48', and '49'.

The final answer is: 30, 48, 49",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents who gave the same 'Ease_of_Use' score as respondent '5', excluding the respondent themselves.
</task>","To find the respondents who gave the same 'Ease_of_Use' score as respondent '5', we first need to determine the 'Ease_of_Use' score of respondent '5'. According to the data, respondent '5' has an 'Ease_of_Use' score of 5.

Now, we will go through the responses of all other respondents to find those who also have an 'Ease_of_Use' score of 5.

- Respondent '74' has an 'Ease_of_Use' score of 5.
- Respondent '55' has an 'Ease_of_Use' score of 2.
- Respondent '62' has an 'Ease_of_Use' score of 5.
- Respondent '2' has an 'Ease_of_Use' score of 4.

Therefore, the respondents who gave the same 'Ease_of_Use' score as respondent '5' (excluding respondent '5' themselves) are respondents '74' and '62'.",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents who rated 'Inconsistency' the same as respondent '61'.
</task>","To find the respondents who rated 'Inconsistency' the same as respondent '61', we first need to determine how respondent '61' rated 'Inconsistency'. According to the data, respondent '61' rated 'Inconsistency' as 4.

Now, we will go through the responses to find all respondents who also rated 'Inconsistency' as 4.

- Respondent '58' rated 'Inconsistency' as 1.
- Respondent '72' rated 'Inconsistency' as 1.
- Respondent '60' rated 'Inconsistency' as 2.
- Respondent '66' rated 'Inconsistency' as 2.
- Respondent '76' rated 'Inconsistency' as 2.
- Respondent '25' rated 'Inconsistency' as 4.
- Respondent '24' rated 'Inconsistency' as 4.
- Respondent '61' rated 'Inconsistency' as 4.

Therefore, the respondents who rated 'Inconsistency' the same as respondent '61' (which is 4) are respondents '25', '24', and '61' itself.

The final answer is: 24, 25, 61",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents who gave the same 'Ease_of_Use' score as respondent '45', excluding the respondent themselves.
</task>","To find the respondents who gave the same 'Ease_of_Use' score as respondent '45', we first need to determine the 'Ease_of_Use' score of respondent '45'. According to the data, respondent '45' has an 'Ease_of_Use' score of 4.

Now, we will go through the responses of all other respondents to find those with the same 'Ease_of_Use' score of 4.

- Respondent '61' has an 'Ease_of_Use' score of 2.
- Respondent '35' has an 'Ease_of_Use' score of 1.
- Respondent '85' has an 'Ease_of_Use' score of 5.
- Respondent '68' has an 'Ease_of_Use' score of 4. This matches the score of respondent '45'.
- Respondent '86' has an 'Ease_of_Use' score of 1.
- Respondent '19' has an 'Ease_of_Use' score of 5.

Therefore, the respondent who gave the same 'Ease_of_Use' score as respondent '45' is respondent '68'.",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents who rated 'Integration_of_Functions' the same as respondent '24'.
</task>","To find the respondents who rated 'Integration_of_Functions' the same as respondent '24', we first need to determine how respondent '24' rated 'Integration_of_Functions'. 

According to the data, respondent '24' rated 'Integration_of_Functions' as 1.

Now, we need to find all respondents who also rated 'Integration_of_Functions' as 1.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents are in the same group as respondent '79'?
</task>","To determine which respondents are in the same group as respondent '79', we first need to identify the group of respondent '79'. According to the data, respondent '79' has an answer for the question ""Group"" as ""B"". 

Referring to the 'questions' section, the question ""Group"" is defined as ""[MCQ: A. Senior B. Junior C. Middle D. Intern]"". Therefore, ""B"" corresponds to ""Junior"".

Next, we need to find all respondents who are also in the ""Junior"" group. Looking through the responses:

- Respondent '14' is in group ""B"", which means ""Junior"".
- Respondent '68' is in group ""B"", which means ""Junior"".
- Respondent '32' is in group ""B"", which means ""Junior"".

Thus, the respondents in the same group as respondent '79' are '14', '68', and '32'. 

The final answer is: 14, 68, 32",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents who gave the same 'Ease_of_Use' score as respondent '58', excluding the respondent themselves.
</task>","To find the respondents who gave the same 'Ease_of_Use' score as respondent '58', we first need to determine the 'Ease_of_Use' score of respondent '58'. According to the data, respondent '58' has an 'Ease_of_Use' score of 5.

Now, we will go through the responses of all other respondents to find those with the same 'Ease_of_Use' score of 5, excluding respondent '58' themselves.

Respondent '47' has an 'Ease_of_Use' score of 4.
Respondent '61' has an 'Ease_of_Use' score of 2.
Respondent '62' has an 'Ease_of_Use' score of 5.
Respondent '37' has an 'Ease_of_Use' score of 5.
Respondent '54' has an 'Ease_of_Use' score of 5.
Respondent '30' has an 'Ease_of_Use' score of 5.

Therefore, the respondents who gave the same 'Ease_of_Use' score as respondent '58' (excluding respondent '58' themselves) are respondents '62', '37', '54', and '30'.",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents who rated 'Cumbersome_to_Use' the same as respondent '47'.
</task>","To find the respondents who rated 'Cumbersome_to_Use' the same as respondent '47', we first need to determine how respondent '47' rated 'Cumbersome_to_Use'. According to the data, respondent '47' rated 'Cumbersome_to_Use' as 1, which means they strongly disagree that the system is cumbersome to use.

Now, we will look through the responses to find any other respondents who also rated 'Cumbersome_to_Use' as 1.

- Respondent '67' rated 'Cumbersome_to_Use' as 1.
- Respondent '54' rated 'Cumbersome_to_Use' as 1.
- Respondent '39' rated 'Cumbersome_to_Use' as 4, which does not match.
- Respondent '38' rated 'Cumbersome_to_Use' as 1.

Therefore, the respondents who rated 'Cumbersome_to_Use' the same as respondent '47' are 67, 54, and 38.",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Find all respondents who gave the same 'Ease_of_Use' score as respondent '11', excluding the respondent themselves.
</task>","To find the respondents who gave the same 'Ease_of_Use' score as respondent '11', we first need to determine the 'Ease_of_Use' score of respondent '11'. According to the data, respondent '11' has an 'Ease_of_Use' score of 5.

Now, we will go through the responses to find all respondents who also have an 'Ease_of_Use' score of 5, excluding respondent '11' themselves.

The respondents with an 'Ease_of_Use' score of 5 are:
- Respondent '32'
- Respondent '4'
- Respondent '58'
- Respondent '90'
- Respondent '16'
- Respondent '30'

Therefore, the list of respondent IDs who gave the same 'Ease_of_Use' score as respondent '11', excluding respondent '11', is: 32, 4, 58, 90, 16, 30.",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Find all respondents who gave the same 'Ease_of_Use' score as respondent '11', excluding the respondent themselves.
</task>","To find the respondents who gave the same 'Ease_of_Use' score as respondent '11', we first need to determine the 'Ease_of_Use' score of respondent '11'. According to the data, respondent '11' has an 'Ease_of_Use' score of 5.

Now, we will go through the responses to find other respondents who also have an 'Ease_of_Use' score of 5, excluding respondent '11' themselves.

Respondent '38' has an 'Ease_of_Use' score of 5.
Respondent '76' has an 'Ease_of_Use' score of 5.
Respondent '40' has an 'Ease_of_Use' score of 5.
Respondent '49' has an 'Ease_of_Use' score of 5.
Respondent '68' has an 'Ease_of_Use' score of 4, which does not match.
Respondent '46' has an 'Ease_of_Use' score of 1, which does not match.
Respondent '3' has an 'Ease_of_Use' score of 3, which does not match.
Respondent '55' has an 'Ease_of_Use' score of 2, which does not match.

The IDs of the respondents who gave the same 'Ease_of_Use' score as respondent '11' (excluding respondent '11') are: 38, 76, 40, 49.",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents are in the same group as respondent '22'?
</task>","To determine which respondents are in the same group as respondent '22', we first need to identify the group of respondent '22'. According to the data, respondent '22' has an answer for the question ""Group"" as ""C"", which corresponds to ""Middle"" based on the schema provided.

Now, we need to find all respondents who also have ""C"" (Middle) as their answer for the ""Group"" question.

From the provided data:
- Respondent '50' is in group ""C"" (Middle).
- Respondent '24' is in group ""C"" (Middle).
- Respondent '22' is in group ""C"" (Middle), as identified.

Therefore, the respondents in the same group as respondent '22' are '50' and '24'. 

The final answer is: 50, 24",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Find all respondents who gave the same 'Ease_of_Use' score as respondent '40', excluding the respondent themselves.
</task>","To find the respondents who gave the same 'Ease_of_Use' score as respondent '40', we first need to determine respondent '40's 'Ease_of_Use' score.

According to the data, respondent '40' has an 'Ease_of_Use' score of 5.

Now, we need to find all other respondents who also have an 'Ease_of_Use' score of 5.

Respondents '49' and '28' also have an 'Ease_of_Use' score of 5.

Therefore, the respondents who gave the same 'Ease_of_Use' score as respondent '40', excluding respondent '40' themselves, are respondents '49' and '28'.

- Respondent '26' has a 'Confidence_in_Use' score of 4 and an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 4, which does not match our criteria.
- Respondent '85' has a 'Confidence_in_Use' score of 5 and an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 5, which does not match our criteria because the 'Confidence_in_Use' score is not 4.
- Respondent '27' has a 'Confidence_in_Use' score of 2 and an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 2, which does not match our criteria.
- Respondent '56' has a 'Confidence_in_Use' score of 5 and an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 5, which does not match our criteria because the 'Confidence_in_Use' score is not 4.
- Respondent '77' has a 'Confidence_in_Use' score of 5 and an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 5, which does not match our criteria because the 'Confidence_in_Use' score is not 4.

None of the respondents match the criteria of having a 'Confidence_in_Use' score of 4 and an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 5. Therefore, there are no respondents who meet the specified conditions.",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents who gave the same 'Confidence_in_Use' score as respondent '82' and who also strongly agree that the system is easy to learn (score of 5).
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to identify the 'Confidence_in_Use' score of respondent '82' and then find all respondents who have the same score and also have a score of 5 for 'Ease_of_Learning'.

From the provided data, respondent '82' has the following scores:
- 'Confidence_in_Use': 4
- 'Ease_of_Learning': 5

Now, we need to find all respondents who have a 'Confidence_in_Use' score of 4 and an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 5.

Respondents with 'Confidence_in_Use' score of 4 and 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 5 are:
- 15
- 29
- 82

These respondents match the criteria of having the same 'Confidence_in_Use' score as respondent '82' (which is 4) and strongly agreeing that the system is easy to learn (score of 5 for 'Ease_of_Learning'). 

The final answer is: 15, 29, 82",True

Which respondents are in the same group as respondent '78' and also rated 'System_Complexity' as 5?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the group of respondent '78'.
2. Identify respondents who are in the same group as respondent '78'.
3. Filter those respondents to only include those who rated 'System_Complexity' as 5.

From the data, respondent '78' has the following answer for the ""Group"" question:
```
<answer question=""Group"">D</answer>
```
According to the schema, 'D' corresponds to ""Intern"". 

Now, let's find all respondents who are also in the ""Intern"" group:
```
<respondent id=""71"">
  <answer question=""Group"">D</answer>
...
<respondent id=""10"">
  <answer question=""Group"">D</answer>

...
<respondent id=""12"">
  <answer question=""Group"">D</answer>
...
<respondent id=""78"">
  <answer question=""Group"">D</answer>
...
```
These respondents are in the same group as respondent '78'. However, we need to find those who also rated 'System_Complexity' as 5. Let's check their answers for 'System_Complexity':

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents who share the same 'Frequent_Usage' score as respondent '6' but are not in the same group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to identify the 'Frequent_Usage' score of respondent '6' and their group. Then, we will find all respondents who have the same 'Frequent_Usage' score but are in a different group.

From the provided data, respondent '6' has a 'Frequent_Usage' score of 5 and is in group 'A'.

Now, let's find all respondents with a 'Frequent_Usage' score of 5:

- Respondent '6' is in group 'A' with a 'Frequent_Usage' score of 5.
- No other respondents have a 'Frequent_Usage' score of 5.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Find all respondents who gave the same 'Confidence_in_Use' score as respondent '90' and who also strongly agree that the system is easy to learn (score of 5).
</task>","To find the respondents who gave the same 'Confidence_in_Use' score as respondent '90' and who also strongly agree that the system is easy to learn (score of 5), we first need to identify respondent '90's score for 'Confidence_in_Use' and then find other respondents with the same score who also have a score of 5 for 'Ease_of_Learning'.

According to the data, respondent '90' has a 'Confidence_in_Use' score of 5. Now, we need to find all respondents with a 'Confidence_in_Use' score of 5 and an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 5.

Respondents with a 'Confidence_in_Use' score of 5 and an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 5 are:
- Respondent '10' has a 'Confidence_in_Use' score of 5 and an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 5.
- Respondent '28' has a 'Confidence_in_Use' score of 5 and an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 5.
- Respondent '5' has a 'Confidence_in_Use' score of 5 and an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 5.

Therefore, the respondents who meet the criteria are 10, 28, 5.",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents who share the same 'Ease_of_Learning' score as respondent '84' but are not in the same group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to identify the 'Ease_of_Learning' score of respondent '84' and their group. Then, we will find all respondents who have the same 'Ease_of_Learning' score but are in a different group.

From the provided data, respondent '84' has an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 2 and is in group 'D'.

Now, let's find all respondents with an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 2 who are not in group 'D':

- Respondent '22' has an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 4, which does not match.
- Respondent '30' has an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 5, which does not match.
- Respondent '36' has an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 5, which does not match.
- Respondent '62' has an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 1, which does not match.
- Respondent '69' has an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 5, which does not match.
- Respondent '74' has an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 5, which does not match.
- Respondent '81' has an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 5, which does not match.

Actually, upon reviewing the data again for accuracy:

- Respondent '84' has an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 2.
- Respondent '22' has an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 4.
- Respondent '30' has an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 5.
- Respondent '36' has an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 5.
- Respondent '62' has an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 1.
- Respondent '69' has an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 5.
- Respondent '74' has an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 5.
- Respondent '81' has an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 5.

It seems there was an oversight in the initial analysis. Respondent '84' is the only one with an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 2. Therefore, there are no other respondents who share the same 'Ease_of_Learning' score as respondent '84'. 

The final answer is: $\boxed{None}$",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents who gave the same 'Confidence_in_Use' score as respondent '40' and who also strongly agree that the system is easy to learn (score of 5).
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to identify the 'Confidence_in_Use' score of respondent '40' and then find all respondents who have the same score and also have a score of 5 for 'Ease_of_Learning'.

From the provided data, respondent '40' has the following relevant answers:
- Confidence_in_Use: 5
- Ease_of_Learning: 5

Now, we need to find all respondents who have a 'Confidence_in_Use' score of 5 and an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 5.

Respondents with 'Confidence_in_Use' score of 5 and 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 5 are:
- 4
- 30
- 40
- 47
- 13

These respondents have the same 'Confidence_in_Use' score as respondent '40' and also strongly agree that the system is easy to learn.",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents who share the same 'Integration_of_Functions' score as respondent '65' but are not in the same group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to identify the 'Integration_of_Functions' score of respondent '65' and their group. Then, we will find all respondents who have the same 'Integration_of_Functions' score but are in a different group.

From the provided data, respondent '65' has:
- Group: A
- Integration_of_Functions score: 2

Now, we need to find all respondents who have an 'Integration_of_Functions' score of 2 but are not in group A.

After examining the data:
- Respondent '23' has an 'Integration_of_Functions' score of 4, which does not match.
- Respondent '32' has an 'Integration_of_Functions' score of 5, which does not match.
- Respondent '3' has an 'Integration_of_Functions' score of 2 and is in group B, which matches our criteria.
- Respondent '8' has an 'Integration_of_Functions' score of 5, which does not match.
- Respondent '11' has an 'Integration_of_Functions' score of 5, which does not match.
- Respondent '1' has an 'Integration_of_Functions' score of 5, which does not match.
- Respondent '37' has an 'Integration_of_Functions' score of 5, which does not match.
- Respondent '43' has an 'Integration_of_Functions' score of 5, which does not match.
- Respondent '81' has an 'Integration_of_Functions' score of 4, which does not match.

Only respondent '3' matches the criteria of having the same 'Integration_of_Functions' score (2) as respondent '65' but not being in the same group (A).

The final answer is: 3",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents who share the same 'Integration_of_Functions' score as respondent '88' but are not in the same group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to identify the 'Integration_of_Functions' score of respondent '88' and their group. Then, we will find all respondents who have the same 'Integration_of_Functions' score but are in a different group.

From the provided data, respondent '88' has:
- Group: C
- Integration_of_Functions score: 4

Now, we will list all respondents who have an 'Integration_of_Functions' score of 4 but are not in group C:

- Respondent '78' has an 'Integration_of_Functions' score of 4 and is in group D.
- Respondent '82' has an 'Integration_of_Functions' score of 4 and is in group C, so this respondent is excluded because they are in the same group as '88'.
- Respondent '80' has an 'Integration_of_Functions' score of 4 and is in group A.
- Respondent '81' has an 'Integration_of_Functions' score of 4 and is in group A.
- Respondent '12' has an 'Integration_of_Functions' score of 5, so this respondent is excluded.
- Respondent '66' has an 'Integration_of_Functions' score of 5, so this respondent is excluded.
- Respondent '5' has an 'Integration_of_Functions' score of 5, so this respondent is excluded.
- Respondent '48' has an 'Integration_of_Functions' score of 5, so this respondent is excluded.
- Respondent '86' has an 'Integration_of_Functions' score of 5, so this respondent is excluded.

Thus, the respondents who share the same 'Integration_of_Functions' score as respondent '88' but are not in the same group are:

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents who share the same 'Inconsistency' score as respondent '54' but are not in the same group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to identify the 'Inconsistency' score of respondent '54' and their group. Then, we will find all respondents who have the same 'Inconsistency' score but are in a different group.

From the provided data, respondent '54' has an 'Inconsistency' score of 1 and is in group 'C'.

Now, let's find all respondents with an 'Inconsistency' score of 1 who are not in group 'C':

- Respondent '82' has an 'Inconsistency' score of 1 and is in group 'C', so they do not meet the criteria.
- Respondent '54' is the reference and does not need to be included in the list.
- Respondent '55' has an 'Inconsistency' score of 1 and is in group 'A', so they meet the criteria.
- Respondent '14' has an 'Inconsistency' score of 1 and is in group 'B', so they meet the criteria.
- Respondent '47' has an 'Inconsistency' score of 1 and is in group 'B', so they meet the criteria.
- Respondent '90' has an 'Inconsistency' score of 2, so they do not meet the criteria.
- Respondent '60' has an 'Inconsistency' score of 2, so they do not meet the criteria.
- Respondent '48' has an 'Inconsistency' score of 1 and is in group 'D', so they meet the criteria.
- Respondent '6' has an 'Inconsistency' score of 1 and is in group 'A', so they meet the criteria.
- Respondent '78' has an 'Inconsistency' score of 4, so they do not meet the criteria.

The respondents who share the same 'Inconsistency' score as respondent '54' but are not in the same group are: 55, 14, 47, 48, 6. 

These respondents are in groups A, B, and D, which are different from respondent '54's group C. 

The final answer is: 55, 14, 47, 48, 6.",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents who share the same 'Ease_of_Learning' score as respondent '50' but are not in the same group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to identify the 'Ease_of_Learning' score of respondent '50' and their group. Then, we will find all respondents who have the same 'Ease_of_Learning' score but are in a different group.

From the provided data, respondent '50' has an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 4 and is in group 'C'.

Now, let's find all respondents with an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 4 who are not in group 'C':

- Respondent '25' has an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 1, which does not match.
- Respondent '29' has an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 5, which does not match.
- Respondent '34' has an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 2, which does not match.
- Respondent '4' has an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 2, which does not match.
- Respondent '51' has an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 5, which does not match.
- Respondent '73' has an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 5, which does not match.
- Respondent '1' has an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 5, which does not match.
- Respondent '27' has an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 2, which does not match.

Actually, upon re-examining the data provided, it seems there was an oversight in the initial analysis regarding the 'Ease_of_Learning' score for respondent '50', which is actually 4. Let's correct the approach by directly identifying respondents with the same 'Ease_of_Learning' score as respondent '50' (which is 4) and ensuring they are not in the same group as respondent '50' (group 'C'):

- Respondent '50' is in group 'C' with an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 4.
- The only other respondent with an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 4 is not found among the ones listed with a detailed match, indicating a need to correct the analysis based on the actual data provided.

Given the correct 'Ease_of_Learning' score for respondent '50' is 4, and upon reviewing the data again for accuracy:

Respondent '50' has an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 4. The respondents with the same 'Ease_of_Learning' score are actually not listed correctly in the initial analysis. The correct approach should involve directly comparing the 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 4 for respondent '50' with all other respondents and identifying those not in group 'C'. 

Upon a detailed review:
- Respondent '25' has an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 1 and is in group 'D', which matches the criteria of not being in group 'C' but does not match the 'Ease_of_Learning' score.
- Respondent '29' has an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 5 and is in group 'D', which does not match.
- Respondent '51' and '73' and '1' have 'Ease_of_Learning' scores of 5, which does not match.
- Respondent '4' has an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 2, which does not match.
- Respondent '34' has an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 2, which does not match.
- Respondent '27' has an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 2, which does not match.

Actually, the mistake was in assuming there were matches without properly accounting for the 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 4 and the group affiliation. The correct match based on the 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 4 for respondent '50' and not being in the same group 'C' is not directly found as initially thought. 

Given this, the correct approach is to identify any respondent with an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 4 (like respondent '50') and ensure they are not in group 'C'. However, upon a thorough review, it appears the initial analysis missed correctly identifying such respondents due to an error in matching the 'Ease_of_Learning' score and group criteria correctly.

The correct list of respondents who share the same 'Ease_of_Learning' score as respondent '50' (which is 4) but are not in the same group 'C' should be identified by their IDs. However, based on the provided data and correcting for the oversight, the actual task is to find respondents with the 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 4 who are not in group 'C'. 

Since respondent '50' has an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 4 and is in group 'C', and upon reviewing the data again, there seems to have been a misunderstanding in directly applying the criteria to find matching respondents not in group 'C' with the same 'Ease_of_Learning' score. 

Given the data and the need to correct the analysis:
- The 'Ease_of_Learning' score for respondent '50' is indeed 4.
- The group for respondent '50' is 'C'.

To correctly answer the task without the confusion:
We need to find respondents with an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 4 who are not in group 'C'. 

Upon carefully reviewing the data provided and correcting the approach for accuracy in identifying respondents with the same 'Ease_of_Learning' score as respondent '50' (4) and not in the same group 'C', it's clear there was an initial mistake in directly identifying such respondents based on the provided criteria.

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
List all respondents who share the same 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score as respondent '5' but are not in the same group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to identify the 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score of respondent '5' and their group. Then, we will find all respondents who have the same 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score but are in a different group.

From the provided data, respondent '5' has the following answers:
- Group: C
- Need_for_Technical_Support: 1

So, we are looking for respondents who have a 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score of 1 but are not in group C.

Let's examine the responses:
- Respondent '59': Group A, Need_for_Technical_Support: 1
- Respondent '75': Group A, Need_for_Technical_Support: 1
- Respondent '68': Group B, Need_for_Technical_Support: 4 (does not match)
- Respondent '32': Group B, Need_for_Technical_Support: 1
- Respondent '37': Group C, Need_for_Technical_Support: 2 (does not match because of the group and score)
- Respondent '86': Group A, Need_for_Technical_Support: 5 (does not match)
- Respondent '82': Group C, Need_for_Technical_Support: 1 (does not match because of the group)
- Respondent '27': Group C, Need_for_Technical_Support: 4 (does not match)
- Respondent '17': Group C, Need_for_Technical_Support: 1 (does not match because of the group)

The respondents who share the same 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score (1) as respondent '5' but are not in the same group (C) are:
59, 75, 32

These respondents are in groups A and B, which are different from respondent '5's group C.",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' is higher than the average 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' for the 'Intern' group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' for the 'Intern' group. Then, we compare this average with the 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' of all respondents to find those whose score is higher.

1. **Identify 'Intern' Group Respondents**: 
   - From the schema, 'Intern' corresponds to option 'D'.
   - Respondents with 'Group' = 'D' are in the 'Intern' group.

2. **Calculate Average 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' for 'Intern' Group**:
   - Relevant respondents are 49, 30, 74, and 71.
   - Their 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' scores are 5, 1, 1, and 1, respectively.
   - Average = (5 + 1 + 1 + 1) / 4 = 8 / 4 = 2.

3. **Find Respondents with 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' Higher than the Average**:
   - We look for respondents with 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' > 2.
   - Relevant respondents are:
     - 49 (Intern group, score = 5)
     - 22 (Middle group, score = 2) -> Not higher, exactly the average when considering the question's request for ""higher than""
     - 89 (Senior group, score = 3)
     - 37 does not have a score higher than 2.

Given the task, the IDs of respondents whose 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' is higher than the average for the 'Intern' group are 49, 89. 

The final answer is: $\boxed{49, 89}$",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents who share the same 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score as respondent '12' but are not in the same group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to identify the 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score of respondent '12' and their group. Then, we will find all respondents who have the same 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score but are in a different group.

From the provided data, respondent '12' has:
- 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score: 2
- Group: D

Now, we need to find all respondents with a 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score of 2 but are not in group D.

Upon examining the data:
- Respondent '15' has a 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score of 1, which does not match.
- Respondent '4' has a 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score of 1, which does not match.
- Respondent '36' has a 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score of 1, which does not match.
- Respondent '32' has a 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score of 1, which does not match.
- Respondent '29' has a 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score of 1, which does not match.
- Respondent '18' has a 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score of 1, which does not match.
- Respondent '14' has a 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score of 1, which does not match.
- Respondent '87' has a 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score of 1, which does not match.
- Respondent '70' has a 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score of 1, which does not match.
- Respondent '82' has a 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score of 1, which does not match.
- Respondent '12' is the only one with a 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score of 2, and we are looking for others not in their group (D).

Since there are no other respondents with a 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score of 2, the list of respondents who share the same score but are not in the same group as respondent '12' is empty.",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents are in a group where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score for that same group?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'System_Complexity' and 'Ease_of_Use' scores for each group. Then, we identify the groups where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score. Finally, we list the respondents who belong to those groups.

Let's calculate the averages for each group based on the provided data:

1. **Group A**:
   - System_Complexity: (5 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 7 / 3 = 2.33
   - Ease_of_Use: (1 + 5 + 5) / 3 = 11 / 3 = 3.67
   - Since 2.33 < 3.67, Group A does not meet the criteria.

2. **Group C**:
   - System_Complexity: (1 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 3 / 3 = 1
   - Ease_of_Use: (5 + 5 + 5) / 3 = 15 / 3 = 5
   - Since 1 < 5, Group C does not meet the criteria.

3. **Group D**:
   - System_Complexity: (1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 1) / 7 = 9 / 7 = 1.29
   - Ease_of_Use: (5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 2 + 3 + 5) / 7 = 30 / 7 = 4.29
   - Since 1.29 < 4.29, Group D does not meet the criteria.

However, upon reviewing the initial assessment, it appears there was an oversight in the calculation and comparison process, particularly in identifying groups where the average 'System_Complexity' score exceeds the average 'Ease_of_Use' score. Given the corrected understanding that no group meets the specific condition as initially calculated, let's re-evaluate the process and directly address the task:

The task requires identifying respondents in groups where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score. Based on the calculations provided, none of the groups (A, C, D) have an average 'System_Complexity' score higher than their average 'Ease_of_Use' score. Thus, there are no respondents that meet the specified condition based on the calculations performed.

Given this, the correct response to the task, following the format and rules provided, should reflect that no respondents are in a group where the condition is met. However, the instructions and the nature of the task imply a need to identify specific respondents or groups, but the calculations indicate that no such groups exist under the given conditions.

Therefore, based on the calculations and the specific conditions provided in the task, the answer would reflect the absence of respondents meeting the criteria, but since the format demands a specific type of response (e.g., a list of IDs or a count), and given the nature of the task does not align with the calculated outcomes, the response should acknowledge the process and the findings:

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'Inconsistency' is higher than the average 'Inconsistency' for the 'Junior' group.
</task>","To find the respondents whose 'Inconsistency' is higher than the average 'Inconsistency' for the 'Junior' group, we first need to calculate the average 'Inconsistency' for the 'Junior' group.

From the provided data, the respondents in the 'Junior' group (B) are:

- Respondent 23 with 'Inconsistency' = 2

There is only one respondent in the 'Junior' group, so the average 'Inconsistency' for this group is 2.

Next, we need to find all respondents whose 'Inconsistency' is higher than 2. From the data:

- Respondent 90 has 'Inconsistency' = 2 (not higher than 2)
- Respondent 49 has 'Inconsistency' = 4 (higher than 2)
- Respondent 15 has 'Inconsistency' = 1 (not higher than 2)
- Respondent 29 has 'Inconsistency' = 1 (not higher than 2)
- Respondent 53 has 'Inconsistency' = 1 (not higher than 2)
- Respondent 67 has 'Inconsistency' = 1 (not higher than 2)
- Respondent 70 has 'Inconsistency' = 1 (not higher than 2)

The respondents with 'Inconsistency' higher than the average 'Inconsistency' of the 'Junior' group (2) are:

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents are in a group where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score for that same group?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'System_Complexity' and 'Ease_of_Use' scores for each group, and then identify the groups where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score. Finally, we will list the respondents who belong to those groups.

Here are the steps and calculations:

1. **Calculate Average Scores for Each Group:**

   - **Group A:**
     - Respondents: 35, 11
     - System_Complexity: (5 + 1) / 2 = 3
     - Ease_of_Use: (1 + 5) / 2 = 3
   - **Group B:**
     - Respondents: 44, 3
     - System_Complexity: (2 + 1) / 2 = 1.5
     - Ease_of_Use: (5 + 3) / 2 = 4
   - **Group C:**
     - Respondents: 54, 63, 33, 39, 62
     - System_Complexity: (1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1) / 5 = 1.6
     - Ease_of_Use: (5 + 5 + 5 + 1 + 5) / 5 = 4.2
   - **Group D:**
     - Respondents: 10
     - System_Complexity: 1
     - Ease_of_Use: 4

2. **Identify Groups with Higher Average 'System_Complexity' than 'Ease_of_Use':**

   - From the calculations, only **Group A** has an equal average score, but no group has a higher average 'System_Complexity' score than 'Ease_of_Use' score. However, since the task asks for groups where 'System_Complexity' is higher, and none of the groups meet this criterion, we look for the group with the closest or a unique condition. Since Group A is the only one with equal scores, it's worth noting but does not meet the ""higher"" criterion.

3. **List Respondents in Identified Groups:**

   - Since no group has a higher average 'System_Complexity' score than 'Ease_of_Use' score, the list of respondents that meet the task's condition is empty.

The final answer is: $\boxed{35, 11}$",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents whose total positive usability score ('Ease_of_Use' + 'Integration_of_Functions') is lower than the average for all respondents in the 'Senior' group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average total positive usability score for the 'Senior' group, and then identify respondents whose score is lower than this average.

1. **Identify 'Senior' respondents and their scores:**
   - From the schema, 'Senior' corresponds to option A in the 'Group' question.
   - We find respondents with 'Group' answer as 'A' (case-insensitive) and calculate their 'Ease_of_Use' + 'Integration_of_Functions' scores.

2. **Calculate the average score for 'Senior' respondents:**
   - Sum up all the 'Ease_of_Use' + 'Integration_of_Functions' scores for 'Senior' respondents.
   - Divide by the number of 'Senior' respondents to get the average.

3. **List all respondents with a lower score than the 'Senior' average:**
   - Calculate 'Ease_of_Use' + 'Integration_of_Functions' for each respondent.
   - Compare each respondent's score to the 'Senior' average, listing those with a lower score.

**Step 1 & 2: Calculate 'Senior' average**

- Respondent 52: 'Ease_of_Use' = 4, 'Integration_of_Functions' = 4, Total = 8
- Respondent 6: 'Ease_of_Use' = 4, 'Integration_of_Functions' = 5, Total = 9
- Respondent 76: 'Ease_of_Use' = 5, 'Integration_of_Functions' = 4, Total = 9
- Respondent 67: 'Ease_of_Use' = 5, 'Integration_of_Functions' = 5, Total = 10

Sum of scores for 'Senior' = 8 + 9 + 9 + 10 = 36
Number of 'Senior' respondents = 4
Average for 'Senior' = 36 / 4 = 9

**Step 3: Identify respondents with a lower score**

- Respondent 10: 'Ease_of_Use' = 4, 'Integration_of_Functions' = 5, Total = 9 (Equal to average, not lower)
- Respondent 52: Already counted in 'Senior' group
- Respondent 6: Already counted in 'Senior' group
- Respondent 76: Already counted in 'Senior' group
- Respondent 30: 'Ease_of_Use' = 5, 'Integration_of_Functions' = 5, Total = 10 (Higher than average)
- Respondent 82: 'Ease_of_Use' = 4, 'Integration_of_Functions' = 4, Total = 8 (Lower than average)
- Respondent 67: Already counted in 'Senior' group
- Respondent 20: 'Ease_of_Use' = 5, 'Integration_of_Functions' = 4, Total = 9 (Equal to average, not lower)

Respondents with a total positive usability score lower than the 'Senior' average are:

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents are in a group where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score for that same group?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'System_Complexity' and 'Ease_of_Use' scores for each group. Then, we identify the groups where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score. Finally, we list the respondents who belong to those groups.

From the provided data, we can calculate the averages as follows:

1. **Group A**:
   - System_Complexity: (1 + 2 + 1 + 1) / 4 = 5 / 4 = 1.25
   - Ease_of_Use: (1 + 4 + 5 + 5) / 4 = 15 / 4 = 3.75
   - Since 1.25 < 3.75, Group A does not meet the criteria.

2. **Group B**:
   - System_Complexity: (2 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 4 / 3 = 1.3333
   - Ease_of_Use: (5 + 5 + 5) / 3 = 15 / 3 = 5
   - Since 1.3333 < 5, Group B does not meet the criteria.

3. **Group C**:
   - System_Complexity: (3 + 1 + 1 + 1) / 4 = 6 / 4 = 1.5
   - Ease_of_Use: (1 + 5 + 5 + 5) / 4 = 16 / 4 = 4
   - Since 1.5 < 4, Group C does not meet the criteria.

4. **Group D**:
   - System_Complexity: (1 + 1) / 2 = 2 / 2 = 1
   - Ease_of_Use: (5 + 5) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5
   - Since 1 < 5, Group D does not meet the criteria.

However, upon re-examining the calculations and the task, it seems there was an oversight in the interpretation of the results. Let's correct the approach by directly comparing the scores within each group and then identifying the groups where the 'System_Complexity' score exceeds the 'Ease_of_Use' score on average.

Given the corrected understanding of the task, we should directly compare the average scores for 'System_Complexity' and 'Ease_of_Use' within each group and identify any group where 'System_Complexity' is higher. 

Upon reviewing the initial analysis, it appears there was a misunderstanding in the comparison process. The correct step involves calculating the averages correctly and then comparing them. However, the provided calculations do not correctly identify a group where 'System_Complexity' is higher than 'Ease_of_Use' because the initial assessment already concluded that no group meets this criterion based on the calculated averages.

To accurately answer the task based on the provided data and the requirement to follow the format to the letter, we must acknowledge that the initial analysis did not correctly identify any group meeting the specified condition due to the nature of the calculated averages. 

Given this, the correct response, following the format and the analysis provided, should reflect the outcome of the comparison. Since no group had a higher average 'System_Complexity' score than 'Ease_of_Use' score based on the calculations, the task's specific condition was not met in the provided data analysis.

The final answer is: $\boxed{9, 33, 50, 51}$",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents whose total positive usability score ('Ease_of_Use' + 'Integration_of_Functions') is lower than the average for all respondents in the 'Senior' group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average total positive usability score for the 'Senior' group, and then identify all respondents whose score is lower than this average.

1. **Identify 'Senior' respondents and their scores:**
   - From the schema, 'Senior' corresponds to option A in the 'Group' question.
   - We find respondents with 'Group' answer as 'A' (case-insensitive) and calculate their 'Ease_of_Use' + 'Integration_of_Functions' scores.

2. **Calculate the average score for 'Senior' respondents:**
   - Respondent '72' has scores: Ease_of_Use = 5, Integration_of_Functions = 5. Total = 10.
   - Respondent '65' has scores: Ease_of_Use = 5, Integration_of_Functions = 2. Total = 7.
   - The sum of their scores is 10 + 7 = 17.
   - The average score for 'Senior' respondents is 17 / 2 = 8.5.

3. **Identify respondents with a total score lower than the 'Senior' average (8.5):**
   - We calculate the total score for each respondent and compare it to 8.5.

Respondent calculations:
- '71': 5 (Ease_of_Use) + 4 (Integration_of_Functions) = 9
- '41': 5 + 5 = 10
- '17': 5 + 5 = 10
- '72': Already calculated as 10
- '69': 5 + 5 = 10
- '39': 1 + 5 = 6
- '65': Already calculated as 7
- '25': 3 + 3 = 6

**Respondents with scores lower than 8.5:**
- '39' with a score of 6
- '65' with a score of 7
- '25' with a score of 6

Thus, the respondents whose total positive usability score is lower than the average for all respondents in the 'Senior' group are **39, 65, 25**.",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents are in a group where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score for that same group?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'System_Complexity' and 'Ease_of_Use' scores for each group. Then, we identify the groups where the average 'System_Complexity' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score. Finally, we list the respondents who belong to those groups.

Let's calculate the averages for each group based on the provided data:

1. **Group A**:
   - Respondent 42: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
   - Respondent 6: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 4
   - Average System_Complexity = (1 + 1) / 2 = 1
   - Average Ease_of_Use = (5 + 4) / 2 = 4.5
   - Since 1 < 4.5, Group A does not meet the criteria.

2. **Group B**:
   - Respondent 66: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
   - Respondent 36: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
   - Average System_Complexity = (1 + 1) / 2 = 1
   - Average Ease_of_Use = (5 + 5) / 2 = 5
   - Since 1 < 5, Group B does not meet the criteria.

3. **Group C**:
   - Respondent 9: System_Complexity = 3, Ease_of_Use = 1
   - Respondent 53: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
   - Respondent 88: System_Complexity = 2, Ease_of_Use = 5
   - Average System_Complexity = (3 + 1 + 2) / 3 = 2
   - Average Ease_of_Use = (1 + 5 + 5) / 3 = 3.67
   - Since 2 < 3.67, Group C does not meet the criteria.

4. **Group D**:
   - Respondent 45: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 4
   - Respondent 15: System_Complexity = 2, Ease_of_Use = 4
   - Respondent 71: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
   - Respondent 7: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5
   - Average System_Complexity = (1 + 2 + 1 + 1) / 4 = 1.25
   - Average Ease_of_Use = (4 + 4 + 5 + 5) / 4 = 4.5
   - Since 1.25 < 4.5, Group D does not meet the criteria.

However, upon reviewing the calculations, it appears there was an oversight in the interpretation of the results. Let's correct the approach by directly comparing the averages calculated for each group and identifying any group where the average 'System_Complexity' score exceeds the average 'Ease_of_Use' score, which upon the initial review, seems not to be the case for any group based on the provided calculations. 

Given the corrected understanding and calculation:
- None of the groups have an average 'System_Complexity' score higher than their average 'Ease_of_Use' score based on the provided data and calculations.

Thus, the correct answer, following the precise format and instructions given, should reflect that no respondents meet the specified condition based on the calculations provided. However, the task requires identifying respondents in groups where the condition is met, and since none of the groups meet this condition according to the calculations, the list of respondents would be empty. 

The final answer is: $\boxed{9, 88}$",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'Inconsistency' is higher than the average 'Inconsistency' for the 'Middle' group.
</task>","To find the respondents whose 'Inconsistency' is higher than the average 'Inconsistency' for the 'Middle' group, we first need to calculate the average 'Inconsistency' for the 'Middle' group.

From the provided data, the respondents in the 'Middle' group are those with answer ""C"" for the question ""Group"". These are respondents with IDs 82 and 43.

For respondent 82, the 'Inconsistency' score is 1.
For respondent 43, the 'Inconsistency' score is 1.

The average 'Inconsistency' for the 'Middle' group is (1 + 1) / 2 = 1.

Now, we need to find all respondents whose 'Inconsistency' score is higher than 1.

From the data:
- Respondent 64 has an 'Inconsistency' score of 4.
- Respondent 35 has an 'Inconsistency' score of 5.
- Respondent 47 has an 'Inconsistency' score of 1.
- Respondent 32 has an 'Inconsistency' score of 1.
- Respondent 89 has an 'Inconsistency' score of 3.
- Respondent 61 has an 'Inconsistency' score of 4.
- Respondent 11 has an 'Inconsistency' score of 1.

The respondents with 'Inconsistency' scores higher than the average 'Inconsistency' for the 'Middle' group (1) are:
64, 35, 89, 61.

These respondents have 'Inconsistency' scores higher than the average for the 'Middle' group.",False
