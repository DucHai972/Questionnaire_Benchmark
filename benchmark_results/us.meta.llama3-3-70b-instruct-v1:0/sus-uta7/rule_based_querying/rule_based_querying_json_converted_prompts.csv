<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
List all respondents from the 'Junior' group whose 'Confidence_in_Use' is exactly 4.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify respondents from the 'Junior' group.
2. Filter those respondents to only include those whose 'Confidence_in_Use' score is exactly 4.

From the 'questions' section, we understand that the 'Group' field is a multiple-choice question with options A. Senior, B. Junior, C. Middle, D. Intern. Therefore, respondents from the 'Junior' group will have answered ""B"" (case-insensitive) to the 'Group' question.

Now, let's examine the 'responses' section to find respondents who match both criteria:

- Respondent 31: Group = D (Intern), Confidence_in_Use = 1. Does not match.
- Respondent 76: Group = A (Senior), Confidence_in_Use = 5. Does not match.
- Respondent 70: Group = C (Middle), Confidence_in_Use = 5. Does not match.
- Respondent 17: Group = C (Middle), Confidence_in_Use = 5. Does not match.
- Respondent 48: Group = D (Intern), Confidence_in_Use = 5. Does not match.
- Respondent 78: Group = D (Intern), Confidence_in_Use = 2. Does not match.
- Respondent 61: Group = B (Junior), Confidence_in_Use = 1. Does not match because Confidence_in_Use is not 4.
- Respondent 81: Group = A (Senior), Confidence_in_Use = 4. Does not match because the respondent is not from the 'Junior' group.

However, upon re-examining the provided data, it appears there was an oversight in the initial analysis regarding the specific request for respondents with a 'Confidence_in_Use' score of exactly 4 from the 'Junior' group. The correct respondent that matches the 'Junior' group criterion (Group = B) and has a 'Confidence_in_Use' score of exactly 4 is actually not listed in the initial analysis due to an error in matching the criteria correctly.

The correct match based on the provided data is:
- Respondent 81 does not match because they are not in the 'Junior' group.
- The only respondent in the 'Junior' group (B) is Respondent 61, but their 'Confidence_in_Use' score is 1, not 4.

Given the data provided and correcting the analysis:
There are no respondents in the 'Junior' group with a 'Confidence_in_Use' score of exactly 4 based on the information given. 

The final answer is: $\boxed{81}$",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents from the 'Intern' group whose 'Need_for_Technical_Support' is exactly 1.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify respondents from the 'Intern' group.
2. Filter those who have a 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score of exactly 1.

From the provided data, the 'Intern' group is represented by the letter ""D"" in the 'Group' field. We will look for respondents with ""D"" as their group and a 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score of ""1"".

Looking through the responses:

- Respondent ""31"" is from group ""D"" and has a 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score of ""2"", which does not match our criteria.
- No other respondents are from group ""D"" with a 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score of ""1"".

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents from the 'Middle' group whose 'System_Complexity' is exactly 4.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the respondents from the 'Middle' group.
2. Filter those respondents to only include those whose 'System_Complexity' is exactly 4.

From the provided data, the 'Middle' group corresponds to the option ""C"" in the 'Group' question.

Let's examine the responses:

- Respondent ""80"" is from group ""A"", not ""C"".
- Respondent ""33"" is from group ""C"", which is the 'Middle' group, but their 'System_Complexity' is ""1"", not ""4"".
- Respondent ""46"" is from group ""A"", not ""C"".
- Respondent ""89"" is from group ""A"", not ""C"".
- Respondent ""84"" is from group ""D"", not ""C"".
- Respondent ""68"" is from group ""B"", not ""C"".

None of the respondents from the 'Middle' group (group ""C"") have a 'System_Complexity' of exactly ""4"". Therefore, the list of respondents that meet the criteria is empty.

Since there are no respondents that fit the given criteria, the answer is simply that there are no such respondents. However, following the format for providing a list of names or IDs as requested:

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents from the 'Senior' group whose 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' is exactly 1.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the 'Senior' group respondents.
2. Filter those respondents whose 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score is exactly 1.

From the provided 'questions' schema, we understand that the 'Group' field is a multiple-choice question with options A. Senior, B. Junior, C. Middle, D. Intern. Therefore, respondents belonging to the 'Senior' group will have 'A' (case-insensitive) as their answer for the 'Group' field.

Now, let's analyze the 'responses' section to find respondents who match our criteria:

1. Respondent ""42"" has ""Group"" = ""A"" (which corresponds to 'Senior') and ""Need_to_Learn_Before_Use"" = ""3"", which does not match our criteria.
2. Respondent ""20"" has ""Group"" = ""C"", which does not correspond to 'Senior', so this respondent does not match our criteria.
3. Respondent ""51"" has ""Group"" = ""C"", which does not correspond to 'Senior', so this respondent does not match our criteria.
4. Respondent ""84"" has ""Group"" = ""D"", which does not correspond to 'Senior', so this respondent does not match our criteria.
5. Respondent ""7"" has ""Group"" = ""D"", which does not correspond to 'Senior', so this respondent does not match our criteria.

However, upon re-examining the provided data, it's clear that only respondent ""42"" is from the 'Senior' group, but their 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score is 3, not 1. Thus, there are no respondents from the 'Senior' group with a 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score of exactly 1 among the given responses.

The final answer is: $\boxed{42}$",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'Inconsistency' score is between 1 and 3.
</task>","To find all respondents whose 'Inconsistency' score is between 1 and 3, we need to examine the 'responses' section of the data and look for the 'Inconsistency' scores that fall within this range.

From the provided data:

- Respondent ""30"" has an 'Inconsistency' score of ""1"".
- Respondent ""48"" has an 'Inconsistency' score of ""1"".
- Respondent ""17"" has an 'Inconsistency' score of ""1"".
- Respondent ""6"" has an 'Inconsistency' score of ""1"".
- Respondent ""49"" has an 'Inconsistency' score of ""4"", which is outside the specified range.
- Respondent ""25"" has an 'Inconsistency' score of ""4"", which is also outside the specified range.

Therefore, the respondents whose 'Inconsistency' score is between 1 and 3 (inclusive) are:

30, 48, 17, 6

These respondents all have scores of 1, which falls within the specified range. Since none of the respondents have scores of 2 or 3, the list only includes those with a score of 1.",False

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'System_Complexity' score is between 1 and 4.
</task>","To find all respondents whose 'System_Complexity' score is between 1 and 4, we need to examine each response in the 'responses' section and check the 'System_Complexity' score.

From the provided data:

- Respondent ""60"" has a 'System_Complexity' score of ""1"".
- Respondent ""79"" has a 'System_Complexity' score of ""1"".
- Respondent ""48"" has a 'System_Complexity' score of ""1"".
- Respondent ""35"" has a 'System_Complexity' score of ""5"", which is outside the specified range.
- Respondent ""18"" has a 'System_Complexity' score of ""1"".
- Respondent ""24"" has a 'System_Complexity' score of ""5"", which is outside the specified range.

Therefore, the respondents whose 'System_Complexity' score is between 1 and 4 are:

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score is between 1 and 2.
</task>","To find all respondents whose 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score is between 1 and 2, we need to look at the 'responses' section of the data and identify the respondents with scores of 1 or 2 for the 'Need_for_Technical_Support' question.

From the data provided:

- Respondent ""47"" has a 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score of ""1"".
- Respondent ""62"" has a 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score of ""1"".
- Respondent ""30"" has a 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score of ""1"".
- Respondent ""58"" has a 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score of ""1"".
- Respondent ""37"" has a 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score of ""2"".

Therefore, the respondents whose 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score is between 1 and 2 (inclusive) are ""47"", ""62"", ""30"", ""58"", and ""37"".

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'Cumbersome_to_Use' score is between 1 and 3.
</task>","To find all respondents whose 'Cumbersome_to_Use' score is between 1 and 3, we need to analyze the 'responses' section of the given data.

From the 'responses' section, we can see that the following respondents have a 'Cumbersome_to_Use' score between 1 and 3:

- Respondent ""67"" has a score of ""1"".
- Respondent ""54"" has a score of ""1"".
- Respondent ""39"" has a score of ""4"", which is outside the specified range.
- Respondent ""47"" has a score of ""1"".
- Respondent ""38"" has a score of ""1"".

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'System_Complexity' score is between 1 and 3.
</task>","To find all respondents whose 'System_Complexity' score is between 1 and 3, we need to analyze the 'responses' section of the given data. 

The 'System_Complexity' question is scored on a Likert scale of 1-5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" and 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" to the statement ""I found the system unnecessarily complex.""

We will go through each respondent's answer and check if their 'System_Complexity' score falls between 1 and 3 (inclusive).

Respondents with scores between 1 and 3 are:
- 87: 2
- 6: 1
- 67: 1
- 16: 1
- 66: 1
- 51: 1
- 45: 1
- 38: 1
- 75: 1
- 19: 1
- 26: 2
- 68: 3

So, the respondents whose 'System_Complexity' score is between 1 and 3 are: 87, 6, 67, 16, 66, 26, 51, 45, 68, 38, 75, 19.

The final answer is: 87, 6, 67, 16, 66, 26, 51, 45, 68, 38, 75, 19.",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents from the 'Senior' group whose 'Need_for_Technical_Support' is exactly 1.
</task>","To solve this task, I will follow the instructions provided.


First, I need to identify the respondents from the 'Senior' group. According to the 'questions' schema, the 'Group' field is a multiple-choice question with options A. Senior, B. Junior, C. Middle, and D. Intern. Therefore, I will look for respondents with 'Group' answer 'A' (since 'A' corresponds to 'Senior').


Next, I need to find the respondents whose 'Need_for_Technical_Support' is exactly 1. This means I will look for answers with the value '1' in the 'Need_for_Technical_Support' field.


Now, let's analyze the 'responses' section:


- Respondent 38: Group = A (Senior), Need_for_Technical_Support = 3. Does not match.
- Respondent 11: Group = A (Senior), Need_for_Technical_Support = 5. Does not match.
- Respondent 3: Group = B (Junior), Need_for_Technical_Support = 1. Does not match because not Senior.
- Respondent 76: Group = A (Senior), Need_for_Technical_Support = 1. Matches.
- Respondent 40: Group = C (Middle), Need_for_Technical_Support = 1. Does not match because not Senior.
- Respondent 55: Group = A (Senior), Need_for_Technical_Support = 1. Matches.
- Respondent 49: Group = D (Intern), Need_for_Technical_Support = 4. Does not match.
- Respondent 68: Group = B (Junior), Need_for_Technical_Support = 4. Does not match because not Senior.
- Respondent 46: Group = A (Senior), Need_for_Technical_Support = 2. Does not match.


The respondents from the 'Senior' group whose 'Need_for_Technical_Support' is exactly 1 are 76 and 55.


The final answer is: 76, 55",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents from the 'Middle' group whose 'Frequent_Usage' is exactly 3.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify respondents from the 'Middle' group.
2. Filter those respondents to only include those whose 'Frequent_Usage' is exactly 3.

From the provided data, the 'Middle' group corresponds to the letter ""C"" in the 'Group' question.

Now, let's examine each respondent's data:

- Respondent ""50"" is in group ""C"" but has a 'Frequent_Usage' of ""1"".
- Respondent ""75"" is in group ""A"", not ""C"".
- Respondent ""24"" is in group ""C"" but has a 'Frequent_Usage' of ""2"".
- Respondent ""28"" is in group ""A"", not ""C"".
- Respondent ""22"" is in group ""C"" but has a 'Frequent_Usage' of ""1"".
- Respondent ""25"" is in group ""D"", not ""C"", and has a 'Frequent_Usage' of ""3"", but since they are not in the 'Middle' group, they do not meet the criteria.
- Respondent ""86"" is in group ""A"", not ""C"".

None of the respondents in the 'Middle' group (those with ""C"" as their group answer) have a 'Frequent_Usage' of exactly 3. Therefore, there are no respondents that meet the specified criteria.

Since there are no matching respondents, the list is empty.",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents from the 'Senior' group whose 'Ease_of_Use' is exactly 3.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify respondents from the 'Senior' group.
2. Filter those respondents to only include ones whose 'Ease_of_Use' score is exactly 3.

From the provided 'questions' schema, we understand that the 'Group' field is a multiple-choice question with options A. Senior, B. Junior, C. Middle, D. Intern. Therefore, respondents who belong to the 'Senior' group will have their 'Group' answer as ""A"".

Now, let's examine the 'responses' section to find respondents who match both conditions:

1. Belong to the 'Senior' group (Group = ""A"").
2. Have an 'Ease_of_Use' score of exactly 3.

Upon reviewing the responses:

- Respondent ""49"" does not belong to the 'Senior' group (Group = ""D"").
- Respondent ""2"" does not belong to the 'Senior' group (Group = ""C"") and does not have an 'Ease_of_Use' score of 3 (Ease_of_Use = ""4"").
- Respondent ""28"" belongs to the 'Senior' group (Group = ""A"") but does not have an 'Ease_of_Use' score of 3 (Ease_of_Use = ""5"").
- Respondent ""40"" does not belong to the 'Senior' group (Group = ""C"").
- Respondent ""82"" does not belong to the 'Senior' group (Group = ""C"") and does not have an 'Ease_of_Use' score of 3 (Ease_of_Use = ""4"").
- Respondent ""61"" does not belong to the 'Senior' group (Group = ""B"") and does not have an 'Ease_of_Use' score of 3 (Ease_of_Use = ""2"").

None of the provided respondents match both conditions of being in the 'Senior' group and having an 'Ease_of_Use' score of exactly 3.

<task>
List all respondents whose 'System_Complexity' score is greater than their 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to compare the 'System_Complexity' score with the 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score for each respondent and list those where 'System_Complexity' is greater.

Let's analyze the responses:

1. Respondent ""26"": 
   - 'System_Complexity' score = 2
   - 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score = 2
   Since 2 is not greater than 2, respondent ""26"" does not meet the criteria.

2. Respondent ""85"": 
   - 'System_Complexity' score = 1
   - 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score = 1
   Since 1 is not greater than 1, respondent ""85"" does not meet the criteria.

3. Respondent ""27"": 
   - 'System_Complexity' score = 4
   - 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score = 4
   Since 4 is not greater than 4, respondent ""27"" does not meet the criteria.

4. Respondent ""56"": 
   - 'System_Complexity' score = 2
   - 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score = 1
   Since 2 is greater than 1, respondent ""56"" meets the criteria.

5. Respondent ""77"": 
   - 'System_Complexity' score = 1
   - 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score = 1
   Since 1 is not greater than 1, respondent ""77"" does not meet the criteria.

Based on the analysis, the respondents whose 'System_Complexity' score is greater than their 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score are:

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents from the 'Junior' group have a 'System_Complexity' of 4 or more and a 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' of less than 4?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to analyze the 'responses' section of the data and filter the respondents based on the given conditions.


After analyzing the data, we can see that there are no respondents from the 'Junior' group who have a 'System_Complexity' of 4 or more and a 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' of less than 4.


The 'Junior' group corresponds to the option ""B"" in the 'Group' field. We can see that respondent ""23"" is from the 'Junior' group, but their 'System_Complexity' is 1, which is less than 4.


Therefore, the answer is:

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondents from the 'Middle' group have a 'Cumbersome_to_Use' of 4 or more and a 'Ease_of_Use' of less than 3?
</task>","To solve this task, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify respondents from the 'Middle' group.
2. Filter those who have a 'Cumbersome_to_Use' score of 4 or more.
3. Further filter to include only those with an 'Ease_of_Use' score of less than 3.

From the provided data, we can see that the 'Middle' group corresponds to the letter ""C"" in the 'Group' question.

Let's analyze the responses:

- Respondent ""37"" is in group ""C"" (Middle), has a 'Cumbersome_to_Use' score of 1 (which is less than 4), and an 'Ease_of_Use' score of 5 (which is more than 3). So, ""37"" does not meet the criteria.
- Respondent ""51"" is in group ""C"" (Middle), has a 'Cumbersome_to_Use' score of 1 (which is less than 4), and an 'Ease_of_Use' score of 5 (which is more than 3). So, ""51"" does not meet the criteria.
- Respondent ""54"" is in group ""C"" (Middle), has a 'Cumbersome_to_Use' score of 1 (which is less than 4), and an 'Ease_of_Use' score of 5 (which is more than 3). So, ""54"" does not meet the criteria.

None of the respondents from the 'Middle' group meet the specified conditions. Therefore, the list of respondents who meet the criteria is empty.",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents whose 'System_Complexity' score is greater than their 'Ease_of_Use' score.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to compare the 'System_Complexity' score with the 'Ease_of_Use' score for each respondent and list those where 'System_Complexity' is greater.

From the provided data:

1. Respondent ""2"": System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 4. System_Complexity is not greater.
2. Respondent ""61"": System_Complexity = 5, Ease_of_Use = 2. System_Complexity is greater.
3. Respondent ""15"": System_Complexity = 2, Ease_of_Use = 4. System_Complexity is not greater.
4. Respondent ""51"": System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5. System_Complexity is not greater.
5. Respondent ""19"": System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5. System_Complexity is not greater.
6. Respondent ""88"": System_Complexity = 2, Ease_of_Use = 5. System_Complexity is not greater.
7. Respondent ""6"": System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 4. System_Complexity is not greater.

9. Respondent ""69"": System_Complexity = 4, Ease_of_Use = 5. System_Complexity is not greater.

Only respondent ""61"" has a 'System_Complexity' score greater than their 'Ease_of_Use' score.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents from the 'Junior' group have a 'Inconsistency' of 4 or more and a 'Confidence_in_Use' of less than 3?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to analyze the 'responses' section of the data and filter the respondents based on the given conditions.


After analyzing the data, we can see that there are two respondents from the 'Junior' group: ""36"" and ""69"".


Respondent ""36"" has an 'Inconsistency' score of 1, which is less than 4, so they do not meet the condition.


Respondent ""69"" has an 'Inconsistency' score of 5, which is 4 or more, and a 'Confidence_in_Use' score of 4, which is not less than 3, so they do not meet the condition either.


Since none of the respondents from the 'Junior' group meet the conditions, the answer is:


There are no respondents that meet the given conditions.",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose total score for 'Inconsistency' and 'Confidence_in_Use' is less than 6.
</task>","To find all respondents whose total score for 'Inconsistency' and 'Confidence_in_Use' is less than 6, we need to go through each respondent's answers in the 'responses' section and calculate the sum of their scores for these two questions.

Here are the calculations for each respondent:

1. Respondent ""68"": Inconsistency = 2, Confidence_in_Use = 4, Total = 6
2. Respondent ""46"": Inconsistency = 2, Confidence_in_Use = 3, Total = 5
3. Respondent ""75"": Inconsistency = 4, Confidence_in_Use = 4, Total = 8
4. Respondent ""4"": Inconsistency = 1, Confidence_in_Use = 5, Total = 6
5. Respondent ""30"": Inconsistency = 1, Confidence_in_Use = 5, Total = 6
6. Respondent ""50"": Inconsistency = 2, Confidence_in_Use = 4, Total = 6
7. Respondent ""47"": Inconsistency = 1, Confidence_in_Use = 5, Total = 6
8. Respondent ""9"": Inconsistency = 5, Confidence_in_Use = 2, Total = 7
9. Respondent ""55"": Inconsistency = 1, Confidence_in_Use = 2, Total = 3
10. Respondent ""40"": Inconsistency = 1, Confidence_in_Use = 5, Total = 6
11. Respondent ""44"": Inconsistency = 1, Confidence_in_Use = 1, Total = 2
12. Respondent ""13"": Inconsistency = 1, Confidence_in_Use = 5, Total = 6

The respondents with a total score less than 6 for 'Inconsistency' and 'Confidence_in_Use' are:
46, 55, 44

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents whose 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score is greater than their 'Confidence_in_Use' score.
</task>","To solve this task, I will iterate through each respondent's answers in the 'responses' section and compare their 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score with their 'Confidence_in_Use' score. I will list the respondents whose 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score is greater than their 'Confidence_in_Use' score.

After analyzing the data, I found the following respondents whose 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score is greater than their 'Confidence_in_Use' score:

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Find all respondents whose total score for 'Inconsistency' and 'Frequent_Usage' is less than 4.
</task>","To find all respondents whose total score for 'Inconsistency' and 'Frequent_Usage' is less than 4, we need to calculate the sum of these two scores for each respondent and then identify those with a total score less than 4.


## Step 1: Calculate the total score for 'Inconsistency' and 'Frequent_Usage' for each respondent.
We will iterate through each respondent's answers and sum the scores for 'Inconsistency' and 'Frequent_Usage'.


## Step 2: Identify respondents with a total score less than 4.
After calculating the total score for each respondent, we will identify those whose total score is less than 4.


## Step 3: List the respondents who meet the condition.
Based on the provided data, we calculate the total score for each respondent:
- Respondent 43: Inconsistency (1) + Frequent_Usage (3) = 4
- Respondent 8: Inconsistency (1) + Frequent_Usage (2) = 3
- Respondent 3: Inconsistency (4) + Frequent_Usage (2) = 6
- Respondent 37: Inconsistency (1) + Frequent_Usage (4) = 5
- Respondent 11: Inconsistency (1) + Frequent_Usage (1) = 2
- Respondent 1: Inconsistency (1) + Frequent_Usage (3) = 4
- Respondent 65: Inconsistency (4) + Frequent_Usage (2) = 6
- Respondent 81: Inconsistency (2) + Frequent_Usage (1) = 3
- Respondent 23: Inconsistency (2) + Frequent_Usage (4) = 6
- Respondent 32: Inconsistency (1) + Frequent_Usage (5) = 6


## Step 4: Determine the final list of respondents.
From the calculations, the respondents with a total score less than 4 for 'Inconsistency' and 'Frequent_Usage' are:
- Respondent 8 (total score = 3)
- Respondent 11 (total score = 2)
- Respondent 81 (total score = 3)


The final answer is: $\boxed{8, 11, 81}$",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Find all respondents whose total score for 'Need_for_Technical_Support' and 'Ease_of_Learning' is less than 4.
</task>","To find all respondents whose total score for 'Need_for_Technical_Support' and 'Ease_of_Learning' is less than 4, we need to calculate the sum of these two scores for each respondent and then identify those with a sum less than 4.

Based on the provided data:

1. Respondent ""88"": 'Need_for_Technical_Support' = 2, 'Ease_of_Learning' = 4, Total = 6
2. Respondent ""78"": 'Need_for_Technical_Support' = 4, 'Ease_of_Learning' = 3, Total = 7
3. Respondent ""12"": 'Need_for_Technical_Support' = 2, 'Ease_of_Learning' = 5, Total = 7
4. Respondent ""80"": 'Need_for_Technical_Support' = 3, 'Ease_of_Learning' = 5, Total = 8
5. Respondent ""86"": 'Need_for_Technical_Support' = 5, 'Ease_of_Learning' = 5, Total = 10
6. Respondent ""82"": 'Need_for_Technical_Support' = 1, 'Ease_of_Learning' = 5, Total = 6
7. Respondent ""66"": 'Need_for_Technical_Support' = 1, 'Ease_of_Learning' = 5, Total = 6
8. Respondent ""5"": 'Need_for_Technical_Support' = 1, 'Ease_of_Learning' = 5, Total = 6
9. Respondent ""81"": 'Need_for_Technical_Support' = 2, 'Ease_of_Learning' = 5, Total = 7
10. Respondent ""48"": 'Need_for_Technical_Support' = 1, 'Ease_of_Learning' = 5, Total = 6

None of the respondents have a total score for 'Need_for_Technical_Support' and 'Ease_of_Learning' that is less than 4.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents from the 'Senior' group have a 'Confidence_in_Use' of 3 or more and a 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' of less than 4?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to analyze the 'responses' section of the data and filter the respondents based on the given conditions.


The condition for 'Group' is that the respondent must be from the 'Senior' group, which corresponds to the letter 'A' in the schema.


The condition for 'Confidence_in_Use' is that the score must be 3 or more.


The condition for 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' is that the score must be less than 4.


After analyzing the data, we find that respondent ""55"" is from the 'Senior' group (Group 'A'), but their 'Confidence_in_Use' score is 2, which does not meet the condition.


Respondent ""6"" is also from the 'Senior' group (Group 'A'), and their 'Confidence_in_Use' score is 5, which meets the condition. Additionally, their 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score is 1, which is less than 4 and meets the condition.


Therefore, the respondent from the 'Senior' group who meets the given conditions is:

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").

Find all respondents whose total score for 'Cumbersome_to_Use' and 'Integration_of_Functions' is less than 6.
</task>","To find all respondents whose total score for 'Cumbersome_to_Use' and 'Integration_of_Functions' is less than 6, we need to analyze each respondent's answers in the 'responses' section.

Here are the calculations for each respondent:

1. Respondent 27: Cumbersome_to_Use = 5, Integration_of_Functions = 2, Total = 7 (not less than 6)
2. Respondent 34: Cumbersome_to_Use = 1, Integration_of_Functions = 4, Total = 5 (less than 6)
3. Respondent 50: Cumbersome_to_Use = 2, Integration_of_Functions = 5, Total = 7 (not less than 6)
4. Respondent 4: Cumbersome_to_Use = 1, Integration_of_Functions = 3, Total = 4 (less than 6)
5. Respondent 25: Cumbersome_to_Use = 3, Integration_of_Functions = 3, Total = 6 (not less than 6)
6. Respondent 29: Cumbersome_to_Use = 1, Integration_of_Functions = 4, Total = 5 (less than 6)
7. Respondent 51: Cumbersome_to_Use = 1, Integration_of_Functions = 5, Total = 6 (not less than 6)
8. Respondent 73: Cumbersome_to_Use = 1, Integration_of_Functions = 4, Total = 5 (less than 6)
9. Respondent 1: Cumbersome_to_Use = 1, Integration_of_Functions = 5, Total = 6 (not less than 6)

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Find all respondents whose total score for 'Integration_of_Functions' and 'Inconsistency' is less than 6.
</task>","To find all respondents whose total score for 'Integration_of_Functions' and 'Inconsistency' is less than 6, we need to analyze each respondent's answers in the 'responses' section and calculate the sum of their scores for these two questions.

Here are the calculations for each respondent:

1. Respondent ""59"": Integration_of_Functions = 5, Inconsistency = 1, Total = 6
2. Respondent ""75"": Integration_of_Functions = 2, Inconsistency = 4, Total = 6
3. Respondent ""68"": Integration_of_Functions = 5, Inconsistency = 2, Total = 7
4. Respondent ""5"": Integration_of_Functions = 5, Inconsistency = 1, Total = 6
5. Respondent ""32"": Integration_of_Functions = 5, Inconsistency = 1, Total = 6
6. Respondent ""37"": Integration_of_Functions = 5, Inconsistency = 1, Total = 6
7. Respondent ""86"": Integration_of_Functions = 5, Inconsistency = 3, Total = 8
8. Respondent ""82"": Integration_of_Functions = 4, Inconsistency = 1, Total = 5
9. Respondent ""27"": Integration_of_Functions = 2, Inconsistency = 4, Total = 6
10. Respondent ""17"": Integration_of_Functions = 5, Inconsistency = 1, Total = 6

Based on these calculations, the only respondent whose total score for 'Integration_of_Functions' and 'Inconsistency' is less than 6 is:

82

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

Let's calculate the average 'Ease_of_Learning' for each group:

- Group A (Senior): Respondent 89 with a score of 5. Average = 5.
- Group B (Junior): Respondent 36 with a score of 5. Average = 5.
- Group C (Middle): Respondents 43 (score 3), 22 (score 4), 50 (score 4), 37 (score 5). Average = (3 + 4 + 4 + 5) / 4 = 16 / 4 = 4.
- Group D (Intern): Respondents 49 (score 4), 30 (score 5), 74 (score 5), 71 (score 5). Average = (4 + 5 + 5 + 5) / 4 = 19 / 4 = 4.75.

Now, let's identify the respondents whose 'Ease_of_Learning' score is greater than their group's average:

- Group A: None (since the average is 5 and the only respondent scored 5, which is not greater than the average).
- Group B: None (same reason as Group A).
- Group C: Respondent 37 with a score of 5 (since 5 > 4).
- Group D: Respondents 30 (score 5), 74 (score 5), 71 (score 5) (since 5 > 4.75).

Therefore, the respondents whose 'Ease_of_Learning' is greater than the average 'Ease_of_Learning' for their group are:

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondents have an 'Ease_of_Use' score that is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score for their group?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Ease_of_Use' score for each group and then identify the respondents whose 'Ease_of_Use' score exceeds this average for their respective group.

Given the data, let's calculate the average 'Ease_of_Use' score for each group:

1. **Group A (Senior)**: There are no respondents in Group A, so we cannot calculate an average.
2. **Group B (Junior)**:
   - Respondent 36: Ease_of_Use = 5
   - Respondent 32: Ease_of_Use = 5
   - Respondent 14: Ease_of_Use = 4
   - Average for Group B = (5 + 5 + 4) / 3 = 14 / 3 = 4.67
3. **Group C (Middle)**:
   - Respondent 82: Ease_of_Use = 4
   - Respondent 4: Ease_of_Use = 5
   - Respondent 87: Ease_of_Use = 3
   - Respondent 70: Ease_of_Use = 5
   - Average for Group C = (4 + 5 + 3 + 5) / 4 = 17 / 4 = 4.25
4. **Group D (Intern)**:
   - Respondent 15: Ease_of_Use = 4
   - Respondent 29: Ease_of_Use = 4
   - Respondent 18: Ease_of_Use = 4
   - Respondent 12: Ease_of_Use = 5
   - Average for Group D = (4 + 4 + 4 + 5) / 4 = 17 / 4 = 4.25

Now, let's identify the respondents whose 'Ease_of_Use' score is higher than the average for their group:

- **Group B**: Since the average is 4.67, only respondents with an Ease_of_Use score of 5 are above average. These are respondents 36 and 32.
- **Group C**: The average is 4.25, so respondents with an Ease_of_Use score of 5 are above average. These are respondents 4 and 70.
- **Group D**: The average is 4.25, so the respondent with an Ease_of_Use score of 5 is above average. This is respondent 12.

Therefore, the respondents with an 'Ease_of_Use' score higher than the average for their group are 36, 32, 4, 70, and 12.",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents have a total positive usability score ('Ease_of_Use' + 'Integration_of_Functions') that is lower than the average for all respondents in a different group?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average total positive usability score for each group, and then identify respondents whose score is lower than the average of a different group.

1. **Calculate Total Positive Usability Score for Each Respondent:**
   - This score is the sum of 'Ease_of_Use' and 'Integration_of_Functions' for each respondent.

2. **Calculate Average Total Positive Usability Score for Each Group:**
   - Group the respondents by their 'Group' answer.
   - For each group, calculate the average of the total positive usability scores.

3. **Identify Respondents with Scores Lower Than the Average of a Different Group:**
   - Compare each respondent's score with the average scores of all other groups.
   - List respondents whose score is lower than any of these averages.

Given the data:

### Step 1: Calculate Total Positive Usability Score for Each Respondent

| Respondent | Group | Ease_of_Use | Integration_of_Functions | Total Score |
|------------|-------|-------------|--------------------------|-------------|
| 5          | C     | 5           | 5                        | 10          |
| 37         | C     | 5           | 5                        | 10          |
| 90         | D     | 5           | 5                        | 10          |
| 19         | C     | 5           | 3                        | 8           |
| 60         | D     | 5           | 4                        | 9           |
| 48         | D     | 5           | 5                        | 10          |
| 86         | A     | 1           | 5                        | 6           |
| 13         | A     | 5           | 5                        | 10          |
| 59         | A     | 5           | 5                        | 10          |
| 77         | D     | 5           | 4                        | 9           |
| 64         | D     | 2           | 2                        | 4           |
| 78         | D     | 3           | 4                        | 7           |

### Step 2: Calculate Average Total Positive Usability Score for Each Group

- **Group A:** (6 + 10 + 10) / 3 = 26 / 3 = 8.67
- **Group C:** (10 + 10 + 8) / 3 = 28 / 3 = 9.33
- **Group D:** (10 + 9 + 10 + 9 + 4 + 7) / 6 = 49 / 6 = 8.17

### Step 3: Identify Respondents with Scores Lower Than the Average of a Different Group

- Respondents in Group A with scores lower than Group C's average (9.33): 86 (score 6)
- Respondents in Group C with scores lower than Group A's average (8.67): None
- Respondents in Group D with scores lower than Group A's average (8.67): 64 (score 4), 78 (score 7)
- Respondents in Group A with scores lower than Group D's average (8.17): 86 (score 6)
- Respondents in Group C with scores lower than Group D's average (8.17): 19 (score 8)
- Respondents in Group D with scores lower than Group C's average (9.33): 60 (score 9), 77 (score 9), 64 (score 4), 78 (score 7)

Thus, the respondents who have a total positive usability score lower than the average for all respondents in a different group are: 86, 19, 60, 77, 64, 78.

The final answer is: $\boxed{86, 19, 60, 77, 64, 78}$",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents whose 'Need_for_Technical_Support' is within 2 point of the highest 'Integration_of_Functions' for their group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to understand the 'questions' schema and the 'responses' data. The 'Need_for_Technical_Support' and 'Integration_of_Functions' are both Likert scale questions with scores ranging from 1 to 5. The 'Group' is a multiple-choice question with options A (Senior), B (Junior), C (Middle), and D (Intern).

Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. **Find the highest 'Integration_of_Functions' score for each group:**
   - For each group (A, B, C, D), find the maximum 'Integration_of_Functions' score.
   - Since the data provided does not explicitly state the group for each respondent in a way that can be directly compared, we'll have to infer based on the given responses.

2. **Identify respondents within 2 points of the highest 'Integration_of_Functions' for their group based on 'Need_for_Technical_Support':**
   - For each group, find respondents whose 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score is within 2 points of the highest 'Integration_of_Functions' score found in step 1.

Given the data:

- **Group A (Senior):** Respondent 67 has 'Integration_of_Functions' = 5, which is the highest possible score. The 'Need_for_Technical_Support' for this group that is within 2 points of 5 (meaning 3, 4, or 5) is respondent 67 with a score of 1, which does not meet the criteria. However, since 67's score is 1, we look for scores that are within 2 points of 5, which means scores 3, 4, or 5. There are no respondents in Group A with 'Need_for_Technical_Support' scores of 3, 4, or 5 in the provided data.

- **Group B (Junior):** Respondent 23 has 'Integration_of_Functions' = 4. The highest possible score is 5, but since 5 is not achieved by any respondent in this group, we consider the actual highest score, which is 4. Respondents with 'Need_for_Technical_Support' within 2 points of 4 (meaning 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, but since 6 is not possible, we consider up to 5) include respondent 23 with a score of 3, which meets the criteria.

- **Group C (Middle):** Respondents 53 and 70 have 'Integration_of_Functions' = 5, which is the highest possible score. For 'Need_for_Technical_Support' within 2 points of 5, we look for scores 3, 4, or 5. Respondents 53 and 70 both have a 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score of 1, which does not meet the criteria.

- **Group D (Intern):** Respondents 15, 29, 49, and 90 have 'Integration_of_Functions' scores ranging from 4 to 5. The highest score is 5. For 'Need_for_Technical_Support' within 2 points of 5, we look for scores 3, 4, or 5. Respondent 90 has a 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score of 2, which does not meet the criteria. Respondent 49 has a score of 4, which meets the criteria. Respondent 29 has a score of 1, which does not meet the criteria.

Based on the analysis, the respondents whose 'Need_for_Technical_Support' is within 2 points of the highest 'Integration_of_Functions' for their group are:

23, 49

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

Let's calculate the average 'Ease_of_Use' score for each group:

- Group A: (1 + 5) / 2 = 3
- Group B: (5 + 3) / 2 = 4
- Group C: (5 + 5 + 5 + 1 + 5) / 5 = 4.2
- Group D: (4) / 1 = 4

Now, let's identify the respondents whose 'Ease_of_Use' score exceeds the average for their group:

- Group A: None (since both scores are exactly at or below the average)
- Group B: ""44"" (score 5, which is higher than the average 4)
- Group C: ""54"", ""63"", ""33"", ""62"" (all have a score of 5, which is higher than the average 4.2)
- Group D: None (since there's only one respondent and their score equals the average)

Therefore, the respondents with an 'Ease_of_Use' score higher than the average for their group are:

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondents have a total positive usability score ('Ease_of_Use' + 'Integration_of_Functions') that is lower than the average for all respondents in a different group?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average total positive usability score for each group, and then identify which respondents have a score lower than the average of a different group.

1. **Calculate Total Positive Usability Score for Each Respondent:**
   - This score is the sum of 'Ease_of_Use' and 'Integration_of_Functions' for each respondent.

2. **Determine the Group of Each Respondent:**
   - Group is directly given in the 'Group' field of each respondent's answers.

3. **Calculate the Average Total Positive Usability Score for Each Group:**
   - Sum up the total positive usability scores of all respondents in a group and divide by the number of respondents in that group.

4. **Identify Respondents with a Score Lower Than the Average of a Different Group:**
   - Compare each respondent's score with the average scores of other groups.

Given data:

- Respondents and their scores:
  - 10 (D): Ease_of_Use = 4, Integration_of_Functions = 5, Total = 9
  - 52 (A): Ease_of_Use = 4, Integration_of_Functions = 4, Total = 8
  - 6 (A): Ease_of_Use = 4, Integration_of_Functions = 5, Total = 9
  - 76 (A): Ease_of_Use = 5, Integration_of_Functions = 4, Total = 9
  - 30 (D): Ease_of_Use = 5, Integration_of_Functions = 5, Total = 10
  - 82 (C): Ease_of_Use = 4, Integration_of_Functions = 4, Total = 8
  - 67 (A): Ease_of_Use = 5, Integration_of_Functions = 5, Total = 10
  - 20 (C): Ease_of_Use = 5, Integration_of_Functions = 4, Total = 9

- Groups and their average total positive usability scores:
  - Group A: (8 + 9 + 9 + 10) / 4 = 36 / 4 = 9
  - Group D: (9 + 10) / 2 = 19 / 2 = 9.5
  - Group C: (8 + 9) / 2 = 17 / 2 = 8.5

Now, comparing each respondent's score with the average of other groups:

- For Group A (Average = 9):
  - 52 (Score = 8) is lower than Group D's average (9.5).
  
- For Group D (Average = 9.5):
  - 10 (Score = 9) is lower than Group D's own average, but we are looking for averages of different groups. Since Group D's average is the highest, no respondent in Group D has a score lower than another group's average.
  
- For Group C (Average = 8.5):
  - Both respondents (82 and 20) have scores (8 and 9, respectively) that are higher or equal to the average of their own group, but we need to compare with other groups. 
  - 82 (Score = 8) is lower than both Group A's (9) and Group D's (9.5) averages.

Thus, the respondents who have a total positive usability score lower than the average for all respondents in a different group are:

52, 82

These respondents have scores lower than the average of at least one other group.",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents have a total positive usability score ('Ease_of_Use' + 'Integration_of_Functions') that is lower than the average for all respondents in a different group?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average total positive usability score for each group, and then identify respondents whose score is lower than the average of a different group.

1. **Calculate Total Positive Usability Score for Each Respondent:**
   - The total positive usability score is the sum of 'Ease_of_Use' and 'Integration_of_Functions'.

2. **Group Respondents by 'Group' and Calculate Average Total Positive Usability Score for Each Group:**
   - We will calculate the average score for each group (A, B, C, D) separately.

3. **Identify Respondents with a Score Lower Than the Average of a Different Group:**
   - For each respondent, compare their score with the average scores of the other groups (not their own).

Let's proceed with the calculations based on the provided data:

### Step 1: Calculate Total Positive Usability Score for Each Respondent

| Respondent | Ease_of_Use | Integration_of_Functions | Total Score |
|------------|-------------|--------------------------|-------------|
| 46         | 1           | 1                        | 2           |
| 9          | 1           | 1                        | 2           |
| 56         | 4           | 5                        | 9           |
| 71         | 5           | 4                        | 9           |
| 59         | 5           | 5                        | 10          |
| 74         | 5           | 5                        | 10          |
| 44         | 5           | 2                        | 7           |
| 33         | 5           | 5                        | 10          |
| 66         | 5           | 5                        | 10          |
| 50         | 5           | 5                        | 10          |
| 51         | 5           | 5                        | 10          |
| 79         | 5           | 5                        | 10          |

### Step 2: Group Respondents and Calculate Average Total Positive Usability Score

- **Group A:** 46 (2), 56 (9), 59 (10)
  - Average = (2 + 9 + 10) / 3 = 21 / 3 = 7
- **Group B:** 44 (7), 66 (10), 79 (10)
  - Average = (7 + 10 + 10) / 3 = 27 / 3 = 9
- **Group C:** 9 (2), 33 (10), 50 (10), 51 (10)
  - Average = (2 + 10 + 10 + 10) / 4 = 32 / 4 = 8
- **Group D:** 71 (9), 74 (10)
  - Average = (9 + 10) / 2 = 19 / 2 = 9.5

### Step 3: Identify Respondents with a Score Lower Than the Average of a Different Group

- **Respondent 46 (Group A, Score 2):** Lower than averages of Group B (9), Group C (8), and Group D (9.5).
- **Respondent 9 (Group C, Score 2):** Lower than averages of Group A (7), Group B (9), and Group D (9.5).
- **Respondent 44 (Group B, Score 7):** Lower than averages of Group C (8) and Group D (9.5).

Thus, the respondents who have a total positive usability score lower than the average for all respondents in a different group are **46, 9, 44**.

The final answer is: $\boxed{46, 9, 44}$",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents have a total positive usability score ('Ease_of_Use' + 'Integration_of_Functions') that is lower than the average for all respondents in a different group?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average total positive usability score for each group, and then identify which respondents have a score lower than the average of a different group.

1. **Calculate Total Positive Usability Score for Each Respondent:**
   - This score is the sum of 'Ease_of_Use' and 'Integration_of_Functions' for each respondent.

2. **Determine the Group of Each Respondent:**
   - Map each respondent to their respective group based on the 'Group' answer.

3. **Calculate the Average Total Positive Usability Score for Each Group:**
   - Sum the total positive usability scores of all respondents in a group and divide by the number of respondents in that group.

4. **Identify Respondents with a Score Lower Than the Average of a Different Group:**
   - Compare each respondent's score with the average scores of the other groups to find those that are lower.

Given the data:

- **Group A:** Respondents 72, 65
- **Group B:** Respondent 69
- **Group C:** Respondents 17, 39
- **Group D:** Respondents 71, 41, 25

**Calculating Total Positive Usability Scores:**

- Respondent 71 (D): 5 (Ease_of_Use) + 4 (Integration_of_Functions) = 9
- Respondent 41 (D): 5 + 5 = 10
- Respondent 17 (C): 5 + 5 = 10
- Respondent 72 (A): 5 + 5 = 10
- Respondent 69 (B): 5 + 5 = 10
- Respondent 39 (C): 1 + 5 = 6
- Respondent 65 (A): 5 + 2 = 7
- Respondent 25 (D): 3 + 3 = 6

**Calculating Average Scores for Each Group:**

- **Group A:** (10 + 7) / 2 = 17 / 2 = 8.5
- **Group B:** 10 / 1 = 10
- **Group C:** (10 + 6) / 2 = 16 / 2 = 8
- **Group D:** (9 + 10 + 6) / 3 = 25 / 3 ≈ 8.33

**Identifying Respondents with a Score Lower Than the Average of a Different Group:**

- Respondent 71 (D) with a score of 9 is lower than the average of Group B (10).
- Respondent 39 (C) with a score of 6 is lower than the averages of Group A (8.5), Group B (10), and Group D (8.33).
- Respondent 25 (D) with a score of 6 is lower than the averages of Group A (8.5), Group B (10), and Group C (8).
- Respondent 65 (A) with a score of 7 is lower than the average of Group B (10) but not lower than the averages of Group C (8) or Group D (8.33).

Therefore, the respondents that have a total positive usability score lower than the average for all respondents in a different group are **71, 39, 25, 65**.",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents whose 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' is within 2 point of the highest 'Integration_of_Functions' for their group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to find the highest 'Integration_of_Functions' score for each group, and then identify the respondents whose 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score is within 2 points of this highest score for their respective group.

1. **Find the highest 'Integration_of_Functions' score for each group:**

   - Group A: The respondents are ""42"" and ""6"". Their 'Integration_of_Functions' scores are ""5"" and ""5"", respectively. The highest score is ""5"".
   - Group B: The respondents are ""66"" and ""36"". Their 'Integration_of_Functions' scores are ""5"" and ""5"", respectively. The highest score is ""5"".
   - Group C: The respondents are ""9"", ""53"", and ""88"". Their 'Integration_of_Functions' scores are ""1"", ""5"", and ""4"", respectively. The highest score is ""5"".
   - Group D: The respondents are ""45"", ""15"", ""71"", and ""7"". Their 'Integration_of_Functions' scores are ""5"", ""5"", ""4"", and ""4"", respectively. The highest score is ""5"".

2. **Identify respondents whose 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' is within 2 points of the highest 'Integration_of_Functions' for their group:**

   - For Group A (highest 'Integration_of_Functions' = 5), we look for 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' scores between 3 and 7 (5 - 2 = 3, 5 + 2 = 7). The respondents are ""42"" with a score of ""3"" and ""6"" with a score of ""1"". Only ""42"" meets the criteria.
   - For Group B (highest 'Integration_of_Functions' = 5), we look for 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' scores between 3 and 7. The respondents are ""66"" with a score of ""2"" and ""36"" with a score of ""1"". Neither meets the criteria.
   - For Group C (highest 'Integration_of_Functions' = 5), we look for 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' scores between 3 and 7. The respondents are ""9"" with a score of ""4"", ""53"" with a score of ""1"", and ""88"" with a score of ""1"". Only ""9"" meets the criteria.
   - For Group D (highest 'Integration_of_Functions' = 5), we look for 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' scores between 3 and 7. The respondents are ""45"" with a score of ""1"", ""15"" with a score of ""2"", ""71"" with a score of ""1"", and ""7"" with a score of ""1"". None meet the criteria.

Therefore, the respondents whose 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' is within 2 points of the highest 'Integration_of_Functions' for their group are ""42"" and ""9"".",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents whose 'System_Complexity' is within 1 point of the highest 'Cumbersome_to_Use' for their group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to understand the 'questions' schema and the 'responses' data. The 'System_Complexity' and 'Cumbersome_to_Use' are both Likert scale questions ranging from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). The 'Group' is a multiple-choice question with options A (Senior), B (Junior), C (Middle), and D (Intern).

Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify the Highest 'Cumbersome_to_Use' Score for Each Group:**
   - For each group (A, B, C, D), find the maximum 'Cumbersome_to_Use' score.
   - Group A: Maximum 'Cumbersome_to_Use' is 5 (from respondent 35) and 1 (from respondents 89 and 11), so the highest is 5.
   - Group B: Maximum 'Cumbersome_to_Use' is 5 (from respondent 61) and 1 (from respondents 47, 32), so the highest is 5.
   - Group C: Maximum 'Cumbersome_to_Use' is 2 (from respondent 82) and 1 (from respondent 43), so the highest is 2.
   - Group D: Maximum 'Cumbersome_to_Use' is 4 (from respondent 64), so the highest is 4.

2. **Determine the Range for 'System_Complexity' for Each Group:**
   - For each group, the 'System_Complexity' should be within 1 point of the highest 'Cumbersome_to_Use' score.
   - Group A: Range is 4 to 6, but since 'System_Complexity' is on a 1-5 scale, the effective range is 4 to 5.
   - Group B: Range is 4 to 6, but since 'System_Complexity' is on a 1-5 scale, the effective range is 4 to 5.
   - Group C: Range is 1 to 3.
   - Group D: Range is 3 to 5.

3. **List Respondents Whose 'System_Complexity' Falls Within the Determined Range for Their Group:**
   - Group A: Respondent 35 has a 'System_Complexity' of 5, which falls within the range.
   - Group B: Respondents 61 has a 'System_Complexity' of 5, which falls within the range.
   - Group C: Respondents 82 has a 'System_Complexity' of 1, and respondent 43 has a 'System_Complexity' of 1, both of which fall within the range.
   - Group D: Respondent 64 has a 'System_Complexity' of 3, which falls within the range.

Based on the analysis, the respondents whose 'System_Complexity' is within 1 point of the highest 'Cumbersome_to_Use' for their group are:

35, 61, 82, 43, 64",False
