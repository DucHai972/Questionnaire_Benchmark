</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'Inconsistency' score is between 2 and 5.
</task>","To find all respondents whose 'Inconsistency' score is between 2 and 5, we need to examine the 'responses' section of the provided data and look for the 'Inconsistency' scores that fall within this range.

From the data provided:

- Respondent8 has an 'Inconsistency' score of ""1"".
- Respondent12 has an 'Inconsistency' score of ""2"".
- Respondent11 has an 'Inconsistency' score of ""1"".
- Respondent47 has an 'Inconsistency' score of ""1"".
- Respondent22 has an 'Inconsistency' score of ""5"".
- Respondent86 has an 'Inconsistency' score of ""3"".
- Respondent40 has an 'Inconsistency' score of ""1"".
- Respondent33 has an 'Inconsistency' score of ""1"".

The respondents with 'Inconsistency' scores between 2 and 5 are:
- Respondent12 (score of 2)
- Respondent86 (score of 3)
- Respondent22 (score of 5)

Therefore, the list of respondents whose 'Inconsistency' score is between 2 and 5 is: Respondent12, Respondent86, Respondent22.",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents from the 'Junior' group whose 'Confidence_in_Use' is exactly 4.
</task>","To answer this question, we need to analyze the 'responses' section and find the respondents who belong to the 'Junior' group and have a 'Confidence_in_Use' score of exactly 4.


From the 'questions' section, we know that the 'Group' field is a MCQ with options:
A. Senior
B. Junior
C. Middle
D. Intern

We are looking for respondents with 'Group' = 'B' (Junior) and 'Confidence_in_Use' = 4.


After analyzing the 'responses' section, we find that:


:Respondent81 has 'Group' = 'A' (Senior) and 'Confidence_in_Use' = 4, so it does not match.


There are no respondents with 'Group' = 'B' (Junior) and 'Confidence_in_Use' = 4.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

From the 'questions' section, we know that the 'Group' field is a MCQ with options:
A. Senior
B. Junior
C. Middle
D. Intern

We are looking for respondents with 'Group' = 'C' (since C corresponds to 'Middle') and 'System_Complexity' = 4.


After examining the 'responses' section, we find that:

    pred:System_Complexity ""1"" ;

The only respondent from the 'Middle' group has a 'System_Complexity' score of 1, not 4.


Therefore, the list of respondents from the 'Middle' group with 'System_Complexity' exactly 4 is empty.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'System_Complexity' score is between 1 and 4.
</task>","To find all respondents whose 'System_Complexity' score is between 1 and 4, we need to examine the 'responses' section of the provided data and look for individuals with 'System_Complexity' scores within this range.

From the data provided:

- Respondent60 has a 'System_Complexity' score of ""1"".
- Respondent79 has a 'System_Complexity' score of ""1"".
- Respondent48 has a 'System_Complexity' score of ""1"".
- Respondent18 has a 'System_Complexity' score of ""1"".
- Respondent35 has a 'System_Complexity' score of ""5"", which is outside the specified range.
- Respondent24 has a 'System_Complexity' score of ""5"", which is also outside the specified range.

Therefore, the respondents with 'System_Complexity' scores between 1 and 4 are:

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'System_Complexity' score is between 1 and 3.
</task>","To find all respondents whose 'System_Complexity' score is between 1 and 3, we need to examine each respondent's data in the 'responses' section and identify those with a 'System_Complexity' score of 1, 2, or 3.

From the provided data:

- Respondent87 has a 'System_Complexity' score of ""2"".
- Respondent6 has a 'System_Complexity' score of ""1"".
- Respondent67 has a 'System_Complexity' score of ""1"".
- Respondent16 has a 'System_Complexity' score of ""1"".
- Respondent66 has a 'System_Complexity' score of ""1"".
- Respondent26 has a 'System_Complexity' score of ""2"".
- Respondent51 has a 'System_Complexity' score of ""1"".
- Respondent45 has a 'System_Complexity' score of ""1"".
- Respondent68 has a 'System_Complexity' score of ""3"".
- Respondent38 has a 'System_Complexity' score of ""1"".
- Respondent75 has a 'System_Complexity' score of ""1"".
- Respondent19 has a 'System_Complexity' score of ""1"".

Therefore, the respondents whose 'System_Complexity' score is between 1 and 3 are: Respondent87, Respondent6, Respondent67, Respondent16, Respondent66, Respondent26, Respondent51, Respondent45, Respondent68, Respondent38, Respondent75, Respondent19.

The IDs of these respondents are: 87, 6, 67, 16, 66, 26, 51, 45, 68, 38, 75, 19.",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents from the 'Senior' group whose 'Ease_of_Use' is exactly 3.
</task>","To answer this question, we need to analyze the 'responses' section and find the respondents who belong to the 'Senior' group and have an 'Ease_of_Use' score of exactly 3.


From the 'questions' section, we know that the 'Group' field is a MCQ with options:
A. Senior
B. Junior
C. Middle
D. Intern


We need to find the respondents with 'Group' = ""A"" (which corresponds to 'Senior') and 'Ease_of_Use' = ""3"".


After analyzing the 'responses' section, we find that:


None of the respondents have 'Group' = ""A"" and 'Ease_of_Use' = ""3"".

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".

</output>

<task>
List all respondents whose 'System_Complexity' score is greater than their 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to compare the 'System_Complexity' score with the 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score for each respondent and list those where 'System_Complexity' is greater.

From the provided data:

- Respondent26: System_Complexity = 2, Need_for_Technical_Support = 2. Since 2 is not greater than 2, Respondent26 does not meet the criteria.
- Respondent85: System_Complexity = 1, Need_for_Technical_Support = 1. Since 1 is not greater than 1, Respondent85 does not meet the criteria.
- Respondent27: System_Complexity = 4, Need_for_Technical_Support = 4. Since 4 is not greater than 4, Respondent27 does not meet the criteria.
- Respondent56: System_Complexity = 2, Need_for_Technical_Support = 1. Since 2 is greater than 1, Respondent56 meets the criteria.
- Respondent77: System_Complexity = 1, Need_for_Technical_Support = 1. Since 1 is not greater than 1, Respondent77 does not meet the criteria.

Therefore, the respondents whose 'System_Complexity' score is greater than their 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score are:

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose total score for 'Confidence_in_Use' and 'Ease_of_Learning' is less than 4.
</task>","To find all respondents whose total score for 'Confidence_in_Use' and 'Ease_of_Learning' is less than 4, we need to examine each respondent's scores for these two questions and sum them up.

From the 'responses' section:

- Respondent84: Confidence_in_Use = 5, Ease_of_Learning = 2. Total = 7.
- Respondent62: Confidence_in_Use = 5, Ease_of_Learning = 1. Total = 6.
- Respondent90: Confidence_in_Use = 5, Ease_of_Learning = 5. Total = 10.
- Respondent36: Confidence_in_Use = 4, Ease_of_Learning = 5. Total = 9.
- Respondent37: Confidence_in_Use = 5, Ease_of_Learning = 5. Total = 10.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents from the 'Junior' group have a 'System_Complexity' of 4 or more and a 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' of less than 4?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to analyze the 'responses' section and filter the respondents based on the given conditions.


First, we need to identify the respondents from the 'Junior' group. According to the 'questions' schema, the 'Group' field is a MCQ with options ""A. Senior B. Junior C. Middle D. Intern"". So, we are looking for respondents with 'Group' equal to ""B"" (case-insensitive).


Next, we need to filter the respondents with 'System_Complexity' of 4 or more and 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' of less than 4.


After analyzing the 'responses' section, we can see that there are no respondents from the 'Junior' group that meet these conditions.


Therefore, the answer is: 

There are no respondents that match the given criteria.",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents from the 'Middle' group have a 'Cumbersome_to_Use' of 4 or more and a 'Ease_of_Use' of less than 3?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to analyze the 'responses' section and filter the respondents based on the given conditions.


After analyzing the data, we can see that there are no respondents from the 'Middle' group who have a 'Cumbersome_to_Use' of 4 or more and a 'Ease_of_Use' of less than 3.


However, we do see that Respondent37 and Respondent51 and Respondent54 are from the 'Middle' group (Group ""C""). But none of them meet the 'Cumbersome_to_Use' and 'Ease_of_Use' conditions.


Since there are no respondents that meet the conditions, the answer is:

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents whose 'System_Complexity' score is greater than their 'Ease_of_Use' score.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to compare the 'System_Complexity' score with the 'Ease_of_Use' score for each respondent and list those where 'System_Complexity' is greater.

From the provided data:

- Respondent2: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 4. System_Complexity is not greater.
- Respondent61: System_Complexity = 5, Ease_of_Use = 2. System_Complexity is greater.
- Respondent15: System_Complexity = 2, Ease_of_Use = 4. System_Complexity is not greater.
- Respondent51: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5. System_Complexity is not greater.
- Respondent19: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5. System_Complexity is not greater.
- Respondent88: System_Complexity = 2, Ease_of_Use = 5. System_Complexity is not greater.
- Respondent6: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 4. System_Complexity is not greater.
- Respondent18: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 4. System_Complexity is not greater.
- Respondent69: System_Complexity = 4, Ease_of_Use = 5. System_Complexity is not greater.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents from the 'Junior' group have a 'Inconsistency' of 4 or more and a 'Confidence_in_Use' of less than 3?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to analyze the 'responses' section of the data and filter the respondents based on the given conditions.


First, we need to identify the respondents from the 'Junior' group. According to the schema, the 'Group' field is a MCQ with options A. Senior, B. Junior, C. Middle, and D. Intern. We are looking for respondents with 'Group' equal to 'B' (Junior).


Next, we need to filter the respondents with 'Inconsistency' of 4 or more and 'Confidence_in_Use' of less than 3.


After analyzing the data, we can see that there are no respondents from the 'Junior' group who have an 'Inconsistency' of 4 or more and a 'Confidence_in_Use' of less than 3.


Therefore, the answer is: 

There are no respondents that match the given conditions.",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose total score for 'Inconsistency' and 'Confidence_in_Use' is less than 6.
</task>","To find all respondents whose total score for 'Inconsistency' and 'Confidence_in_Use' is less than 6, we need to examine each respondent's scores for these two questions and sum them up.

From the 'responses' section:

1. Respondent68: Inconsistency = 2, Confidence_in_Use = 4, Total = 6
2. Respondent46: Inconsistency = 2, Confidence_in_Use = 3, Total = 5
3. Respondent75: Inconsistency = 4, Confidence_in_Use = 4, Total = 8
4. Respondent4: Inconsistency = 1, Confidence_in_Use = 5, Total = 6
5. Respondent30: Inconsistency = 1, Confidence_in_Use = 5, Total = 6
6. Respondent50: Inconsistency = 2, Confidence_in_Use = 4, Total = 6
7. Respondent47: Inconsistency = 1, Confidence_in_Use = 5, Total = 6
8. Respondent9: Inconsistency = 5, Confidence_in_Use = 2, Total = 7
9. Respondent55: Inconsistency = 1, Confidence_in_Use = 2, Total = 3
10. Respondent40: Inconsistency = 1, Confidence_in_Use = 5, Total = 6
11. Respondent44: Inconsistency = 1, Confidence_in_Use = 1, Total = 2
12. Respondent13: Inconsistency = 1, Confidence_in_Use = 5, Total = 6

The respondents with a total score less than 6 for 'Inconsistency' and 'Confidence_in_Use' are:
Respondent46, Respondent55, Respondent44.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose total score for 'Need_for_Technical_Support' and 'Ease_of_Learning' is less than 4.
</task>","To find all respondents whose total score for 'Need_for_Technical_Support' and 'Ease_of_Learning' is less than 4, we need to examine each respondent's scores for these two questions and sum them up.

From the 'responses' section:

1. **Respondent88**: Need_for_Technical_Support = 2, Ease_of_Learning = 4. Total = 6.
2. **Respondent78**: Need_for_Technical_Support = 4, Ease_of_Learning = 3. Total = 7.
3. **Respondent12**: Need_for_Technical_Support = 2, Ease_of_Learning = 5. Total = 7.
4. **Respondent80**: Need_for_Technical_Support = 3, Ease_of_Learning = 5. Total = 8.
5. **Respondent86**: Need_for_Technical_Support = 5, Ease_of_Learning = 5. Total = 10.
6. **Respondent82**: Need_for_Technical_Support = 1, Ease_of_Learning = 5. Total = 6.
7. **Respondent66**: Need_for_Technical_Support = 1, Ease_of_Learning = 5. Total = 6.
8. **Respondent5**: Need_for_Technical_Support = 1, Ease_of_Learning = 5. Total = 6.
9. **Respondent81**: Need_for_Technical_Support = 2, Ease_of_Learning = 5. Total = 7.
10. **Respondent48**: Need_for_Technical_Support = 1, Ease_of_Learning = 5. Total = 6.

None of the respondents have a total score for 'Need_for_Technical_Support' and 'Ease_of_Learning' that is less than 4. 

Respondent78, Respondent12, Respondent80, Respondent86, and Respondent81 do not meet the criteria because their totals are 7 or higher. The rest have totals of 6, which is also not less than 4.

Therefore, the list of respondents whose total score for these questions is less than 4 is empty.",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents from the 'Senior' group have a 'Confidence_in_Use' of 3 or more and a 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' of less than 4?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to analyze the 'responses' section and filter the respondents based on the given conditions.


First, we need to identify the respondents from the 'Senior' group. According to the 'questions' schema, the 'Group' field is a MCQ with options ""A. Senior B. Junior C. Middle D. Intern"". So, we are looking for respondents with 'Group' equal to ""A"" (case-insensitive).


Next, we need to filter the respondents with 'Confidence_in_Use' of 3 or more and 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' of less than 4.


After analyzing the data, we found that:


- Respondent55 has 'Group' equal to ""A"" (Senior), 'Confidence_in_Use' equal to 2 (less than 3), and 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' equal to 4 (not less than 4). So, this respondent does not meet the conditions.


- Respondent6 has 'Group' equal to ""A"" (Senior), 'Confidence_in_Use' equal to 5 (3 or more), and 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' equal to 1 (less than 4). So, this respondent meets the conditions.


Therefore, the respondent from the 'Senior' group who has a 'Confidence_in_Use' of 3 or more and a 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' of less than 4 is:

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

</task>","To find all respondents whose total score for 'Cumbersome_to_Use' and 'Integration_of_Functions' is less than 6, we need to examine each respondent's scores for these two questions and sum them up.

From the 'responses' section:

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose total score for 'Integration_of_Functions' and 'Inconsistency' is less than 6.
</task>","To find all respondents whose total score for 'Integration_of_Functions' and 'Inconsistency' is less than 6, we need to examine each respondent's scores for these two questions and sum them up.

From the 'responses' section:

1. **Respondent59**: Integration_of_Functions = 5, Inconsistency = 1. Total = 6.
2. **Respondent75**: Integration_of_Functions = 2, Inconsistency = 4. Total = 6.
3. **Respondent68**: Integration_of_Functions = 5, Inconsistency = 2. Total = 7.
4. **Respondent5**: Integration_of_Functions = 5, Inconsistency = 1. Total = 6.
5. **Respondent32**: Integration_of_Functions = 5, Inconsistency = 1. Total = 6.
6. **Respondent37**: Integration_of_Functions = 5, Inconsistency = 1. Total = 6.
7. **Respondent86**: Integration_of_Functions = 5, Inconsistency = 3. Total = 8.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'Ease_of_Learning' is greater than the average 'Ease_of_Learning' for their group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Ease_of_Learning' for each group and then identify the respondents whose 'Ease_of_Learning' score exceeds this average for their respective groups.

### Step 1: Calculate Average 'Ease_of_Learning' for Each Group

We'll start by grouping the respondents by their 'Group' and calculating the average 'Ease_of_Learning' for each group.

- **Group A**: Respondent89 has an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 5. Since there's only one respondent in Group A, the average is 5.
- **Group B**: Respondent36 has an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 5. With only one respondent in Group B, the average is 5.
- **Group C**: 
  - Respondent43 has an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 3.
  - Respondent22 has an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 4.
  - Respondent50 has an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 4.
  - Respondent37 has an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 5.
  The sum of their scores is 3 + 4 + 4 + 5 = 16, and there are 4 respondents, so the average is 16 / 4 = 4.
- **Group D**: 
  - Respondent49 has an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 4.
  - Respondent30 has an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 5.
  - Respondent74 has an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 5.
  - Respondent71 has an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 5.
  The sum of their scores is 4 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 19, and there are 4 respondents, so the average is 19 / 4 = 4.75.

### Step 2: Identify Respondents with 'Ease_of_Learning' Greater Than the Group Average

Now, we compare each respondent's 'Ease_of_Learning' score to the average for their group.

- **Group A**: Since the average is 5, and Respondent89 has a score of 5, they do not exceed the average.
- **Group B**: The average is 5, and Respondent36 has a score of 5, so they do not exceed the average.
- **Group C**: The average is 4. Respondents with scores greater than 4 are:
  - Respondent37 with a score of 5.
- **Group D**: The average is 4.75. Respondents with scores greater than 4.75 are:
  - Respondent30 with a score of 5.
  - Respondent74 with a score of 5.
  - Respondent71 does not exceed the average since their score is 5, which is not greater than 4.75 when considering the actual calculation and comparison.

### Conclusion

The respondents whose 'Ease_of_Learning' is greater than the average for their group are:

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents have an 'Ease_of_Use' score that is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score for their group?
</task>","To determine which respondents have an 'Ease_of_Use' score higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score for their group, we first need to calculate the average 'Ease_of_Use' score for each group and then compare each respondent's score against this average.

Given the data, let's calculate the average 'Ease_of_Use' score for each group:

1. **Group A (Senior)**: There are no respondents in Group A, so we cannot calculate an average.
2. **Group B (Junior)**:
   - Respondent36: Ease_of_Use = 5
   - Respondent32: Ease_of_Use = 5
   - Respondent14: Ease_of_Use = 4
   - Respondent12: Ease_of_Use = 5
   - Average for Group B = (5 + 5 + 4 + 5) / 4 = 19 / 4 = 4.75
3. **Group C (Middle)**:
   - Respondent82: Ease_of_Use = 4
   - Respondent4: Ease_of_Use = 5
   - Respondent87: Ease_of_Use = 3
   - Respondent70: Ease_of_Use = 5
   - Average for Group C = (4 + 5 + 3 + 5) / 4 = 17 / 4 = 4.25
4. **Group D (Intern)**:
   - Respondent15: Ease_of_Use = 4
   - Respondent29: Ease_of_Use = 4
   - Respondent18: Ease_of_Use = 4
   - Respondent12: Ease_of_Use = 5 (Note: Respondent12 is actually in Group D, not B as previously considered. Correcting this.)
   - Average for Group D = (4 + 4 + 4 + 5) / 4 = 17 / 4 = 4.25

Now, let's identify respondents with an 'Ease_of_Use' score higher than their group's average:

- **Group B**: Average is 4.75. Respondents with scores higher than the average are none since all scores are either at or below the average when considering the correct grouping.
- **Group C**: Average is 4.25. Respondents with scores higher than the average are Respondent4 (Ease_of_Use = 5) and Respondent70 (Ease_of_Use = 5).
- **Group D**: Average is 4.25. The respondent with a score higher than the average is Respondent12 (Ease_of_Use = 5).

Therefore, the respondents with an 'Ease_of_Use' score higher than the average for their group are Respondent4, Respondent70, and Respondent12.",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents have a total positive usability score ('Ease_of_Use' + 'Integration_of_Functions') that is lower than the average for all respondents in a different group?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the total positive usability score for each respondent, which is the sum of 'Ease_of_Use' and 'Integration_of_Functions'. Then, we calculate the average of this score for each group. Finally, we compare each respondent's score with the average score of the other groups to find those who have a score lower than the average of a different group.

1. **Calculate Total Positive Usability Score for Each Respondent:**

| Respondent | Ease_of_Use | Integration_of_Functions | Total Score |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Respondent5 | 5 | 5 | 10 |
| Respondent37 | 5 | 5 | 10 |
| Respondent90 | 5 | 5 | 10 |
| Respondent19 | 5 | 3 | 8 |
| Respondent60 | 5 | 4 | 9 |
| Respondent48 | 5 | 5 | 10 |
| Respondent86 | 1 | 5 | 6 |
| Respondent13 | 5 | 5 | 10 |
| Respondent59 | 5 | 5 | 10 |
| Respondent77 | 5 | 4 | 9 |
| Respondent64 | 2 | 2 | 4 |
| Respondent78 | 3 | 4 | 7 |

2. **Determine Group for Each Respondent:**

| Respondent | Group |
| --- | --- |
| Respondent5 | C |
| Respondent37 | C |
| Respondent90 | D |
| Respondent19 | C |
| Respondent60 | D |
| Respondent48 | D |
| Respondent86 | A |
| Respondent13 | A |
| Respondent59 | A |
| Respondent77 | D |
| Respondent64 | D |
| Respondent78 | D |

3. **Calculate Average Total Positive Usability Score for Each Group:**

- **Group A:** (6 + 10 + 10) / 3 = 26 / 3 = 8.67
- **Group C:** (10 + 10 + 8) / 3 = 28 / 3 = 9.33
- **Group D:** (10 + 9 + 10 + 9 + 4 + 7) / 6 = 49 / 6 = 8.17

4. **Identify Respondents with a Score Lower than the Average of a Different Group:**

- Respondents in Group A (average = 8.67):
  - Respondent86 (score = 6) is lower than Group C's average (9.33) and Group D's average (8.17) is actually lower, so this doesn't apply directly for comparison to Group D, but Respondent86's score is lower than Group C's average.
- Respondents in Group C (average = 9.33):
  - None have a score lower than Group A's average (8.67) since the lowest in Group C is 8, which is still higher than 8.67 is not true, it's actually lower or close, but considering Group D's average (8.17), Respondent19 (score = 8) is actually higher than Group D's average, not lower.
- Respondents in Group D (average = 8.17):
  - Respondent64 (score = 4) and Respondent78 (score = 7) are lower than Group A's average (8.67) and Group C's average (9.33).
  - Respondent60 (score = 9) is higher than the average of Group A and Group D, so not applicable.
  - Respondent77 (score = 9) is also higher than Group A and Group D's averages, so not applicable.
  - Respondent90 (score = 10) and Respondent48 (score = 10) are higher than all group averages, so not applicable.

Given the calculations and comparisons, the respondents who have a total positive usability score lower than the average for all respondents in a different group are:

- Respondent86 (Group A, score = 6, lower than Group C's average)
- Respondent64 (Group D, score = 4, lower than Group A and Group C's averages)
- Respondent78 (Group D, score = 7, lower than Group A and Group C's averages)
- Respondent19 (Group C, score = 8, actually lower than Group A's average, not just Group D's as initially considered)

Therefore, the respondents who meet the criteria are Respondent86, Respondent64, Respondent78, and Respondent19.",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents whose 'Need_for_Technical_Support' is within 2 point of the highest 'Integration_of_Functions' for their group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to understand the 'questions' schema and the 'responses' data. The question asks for respondents whose 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score is within 2 points of the highest 'Integration_of_Functions' score for their respective group.

1. **Identify Groups and Their Highest 'Integration_of_Functions' Scores:**
   - Group A: Respondent67 has an 'Integration_of_Functions' score of 5.
   - Group B: Respondent23 has an 'Integration_of_Functions' score of 4.
   - Group C: Respondents53, 67, and 70 have 'Integration_of_Functions' scores of 5.
   - Group D: Respondents15, 29, 49, and 90 have 'Integration_of_Functions' scores, with the highest being 5 (Respondents15, 49, and 90).

2. **Determine the Threshold for 'Need_for_Technical_Support' for Each Group:**
   - For a score to be within 2 points of the highest 'Integration_of_Functions', we consider scores that are 2 points below or above the highest score.
   - Group A (Highest 'Integration_of_Functions' = 5): Threshold range = 3 to 7. Since 'Need_for_Technical_Support' is on a 1-5 scale, the effective range for Group A is 3 to 5.
   - Group B (Highest 'Integration_of_Functions' = 4): Threshold range = 2 to 6. The effective range for Group B is 2 to 5.
   - Group C (Highest 'Integration_of_Functions' = 5): Same as Group A, the effective range is 3 to 5.
   - Group D (Highest 'Integration_of_Functions' = 5): Same as Group A, the effective range is 3 to 5.

3. **Identify Respondents Whose 'Need_for_Technical_Support' Scores Fall Within These Ranges:**
   - Group A: Respondent67 has a 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score of 1, which does not fall within the range.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents have an 'Ease_of_Use' score that is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score for their group?
</task>","To determine which respondents have an 'Ease_of_Use' score higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score for their group, we first need to calculate the average 'Ease_of_Use' score for each group and then compare each respondent's score against this average.

### Step 1: Calculate Average 'Ease_of_Use' Score for Each Group

- **Group A**: Respondents 35 and 11 have scores of 1 and 5, respectively. Average = (1 + 5) / 2 = 3.
- **Group B**: Respondents 44 and 3 have scores of 5 and 3, respectively. Average = (5 + 3) / 2 = 4.
- **Group C**: Respondents 54, 63, 33, and 39, and 62 have scores of 5, 5, 5, 1, and 5, respectively. Average = (5 + 5 + 5 + 1 + 5) / 5 = 4.2.
- **Group D**: Respondent 10 has a score of 4. Since there's only one respondent in this group, the average is 4.

### Step 2: Identify Respondents with Higher 'Ease_of_Use' Score Than Their Group's Average

- **Group A**: Respondent 11 has a score of 5, which is higher than the group average of 3.
- **Group B**: Respondent 44 has a score of 5, which is higher than the group average of 4.
- **Group C**: Respondents 54, 63, 33, and 62 all have scores of 5, which is higher than the group average of 4.2.
- **Group D**: Since the average is 4 and Respondent 10 has a score of 4, they do not have a higher score than the average.

### Respondents with Higher 'Ease_of_Use' Score

Based on the calculations, the respondents with an 'Ease_of_Use' score higher than their group's average are:

Respondent 11, Respondent 44, Respondent 54, Respondent 63, Respondent 33, Respondent 62.

Therefore, the list of respondent IDs is: 11, 44, 54, 63, 33, 62.",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents have a total positive usability score ('Ease_of_Use' + 'Integration_of_Functions') that is lower than the average for all respondents in a different group?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the total positive usability score for each respondent, which is the sum of 'Ease_of_Use' and 'Integration_of_Functions'. Then, we need to calculate the average of this score for each group. Finally, we compare each respondent's score with the average score of the other groups to find those who have a score lower than the average of a different group.

### Step 1: Calculate Total Positive Usability Score for Each Respondent

- Respondent10: 4 (Ease_of_Use) + 5 (Integration_of_Functions) = 9
- Respondent52: 4 + 4 = 8
- Respondent6: 4 + 5 = 9
- Respondent76: 5 + 4 = 9
- Respondent30: 5 + 5 = 10
- Respondent82: 4 + 4 = 8
- Respondent67: 5 + 5 = 10
- Respondent20: 5 + 4 = 9

### Step 2: Determine the Group of Each Respondent

- Respondent10: D
- Respondent52: A
- Respondent6: A
- Respondent76: A
- Respondent30: D
- Respondent82: C
- Respondent67: A
- Respondent20: C

### Step 3: Calculate the Average Total Positive Usability Score for Each Group

#### Group A:
- Respondent52: 8
- Respondent6: 9
- Respondent76: 9
- Respondent67: 10
- Average = (8 + 9 + 9 + 10) / 4 = 36 / 4 = 9

#### Group D:
- Respondent10: 9
- Respondent30: 10
- Average = (9 + 10) / 2 = 19 / 2 = 9.5

#### Group C:
- Respondent82: 8
- Respondent20: 9
- Average = (8 + 9) / 2 = 17 / 2 = 8.5

### Step 4: Identify Respondents with a Score Lower than the Average of Another Group

- For Group A (Average = 9), compare with Group D's average (9.5) and Group C's average (8.5). Since Group A's average is higher than Group C's but lower than Group D's, we look for scores in Group A that are lower than 9.5 (Group D's average) and scores in Group C that are lower than 9 (Group A's average).
  - Respondent52 (Group A) has a score of 8, which is lower than Group D's average (9.5).
- For Group D (Average = 9.5), compare with Group A's average (9) and Group C's average (8.5). Since Group D's average is higher than both, we look for scores in Group D that are lower than 9 (Group A's average) or 8.5 (Group C's average), but since both averages are lower than Group D's, we actually compare Group D's scores to see if any are lower than the other groups' averages, which isn't applicable directly as Group D has the highest average.
  - No respondents in Group D have scores lower than the averages of other groups since their average is the highest.
- For Group C (Average = 8.5), compare with Group A's average (9) and Group D's average (9.5). Group C's average is the lowest, so we look for scores in Group C that are lower than Group A's average (9) or Group D's average (9.5).
  - Respondent82 (Group C) has a score of 8, which is lower than both Group A's (9) and Group D's (9.5) averages.

### Conclusion

Respondents with a total positive usability score lower than the average for all respondents in a different group are:

- Respondent52 (Group A) with a score of 8, which is lower than Group D's average.
- Respondent82 (Group C) with a score of 8, which is lower than both Group A's and Group D's averages.

Therefore, the respondents that meet the criteria are Respondent52, Respondent82.",False

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondents have a total positive usability score ('Ease_of_Use' + 'Integration_of_Functions') that is lower than the average for all respondents in a different group?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the total positive usability score for each respondent, which is the sum of 'Ease_of_Use' and 'Integration_of_Functions'. Then, we need to calculate the average of this score for each group. Finally, we compare each respondent's score with the average score of the other groups to find those who have a lower score.

1. **Calculate Total Positive Usability Score for Each Respondent:**

| Respondent | Ease_of_Use | Integration_of_Functions | Total Score |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Respondent46 | 1 | 1 | 2 |
| Respondent9 | 1 | 1 | 2 |
| Respondent56 | 4 | 5 | 9 |
| Respondent71 | 5 | 4 | 9 |
| Respondent59 | 5 | 5 | 10 |
| Respondent74 | 5 | 5 | 10 |
| Respondent44 | 5 | 2 | 7 |
| Respondent33 | 5 | 5 | 10 |
| Respondent66 | 5 | 5 | 10 |
| Respondent50 | 5 | 5 | 10 |
| Respondent51 | 5 | 5 | 10 |
| Respondent79 | 5 | 5 | 10 |

2. **Calculate Average Total Positive Usability Score for Each Group:**

- **Group A:** (2 + 9 + 10 + 10) / 4 = 31 / 4 = 7.75
- **Group B:** (7 + 10 + 10) / 3 = 27 / 3 = 9
- **Group C:** (2 + 10 + 10 + 10) / 4 = 32 / 4 = 8
- **Group D:** (9 + 10) / 2 = 19 / 2 = 9.5

3. **Identify Respondents with a Score Lower than the Average of Another Group:**

- Respondent46 (Group A, Score 2) is lower than the average of Group B, C, and D.
- Respondent9 (Group C, Score 2) is lower than the average of Group B, C, and D.
- Respondent44 (Group B, Score 7) is lower than the average of Group D.

Thus, the respondents who have a total positive usability score lower than the average for all respondents in a different group are Respondent46, Respondent9, and Respondent44. 

The final answer is: $\boxed{46, 9, 44}$",False

<task>
Which respondents have a total positive usability score ('Ease_of_Use' + 'Integration_of_Functions') that is lower than the average for all respondents in a different group?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the total positive usability score for each respondent, which is the sum of 'Ease_of_Use' and 'Integration_of_Functions'. Then, we need to calculate the average of this score for each group. Finally, we compare each respondent's score with the average score of the other groups to find those who have a lower score.

1. **Calculate Total Positive Usability Score for Each Respondent:**

- Respondent71: 5 (Ease_of_Use) + 4 (Integration_of_Functions) = 9
- Respondent41: 5 + 5 = 10
- Respondent17: 5 + 5 = 10
- Respondent72: 5 + 5 = 10
- Respondent69: 5 + 5 = 10
- Respondent39: 1 + 5 = 6
- Respondent65: 5 + 2 = 7
- Respondent25: 3 + 3 = 6

2. **Determine Group for Each Respondent:**

- Respondent71: D
- Respondent41: D
- Respondent17: C
- Respondent72: A
- Respondent69: B
- Respondent39: C
- Respondent65: A
- Respondent25: D

3. **Calculate Average Total Positive Usability Score for Each Group:**

- Group A: (10 + 7) / 2 = 8.5
- Group B: 10 / 1 = 10
- Group C: (10 + 6) / 2 = 8
- Group D: (9 + 10 + 6) / 3 = 8.33

4. **Compare Each Respondent's Score with the Average of Other Groups:**

- Respondent71 (D, score = 9): Compare with A (8.5), B (10), C (8). Lower than B.

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
List all respondents whose 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' is within 2 point of the highest 'Integration_of_Functions' for their group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to understand the 'questions' schema and the 'responses' data. The question asks for respondents whose 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score is within 2 points of the highest 'Integration_of_Functions' score for their respective group.

1. **Identify Groups and Their Highest 'Integration_of_Functions' Scores:**
   - Group A: Highest 'Integration_of_Functions' score is 5 (from Respondent42 and Respondent6).
   - Group B: Highest 'Integration_of_Functions' score is 5 (from Respondent66 and Respondent36).
   - Group C: Highest 'Integration_of_Functions' score is 5 (from Respondent53), but since Respondent53 is not in the provided responses for calculation, we consider Respondent88 with a score of 4 as the highest within the group for this specific task context.
   - Group D: Highest 'Integration_of_Functions' score is 5 (from Respondent45, Respondent15, and Respondent71).

2. **Determine the Threshold for 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use':**
   - For Group A, the threshold is 5 - 2 = 3 to 5 + 2 = 7, but since scores can only be 1-5, the effective range is 3 to 5.
   - For Group B, the threshold is the same as Group A, 3 to 5.
   - For Group C, considering the highest score available for this task is 4, the threshold is 4 - 2 = 2 to 4 + 2 = 6, but effectively 2 to 5.
   - For Group D, the threshold is the same as Group A and B, 3 to 5.

3. **List Respondents Within the Threshold:**
   - Group A: Respondent42 (Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = 3) and Respondent6 (Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = 1) are considered. Only Respondent42 fits within the 3 to 5 range.
   - Group B: Respondent66 (Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = 2) and Respondent36 (Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = 1) are considered. Neither fits within the 3 to 5 range.
   - Group C: Respondent88 (Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = 1) and Respondent53 (if considered, Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = 1) are considered. Neither fits within the 2 to 5 range based on the adjusted threshold for this group.
   - Group D: Respondent45 (Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = 1), Respondent15 (Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = 2), Respondent71 (Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = 1), and Respondent7 (Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = 1) are considered. None fit within the 3 to 5 range.

Given the analysis, the respondents whose 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' is within 2 points of the highest 'Integration_of_Functions' for their group are:

Respondent42 

Note: The initial interpretation aimed to strictly follow the provided format and question context. However, upon reevaluation for accuracy and adherence to the specified output format, the focus is on directly answering the question as per the instructions without additional elaboration beyond the required response format.",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
List all respondents whose 'System_Complexity' is within 1 point of the highest 'Cumbersome_to_Use' for their group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to identify the highest 'Cumbersome_to_Use' score for each group and then find the respondents whose 'System_Complexity' score is within 1 point of that highest score.

From the 'questions' section, we understand the schema, but we don't need to map any MCQ fields for this task since 'System_Complexity' and 'Cumbersome_to_Use' are Likert scale questions.

Let's analyze the 'responses' section:

1. **Group A**:
   - Respondent35: Cumbersome_to_Use = 5 (highest in Group A)
   - Respondent89: Cumbersome_to_Use = 1
   - Respondent11: Cumbersome_to_Use = 1
   - The highest 'Cumbersome_to_Use' in Group A is 5. Respondents with 'System_Complexity' within 1 point of 5 are those with scores 4 or 5.
     - Respondent35: System_Complexity = 5 (matches)
     - Respondent89: System_Complexity = 2 (does not match)
     - Respondent11: System_Complexity = 1 (does not match)

2. **Group B**:
   - Respondent47: Cumbersome_to_Use = 1
   - Respondent32: Cumbersome_to_Use = 1
   - Respondent61: Cumbersome_to_Use = 5 (highest in Group B)
   - The highest 'Cumbersome_to_Use' in Group B is 5. Respondents with 'System_Complexity' within 1 point of 5 are those with scores 4 or 5.
     - Respondent47: System_Complexity = 1 (does not match)
     - Respondent32: System_Complexity = 1 (does not match)
     - Respondent61: System_Complexity = 5 (matches)

3. **Group C**:
   - Respondent82: Cumbersome_to_Use = 2
   - Respondent43: Cumbersome_to_Use = 1
   - The highest 'Cumbersome_to_Use' in Group C is 2. Respondents with 'System_Complexity' within 1 point of 2 are those with scores 1, 2, or 3.
     - Respondent82: System_Complexity = 1 (matches)
     - Respondent43: System_Complexity = 1 (matches)

4. **Group D**:
   - Respondent64: Cumbersome_to_Use = 4 (highest in Group D)
   - The highest 'Cumbersome_to_Use' in Group D is 4. Respondents with 'System_Complexity' within 1 point of 4 are those with scores 3, 4, or 5.
     - Respondent64: System_Complexity = 3 (matches)

So, the respondents whose 'System_Complexity' is within 1 point of the highest 'Cumbersome_to_Use' for their group are:
- Respondent35
- Respondent61
- Respondent82
- Respondent43
- Respondent64

Therefore, the list of respondents is: Respondent35, Respondent61, Respondent82, Respondent43, Respondent64.",False
