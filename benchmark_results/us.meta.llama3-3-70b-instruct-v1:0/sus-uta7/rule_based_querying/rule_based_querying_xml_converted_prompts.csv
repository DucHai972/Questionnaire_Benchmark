</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

List all respondents from the 'Junior' group whose 'Confidence_in_Use' is exactly 4.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the respondents who belong to the 'Junior' group.
2. Among those, find the ones whose 'Confidence_in_Use' score is exactly 4.

From the provided data, we can see that the 'Group' question has the following options: 
- A. Senior
- B. Junior
- C. Middle
- D. Intern

We are looking for respondents with 'B' as their answer to the 'Group' question, which corresponds to 'Junior'.

Now, let's examine each respondent's data:

- Respondent 31: Group = D (Intern), Confidence_in_Use = 1
- Respondent 76: Group = A (Senior), Confidence_in_Use = 5
- Respondent 70: Group = C (Middle), Confidence_in_Use = 5
- Respondent 17: Group = C (Middle), Confidence_in_Use = 5
- Respondent 48: Group = D (Intern), Confidence_in_Use = 5
- Respondent 78: Group = D (Intern), Confidence_in_Use = 2
- Respondent 61: Group = B (Junior), Confidence_in_Use = 1
- Respondent 81: Group = A (Senior), Confidence_in_Use = 4

From the data, we can see that only one respondent (81) has a 'Confidence_in_Use' score of 4, but this respondent is from the 'Senior' group, not the 'Junior' group. The only respondent from the 'Junior' group is respondent 61, but their 'Confidence_in_Use' score is 1, not 4.

Therefore, there are no respondents from the 'Junior' group whose 'Confidence_in_Use' is exactly 4. 

The final answer is: $\boxed{81}$",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents from the 'Intern' group whose 'Need_for_Technical_Support' is exactly 1.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to follow the instructions provided and analyze the given data.

First, we look at the 'questions' section to understand the schema. The question about the group of the respondent is defined as ""[MCQ: A. Senior B. Junior C. Middle D. Intern]"". This means that the letter ""D"" corresponds to the ""Intern"" group.

Next, we examine the 'responses' section to find respondents who belong to the ""Intern"" group and have a 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score of exactly 1.

From the provided data, we find one respondent who matches this criterion:

- Respondent id=""31"" is in the ""Intern"" group (since their answer to the ""Group"" question is ""D"") and has a 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score of 2, which does not match our criterion.
- There are no other respondents in the ""Intern"" group with a 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score of exactly 1 in the provided data.

However, upon re-examining the data, it appears there might have been an oversight in the initial analysis regarding the specific request for respondents with 'Need_for_Technical_Support' as exactly 1 from the 'Intern' group. Given the data provided:

- Respondent id=""31"" belongs to the ""Intern"" group but has a 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score of 2, not 1.

Actually, there is one respondent who fits the description of being in the 'Intern' group and having a 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score of 1 is not found directly in the initial description. However, upon a detailed review, it's clear the task requires identifying such respondents based on the 'Intern' group and the specific score for 'Need_for_Technical_Support'. 

Given the provided data and the specific criteria, the correct answer based on the detailed analysis should reflect the respondent IDs that match both conditions accurately. Since the initial analysis might have led to confusion by not directly identifying such a respondent, the correct approach is to carefully list all respondents who are interns and have the specified need for technical support score.

Given this, the correct list of respondents who are interns and have a 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score of exactly 1, based on the data provided, is actually not directly identified in the initial analysis. The correct identification should be:

None of the provided respondents directly match the criteria of being an 'Intern' and having a 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score of exactly 1, as per the detailed data analysis.

The final answer is: $\boxed{31}$",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents from the 'Middle' group whose 'System_Complexity' is exactly 4.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to follow the instructions and analyze the provided data.


First, we look at the 'questions' section to understand the context and meaning of the data points. The 'Group' question is a multiple-choice question with options A. Senior, B. Junior, C. Middle, and D. Intern. The 'System_Complexity' question is a Likert scale question with scores ranging from 1 to 5.


Next, we examine the 'responses' section to find respondents from the 'Middle' group whose 'System_Complexity' score is exactly 4. We look for respondents with 'Group' answer 'C' (which corresponds to 'Middle') and 'System_Complexity' answer '4'.


After analyzing the data, we find that there is no respondent who meets the specified criteria. However, since the task requires us to list all respondents from the 'Middle' group whose 'System_Complexity' is exactly 4, and there is one respondent with 'Group' answer 'C' but their 'System_Complexity' score is 1, not 4, the list of respondents that meet the criteria is empty.


The final answer is: $\boxed{33}$",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents from the 'Senior' group whose 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' is exactly 1.
</task>","To answer this question, we need to analyze the 'responses' section of the given dataset and identify the respondents who belong to the 'Senior' group and have a 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score of exactly 1.

From the 'questions' section, we understand that the 'Group' question is a multiple-choice question with options A. Senior, B. Junior, C. Middle, and D. Intern. We are interested in respondents who selected option A, which corresponds to the 'Senior' group.

We also need to examine the 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' question, which is a Likert scale question with scores ranging from 1 to 5. We are looking for respondents with a score of exactly 1 on this question.

Now, let's analyze the 'responses' section:

- Respondent 42: Group = A (Senior), Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = 3 (does not match)
- Respondent 20: Group = C (Middle), Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = 4 (does not match)
- Respondent 51: Group = C (Middle), Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = 1 (does not match because not Senior)
- Respondent 84: Group = D (Intern), Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = 1 (does not match because not Senior)
- Respondent 7: Group = D (Intern), Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = 1 (does not match because not Senior)

However, upon re-examining the provided data, it appears there might be an oversight in the initial analysis regarding the direct match for the 'Senior' group with 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' as 1. Given the data provided:

- Only Respondent 42 is from the 'Senior' group, but their 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score is 3, not 1.

Thus, based on the given data, there are no respondents from the 'Senior' group whose 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' is exactly 1. 

The final answer is: $\boxed{42}$",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'Inconsistency' score is between 1 and 3.
</task>","To find all respondents whose 'Inconsistency' score is between 1 and 3, we need to examine the 'responses' section of the provided XML data and look for the 'Inconsistency' scores that fall within this range.

From the data provided:

- Respondent 30 has an 'Inconsistency' score of 1.
- Respondent 48 has an 'Inconsistency' score of 1.
- Respondent 17 has an 'Inconsistency' score of 1.
- Respondent 6 has an 'Inconsistency' score of 1.
- Respondent 49 has an 'Inconsistency' score of 4, which is outside the specified range.
- Respondent 25 has an 'Inconsistency' score of 4, which is also outside the specified range.

Therefore, the respondents whose 'Inconsistency' score is between 1 and 3 (inclusive) are:

30, 48, 17, 6

These respondents have scores of 1, which falls within the specified range. Since there are no scores of 2 or 3 in the provided data, the list only includes those with a score of 1.",False

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'System_Complexity' score is between 1 and 4.
</task>","To find all respondents whose 'System_Complexity' score is between 1 and 4, we need to examine each respondent's answer to the 'System_Complexity' question and identify those with scores within this range.

From the provided data:

- Respondent 60 has a 'System_Complexity' score of 1.
- Respondent 79 has a 'System_Complexity' score of 1.
- Respondent 48 has a 'System_Complexity' score of 1.
- Respondent 18 has a 'System_Complexity' score of 1.
- Respondent 35 has a 'System_Complexity' score of 5.
- Respondent 24 has a 'System_Complexity' score of 5.

Since we are looking for scores between 1 and 4 (inclusive), respondents 60, 79, 48, and 18 qualify because their scores are 1, which falls within the specified range. There are no respondents with scores of 2, 3, or 4 in the provided data.

Therefore, the respondents whose 'System_Complexity' score is between 1 and 4 are: 60, 79, 48, 18.",False

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".

After examining the data, we find that the respondents with id ""5"", ""2"", and ""62"" are from the 'Middle' group (since their answer to the ""Group"" question is ""C"", which corresponds to ""Middle"" according to the schema). However, none of them have a 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score of exactly 4. 

Respondent ""5"" has a score of 1, respondent ""2"" has a score of 1, and respondent ""62"" also has a score of 1.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score is between 1 and 2.
</task>","To find all respondents whose 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score is between 1 and 2, we need to look at the 'responses' section of the data and identify the respondents with scores of 1 or 2 for the 'Need_for_Technical_Support' question.

From the data provided:

- Respondent 47 has a score of 1.
- Respondent 62 has a score of 1.
- Respondent 30 has a score of 1.
- Respondent 58 has a score of 1.
- Respondent 37 has a score of 2.

Therefore, the respondents whose 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score is between 1 and 2 are 47, 62, 30, 58, and 37.

The final answer is: 47, 62, 30, 58, 37",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'Cumbersome_to_Use' score is between 1 and 3.
</task>","To find all respondents whose 'Cumbersome_to_Use' score is between 1 and 3, we need to examine each respondent's answer to the 'Cumbersome_to_Use' question. According to the schema, 'Cumbersome_to_Use' is a Likert scale question with scores ranging from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree), where the respondent is expressing their level of agreement with the statement ""I found the system very awkward to use."" A score between 1 and 3 would indicate that the respondent somewhat disagrees or is neutral about the system being cumbersome to use.

Let's analyze the 'Cumbersome_to_Use' scores for each respondent:

- Respondent 67: Score = 1
- Respondent 54: Score = 1
- Respondent 39: Score = 4
- Respondent 47: Score = 1
- Respondent 38: Score = 1

Based on the given scores, the respondents with a 'Cumbersome_to_Use' score between 1 and 3 are:

67, 54, 47, 38

These respondents have scores that fall within the specified range, indicating they found the system not very cumbersome to use, according to their level of agreement with the statement.",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'System_Complexity' score is between 1 and 3.
</task>","To find all respondents whose 'System_Complexity' score is between 1 and 3, we need to examine each respondent's answer to the 'System_Complexity' question and identify those with scores of 1, 2, or 3.

From the provided data:

- Respondent 87 has a 'System_Complexity' score of 2.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents from the 'Senior' group whose 'Need_for_Technical_Support' is exactly 1.
</task>","To solve this task, I will follow the provided format and analyze the given data.

First, I will refer to the 'questions' section to understand the context and meaning of the data points. The 'Group' question has the following schema: ""[MCQ: A. Senior B. Junior C. Middle D. Intern]"". This means that 'A' corresponds to 'Senior', 'B' corresponds to 'Junior', and so on.

The 'Need_for_Technical_Support' question has a Likert scale of 1-5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" and 5 means ""Strongly Agree"". Since we are looking for respondents with a 'Need_for_Technical_Support' of exactly 1, this means they ""Strongly Disagree"" with needing technical support.

Now, I will analyze the 'responses' section to find the respondents that match the given criteria. I will look for respondents with 'Group' = 'A' (Senior) and 'Need_for_Technical_Support' = 1.

The matching respondents are:
- Respondent 38: 'Group' = 'A' (Senior), 'Need_for_Technical_Support' = 3 (does not match)
- Respondent 11: 'Group' = 'A' (Senior), 'Need_for_Technical_Support' = 5 (does not match)
- Respondent 76: 'Group' = 'A' (Senior), 'Need_for_Technical_Support' = 1 (matches)
- Respondent 46: 'Group' = 'A' (Senior), 'Need_for_Technical_Support' = 2 (does not match)
- Respondent 55: 'Group' = 'A' (Senior), 'Need_for_Technical_Support' = 1 (matches)

The respondents from the 'Senior' group with 'Need_for_Technical_Support' exactly 1 are: 76, 55, 3 does not belong to the senior group, and 40 does not belong to the senior group but 38 and 11 also do not have a Need_for_Technical_Support of 1, however 40 and 3 do have a Need_for_Technical_Support of 1 but do not belong to the senior group.

The final answer is: 76, 55",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents from the 'Middle' group whose 'Frequent_Usage' is exactly 3.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the 'Middle' group respondents.
2. Filter those respondents whose 'Frequent_Usage' score is exactly 3.

From the provided data, the 'Group' question has the following schema: ""[MCQ: A. Senior B. Junior C. Middle D. Intern]"". This means 'Middle' corresponds to option 'C'.

Now, let's examine the responses:

- Respondent 50: Group = C (Middle), Frequent_Usage = 1
- Respondent 75: Group = A (Senior), Frequent_Usage = 1
- Respondent 24: Group = C (Middle), Frequent_Usage = 2
- Respondent 28: Group = A (Senior), Frequent_Usage = 5
- Respondent 22: Group = C (Middle), Frequent_Usage = 1
- Respondent 25: Group = D (Intern), Frequent_Usage = 3
- Respondent 86: Group = A (Senior), Frequent_Usage = 4

None of the respondents from the 'Middle' group have a 'Frequent_Usage' score of exactly 3. 

The final answer is: $\boxed{25}$",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents from the 'Senior' group whose 'Ease_of_Use' is exactly 3.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the 'Senior' group respondents.
2. Filter those respondents whose 'Ease_of_Use' score is exactly 3.

From the provided data, we can see that the 'Group' question has the following options: 
""[MCQ: A. Senior B. Junior C. Middle D. Intern]"".

So, the 'Senior' group corresponds to option ""A"".

Now, let's examine each respondent's data:

- Respondent 49: Group = ""D"" (Intern), Ease_of_Use = 5
- Respondent 2: Group = ""C"" (Middle), Ease_of_Use = 4
- Respondent 28: Group = ""A"" (Senior), Ease_of_Use = 5
- Respondent 40: Group = ""C"" (Middle), Ease_of_Use = 5
- Respondent 82: Group = ""C"" (Middle), Ease_of_Use = 4
- Respondent 61: Group = ""B"" (Junior), Ease_of_Use = 2

None of the respondents from the 'Senior' group have an 'Ease_of_Use' score of exactly 3. 

The final answer is: $\boxed{None}$",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Find all respondents whose total score for 'Confidence_in_Use' and 'Ease_of_Learning' is less than 4.
</task>","To find the respondents whose total score for 'Confidence_in_Use' and 'Ease_of_Learning' is less than 4, we need to examine each respondent's answers for these two questions and sum them up.

1. Respondent 84: 
   - 'Confidence_in_Use' = 5
   - 'Ease_of_Learning' = 2
   Total = 7 (which is greater than 4)

2. Respondent 62: 
   - 'Confidence_in_Use' = 5
   - 'Ease_of_Learning' = 1
   Total = 6 (which is greater than 4)

3. Respondent 90: 
   - 'Confidence_in_Use' = 5
   - 'Ease_of_Learning' = 5
   Total = 10 (which is greater than 4)

4. Respondent 36: 
   - 'Confidence_in_Use' = 4
   - 'Ease_of_Learning' = 5
   Total = 9 (which is greater than 4)

5. Respondent 37: 
   - 'Confidence_in_Use' = 5
   - 'Ease_of_Learning' = 5
   Total = 10 (which is greater than 4)

None of the respondents have a total score for 'Confidence_in_Use' and 'Ease_of_Learning' that is less than 4.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents from the 'Junior' group have a 'System_Complexity' of 4 or more and a 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' of less than 4?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to analyze the 'responses' section of the provided data and filter the respondents based on the given conditions.


First, we identify the respondents from the 'Junior' group. According to the schema, the 'Group' question is a MCQ with options A. Senior, B. Junior, C. Middle, D. Intern. We look for respondents with answer 'B' (case-insensitive) for the 'Group' question.


Next, we filter these 'Junior' respondents to only include those with a 'System_Complexity' score of 4 or more and a 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score of less than 4.


After analyzing the data, we find that:


- Respondent '23' is from the 'Junior' group (answer 'B' for 'Group'), has a 'System_Complexity' score of 1 (which is less than 4), and a 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score of 3 (which is less than 4). However, the 'System_Complexity' score does not meet the condition of being 4 or more.


Since there are no respondents from the 'Junior' group that meet both conditions ('System_Complexity' of 4 or more and 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' of less than 4), the list of respondents that satisfy the given conditions is empty.


The final answer is: $\boxed{23}$",False

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondents from the 'Middle' group have a 'Cumbersome_to_Use' of 4 or more and a 'Ease_of_Use' of less than 3?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to analyze the 'responses' section of the provided data and filter the respondents based on the given conditions.


## Step 1: Identify the relevant questions and their IDs
The questions of interest are 'Group', 'Cumbersome_to_Use', and 'Ease_of_Use' with IDs 'Group', 'Cumbersome_to_Use', and 'Ease_of_Use' respectively.


## Step 2: Determine the condition for 'Group'
We are looking for respondents from the 'Middle' group. According to the schema, 'Group' is a MCQ with option C corresponding to 'Middle'.


## Step 3: Determine the condition for 'Cumbersome_to_Use'
We need respondents with a 'Cumbersome_to_Use' score of 4 or more.


## Step 4: Determine the condition for 'Ease_of_Use'
We need respondents with an 'Ease_of_Use' score of less than 3.


## Step 5: Filter the respondents based on the conditions
We will iterate through each respondent in the 'responses' section and check if they meet all the conditions.


## Step 6: Check each respondent
Respondent 71: Group = D, Cumbersome_to_Use = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5. Does not meet the conditions.
Respondent 10: Group = D, Cumbersome_to_Use = 1, Ease_of_Use = 4. Does not meet the conditions.
Respondent 45: Group = D, Cumbersome_to_Use = 1, Ease_of_Use = 4. Does not meet the conditions.
Respondent 77: Group = D, Cumbersome_to_Use = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5. Does not meet the conditions.
Respondent 78: Group = D, Cumbersome_to_Use = 2, Ease_of_Use = 3. Does not meet the conditions.
Respondent 37: Group = C, Cumbersome_to_Use = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5. Meets the group condition but not the other conditions.
Respondent 12: Group = D, Cumbersome_to_Use = 2, Ease_of_Use = 5. Does not meet the conditions.
Respondent 66: Group = B, Cumbersome_to_Use = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5. Does not meet the conditions.
Respondent 51: Group = C, Cumbersome_to_Use = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5. Meets the group condition but not the other conditions.
Respondent 54: Group = C, Cumbersome_to_Use = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5. Meets the group condition but not the other conditions.
Respondent 3: Group = B, Cumbersome_to_Use = 5, Ease_of_Use = 3. Does not meet the conditions.


## Step 7: Identify the respondents that meet the conditions
None of the respondents meet all the conditions.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
List all respondents whose 'System_Complexity' score is greater than their 'Ease_of_Use' score.
</task>","To solve this task, I will iterate through each respondent's answers and compare their 'System_Complexity' score with their 'Ease_of_Use' score.


Respondent 2: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 4. System_Complexity is not greater than Ease_of_Use.

Respondent 61: System_Complexity = 5, Ease_of_Use = 2. System_Complexity is greater than Ease_of_Use.

Respondent 15: System_Complexity = 2, Ease_of_Use = 4. System_Complexity is not greater than Ease_of_Use.

Respondent 51: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5. System_Complexity is not greater than Ease_of_Use.

Respondent 19: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5. System_Complexity is not greater than Ease_of_Use.

Respondent 88: System_Complexity = 2, Ease_of_Use = 5. System_Complexity is not greater than Ease_of_Use.

Respondent 6: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 4. System_Complexity is not greater than Ease_of_Use.

Respondent 18: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 4. System_Complexity is not greater than Ease_of_Use.

Respondent 69: System_Complexity = 4, Ease_of_Use = 5. System_Complexity is not greater than Ease_of_Use.


The only respondent whose 'System_Complexity' score is greater than their 'Ease_of_Use' score is respondent 61.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
List all respondents whose 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score is greater than their 'Ease_of_Learning' score.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to compare the scores of 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' and 'Ease_of_Learning' for each respondent and list those where 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' is greater.

From the provided data:

1. Respondent 10: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 2, 'Ease_of_Learning' = 5. Since 2 is not greater than 5, this respondent does not meet the criteria.
2. Respondent 28: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 4, 'Ease_of_Learning' = 5. Since 4 is not greater than 5, this respondent does not meet the criteria.
3. Respondent 19: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 2, 'Ease_of_Learning' = 4. Since 2 is not greater than 4, this respondent does not meet the criteria.
4. Respondent 39: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 4, 'Ease_of_Learning' = 2. Since 4 is greater than 2, this respondent meets the criteria.
5. Respondent 90: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 1, 'Ease_of_Learning' = 5. Since 1 is not greater than 5, this respondent does not meet the criteria.
6. Respondent 31: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 1, 'Ease_of_Learning' = 3. Since 1 is not greater than 3, this respondent does not meet the criteria.
7. Respondent 64: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 5, 'Ease_of_Learning' = 2. Since 5 is greater than 2, this respondent meets the criteria.
8. Respondent 4: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 1, 'Ease_of_Learning' = 2. Since 1 is not greater than 2, this respondent does not meet the criteria.
9. Respondent 5: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 1, 'Ease_of_Learning' = 5. Since 1 is not greater than 5, this respondent does not meet the criteria.

Therefore, the respondents whose 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score is greater than their 'Ease_of_Learning' score are 39 and 64.

The final answer is: 39, 64",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

Which respondents from the 'Junior' group have a 'Inconsistency' of 4 or more and a 'Confidence_in_Use' of less than 3?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to analyze the 'responses' section of the dataset and filter the respondents based on the given conditions.


After analyzing the data, we can see that there are no respondents from the 'Junior' group who have an 'Inconsistency' of 4 or more and a 'Confidence_in_Use' of less than 3.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose total score for 'Inconsistency' and 'Confidence_in_Use' is less than 6.
</task>","To find all respondents whose total score for 'Inconsistency' and 'Confidence_in_Use' is less than 6, we need to go through each respondent's answers in the 'responses' section and calculate the sum of their scores for these two questions.

Here are the calculations for each respondent:

1. Respondent 68: Inconsistency = 2, Confidence_in_Use = 4, Total = 6
2. Respondent 46: Inconsistency = 2, Confidence_in_Use = 3, Total = 5
3. Respondent 75: Inconsistency = 4, Confidence_in_Use = 4, Total = 8
4. Respondent 4: Inconsistency = 1, Confidence_in_Use = 5, Total = 6
5. Respondent 30: Inconsistency = 1, Confidence_in_Use = 5, Total = 6
6. Respondent 50: Inconsistency = 2, Confidence_in_Use = 4, Total = 6
7. Respondent 47: Inconsistency = 1, Confidence_in_Use = 5, Total = 6
8. Respondent 9: Inconsistency = 5, Confidence_in_Use = 2, Total = 7
9. Respondent 55: Inconsistency = 1, Confidence_in_Use = 2, Total = 3
10. Respondent 40: Inconsistency = 1, Confidence_in_Use = 5, Total = 6
11. Respondent 44: Inconsistency = 1, Confidence_in_Use = 1, Total = 2
12. Respondent 13: Inconsistency = 1, Confidence_in_Use = 5, Total = 6

The respondents with a total score less than 6 are:
- Respondent 46: Total = 5
- Respondent 55: Total = 3
- Respondent 44: Total = 2

Therefore, the respondents whose total score for 'Inconsistency' and 'Confidence_in_Use' is less than 6 are 46, 55, 44.",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
List all respondents whose 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score is greater than their 'Confidence_in_Use' score.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to compare the 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score with the 'Confidence_in_Use' score for each respondent and list those where 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' is greater.

From the provided data:

1. Respondent 71: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 1, 'Confidence_in_Use' = 4. Since 1 is not greater than 4, this respondent does not meet the criteria.
2. Respondent 43: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 1, 'Confidence_in_Use' = 5. Since 1 is not greater than 5, this respondent does not meet the criteria.
3. Respondent 17: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 1, 'Confidence_in_Use' = 5. Since 1 is not greater than 5, this respondent does not meet the criteria.
4. Respondent 44: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 4, 'Confidence_in_Use' = 1. Since 4 is greater than 1, this respondent meets the criteria.
5. Respondent 20: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 4, 'Confidence_in_Use' = 4. Since 4 is not greater than 4, this respondent does not meet the criteria.
6. Respondent 37: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 1, 'Confidence_in_Use' = 5. Since 1 is not greater than 5, this respondent does not meet the criteria.
7. Respondent 56: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 1, 'Confidence_in_Use' = 5. Since 1 is not greater than 5, this respondent does not meet the criteria.
8. Respondent 33: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 1, 'Confidence_in_Use' = 4. Since 1 is not greater than 4, this respondent does not meet the criteria.
9. Respondent 73: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 1, 'Confidence_in_Use' = 5. Since 1 is not greater than 5, this respondent does not meet the criteria.
10. Respondent 8: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 2, 'Confidence_in_Use' = 3. Since 2 is not greater than 3, this respondent does not meet the criteria.
11. Respondent 68: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 1, 'Confidence_in_Use' = 4. Since 1 is not greater than 4, this respondent does not meet the criteria.
12. Respondent 36: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 1, 'Confidence_in_Use' = 4. Since 1 is not greater than 4, this respondent does not meet the criteria.

Only Respondent 44 has a 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score greater than their 'Confidence_in_Use' score.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Find all respondents whose total score for 'Need_for_Technical_Support' and 'Ease_of_Learning' is less than 4.
</task>","To find the respondents whose total score for 'Need_for_Technical_Support' and 'Ease_of_Learning' is less than 4, we need to analyze each respondent's answers in the 'responses' section.


## Step 1: Identify the relevant questions and their scores
We are interested in 'Need_for_Technical_Support' and 'Ease_of_Learning'. We will go through each respondent's answers for these questions.


## Step 2: Calculate the total score for each respondent
For each respondent, we add the scores of 'Need_for_Technical_Support' and 'Ease_of_Learning'.


## Step 3: Determine which respondents have a total score less than 4
We compare the total score for each respondent to the threshold of 4.


## Step 4: List the respondents who meet the condition
After calculating and comparing, we list the IDs of respondents whose total score is less than 4.


Respondent 88: Need_for_Technical_Support = 2, Ease_of_Learning = 4, Total = 6
Respondent 78: Need_for_Technical_Support = 4, Ease_of_Learning = 3, Total = 7
Respondent 12: Need_for_Technical_Support = 2, Ease_of_Learning = 5, Total = 7
Respondent 80: Need_for_Technical_Support = 3, Ease_of_Learning = 5, Total = 8
Respondent 86: Need_for_Technical_Support = 5, Ease_of_Learning = 5, Total = 10
Respondent 82: Need_for_Technical_Support = 1, Ease_of_Learning = 5, Total = 6
Respondent 66: Need_for_Technical_Support = 1, Ease_of_Learning = 5, Total = 6
Respondent 5: Need_for_Technical_Support = 1, Ease_of_Learning = 5, Total = 6
Respondent 81: Need_for_Technical_Support = 2, Ease_of_Learning = 5, Total = 7
Respondent 48: Need_for_Technical_Support = 1, Ease_of_Learning = 5, Total = 6


None of the respondents have a total score less than 4 for 'Need_for_Technical_Support' and 'Ease_of_Learning'.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents from the 'Senior' group have a 'Confidence_in_Use' of 3 or more and a 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' of less than 4?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to analyze the 'responses' section of the provided data and filter the respondents based on the given conditions.


The conditions are:
1. The respondent must be from the 'Senior' group, which corresponds to option 'A' in the 'Group' question.
2. The respondent must have a 'Confidence_in_Use' score of 3 or more.
3. The respondent must have a 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score of less than 4.


Based on the provided data, we can see that there is only one respondent who meets the first condition (being from the 'Senior' group), which is respondent '55' and respondent '6'.


For respondent '55':
- 'Confidence_in_Use' score is 2, which does not meet the condition of having a score of 3 or more.
- 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score is 4, which does not meet the condition of having a score of less than 4.


For respondent '6':
- 'Confidence_in_Use' score is 5, which meets the condition of having a score of 3 or more.
- 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score is 1, which meets the condition of having a score of less than 4.


Therefore, the only respondent from the 'Senior' group who meets all the conditions is respondent '6'.


The final answer is: 6",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose total score for 'Integration_of_Functions' and 'Inconsistency' is less than 6.
</task>","To find all respondents whose total score for 'Integration_of_Functions' and 'Inconsistency' is less than 6, we need to analyze the 'responses' section of the provided data.


After analyzing the data, the respondents with a total score less than 6 for 'Integration_of_Functions' and 'Inconsistency' are:


75 (Integration_of_Functions: 2, Inconsistency: 4, Total: 6), 
82 (Integration_of_Functions: 4, Inconsistency: 1, Total: 5), 
27 (Integration_of_Functions: 2, Inconsistency: 4, Total: 6)


However, only respondent 82 has a total score less than 6.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'Ease_of_Learning' is greater than the average 'Ease_of_Learning' for their group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Ease_of_Learning' for each group and then identify the respondents whose 'Ease_of_Learning' score is greater than their group's average.

From the provided data, we can calculate the average 'Ease_of_Learning' for each group as follows:

1. **Group A**: Only respondent 89 belongs to this group, with an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 5. Thus, the average for Group A is 5.

2. **Group B**: Only respondent 36 belongs to this group, with an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 5. Thus, the average for Group B is 5.

3. **Group C**: Respondents 43, 22, 50, and 37 belong to this group, with 'Ease_of_Learning' scores of 3, 4, 4, and 5, respectively. The sum of these scores is 3 + 4 + 4 + 5 = 16, and there are 4 respondents. Thus, the average for Group C is 16 / 4 = 4.

4. **Group D**: Respondents 49, 30, 74, and 71 belong to this group, with 'Ease_of_Learning' scores of 4, 5, 5, and 5, respectively. The sum of these scores is 4 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 19, and there are 4 respondents. Thus, the average for Group D is 19 / 4 = 4.75.

Now, we compare each respondent's 'Ease_of_Learning' score to their group's average:

- **Group A (Average = 5)**: Respondent 89 has a score of 5, which is not greater than the average.

- **Group B (Average = 5)**: Respondent 36 has a score of 5, which is not greater than the average.

- **Group C (Average = 4)**: 
  - Respondent 43 has a score of 3, which is not greater than the average.
  - Respondent 22 has a score of 4, which is not greater than the average.
  - Respondent 50 has a score of 4, which is not greater than the average.
  - Respondent 37 has a score of 5, which is greater than the average.

- **Group D (Average = 4.75)**: 
  - Respondent 49 has a score of 4, which is not greater than the average.
  - Respondent 30 has a score of 5, which is greater than the average.
  - Respondent 74 has a score of 5, which is greater than the average.
  - Respondent 71 has a score of 5, which is greater than the average.

Therefore, the respondents whose 'Ease_of_Learning' is greater than the average for their group are 37, 30, 74, and 71.

The final answer is: $\boxed{37, 30, 74, 71}$",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents have an 'Ease_of_Use' score that is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score for their group?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Ease_of_Use' score for each group and then identify the respondents whose 'Ease_of_Use' score exceeds this average for their respective group.

Given the data, let's calculate the average 'Ease_of_Use' score for each group:

1. **Group A (Senior)**: There are no respondents in Group A, so we cannot calculate an average.
2. **Group B (Junior)**:
   - Respondent 36: Ease_of_Use = 5
   - Respondent 32: Ease_of_Use = 5
   - Respondent 14: Ease_of_Use = 4
   - Respondent 12: Ease_of_Use = 5
   - Average for Group B = (5 + 5 + 4 + 5) / 4 = 19 / 4 = 4.75
3. **Group C (Middle)**:
   - Respondent 82: Ease_of_Use = 4
   - Respondent 4: Ease_of_Use = 5
   - Respondent 87: Ease_of_Use = 3
   - Respondent 70: Ease_of_Use = 5
   - Average for Group C = (4 + 5 + 3 + 5) / 4 = 17 / 4 = 4.25
4. **Group D (Intern)**:
   - Respondent 15: Ease_of_Use = 4
   - Respondent 29: Ease_of_Use = 4
   - Respondent 18: Ease_of_Use = 4
   - Average for Group D = (4 + 4 + 4) / 3 = 12 / 3 = 4

Now, let's identify the respondents whose 'Ease_of_Use' score is higher than the average for their group:

- **Group B**: Since the average is 4.75, only scores of 5 exceed this average. Thus, respondents 36, 32, and 12 have scores higher than the average.
- **Group C**: The average is 4.25, so scores of 5 exceed this average. Thus, respondents 4 and 70 have scores higher than the average.
- **Group D**: The average is 4, so no one exceeds this average since all have a score of 4.

Therefore, the respondents with an 'Ease_of_Use' score higher than the average for their group are:

36, 32, 12, 4, 70",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondents have a total positive usability score ('Ease_of_Use' + 'Integration_of_Functions') that is lower than the average for all respondents in a different group?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the total positive usability score for each respondent, which is the sum of 'Ease_of_Use' and 'Integration_of_Functions'. Then, we need to calculate the average of this score for each group. Finally, we compare each respondent's score with the average score of the other groups to find those who have a lower score.

Here are the steps and calculations:

1. **Calculate the total positive usability score for each respondent**:
   - Respondent 5: 5 (Ease_of_Use) + 5 (Integration_of_Functions) = 10
   - Respondent 37: 5 + 5 = 10
   - Respondent 90: 5 + 5 = 10
   - Respondent 19: 5 + 3 = 8
   - Respondent 60: 5 + 4 = 9
   - Respondent 48: 5 + 5 = 10
   - Respondent 86: 1 + 5 = 6
   - Respondent 13: 5 + 5 = 10
   - Respondent 59: 5 + 5 = 10
   - Respondent 77: 5 + 4 = 9
   - Respondent 64: 2 + 2 = 4
   - Respondent 78: 3 + 4 = 7

2. **Determine the group for each respondent**:
   - Respondent 5: C
   - Respondent 37: C
   - Respondent 90: D
   - Respondent 19: C
   - Respondent 60: D
   - Respondent 48: D
   - Respondent 86: A
   - Respondent 13: A
   - Respondent 59: A
   - Respondent 77: D
   - Respondent 64: D
   - Respondent 78: D

3. **Calculate the average total positive usability score for each group**:
   - Group A: (6 + 10 + 10) / 3 = 26 / 3 = 8.67
   - Group C: (10 + 10 + 8) / 3 = 28 / 3 = 9.33
   - Group D: (10 + 9 + 10 + 9 + 4 + 7) / 6 = 49 / 6 = 8.17

4. **Compare each respondent's score with the average score of the other groups**:
   - For respondents in Group A (average of other groups: (9.33 + 8.17) / 2 = 8.75), we compare their scores with 8.75. Respondent 86 with a score of 6 is lower.
   - For respondents in Group C (average of other groups: (8.67 + 8.17) / 2 = 8.42), we compare their scores with 8.42. Respondent 19 with a score of 8 is lower.
   - For respondents in Group D (average of other groups: (8.67 + 9.33) / 2 = 9), we compare their scores with 9. Respondents 60 (score 9), 64 (score 4), and 78 (score 7) are lower.

Given the comparison, the respondents who have a total positive usability score lower than the average for all respondents in a different group are:
- Respondent 86 (Group A)
- Respondent 19 (Group C)
- Respondents 60, 64, and 78 (Group D)

However, the task asks for respondents whose score is lower than the average of a different group, and based on the calculations:
- The average for Group A is 8.67, and for Group C is 9.33, and for Group D is 8.17.
- Respondent 86 (Group A) has a score of 6, which is lower than the averages of both Group C (9.33) and Group D (8.17).
- Respondent 19 (Group C) has a score of 8, which is lower than the average of Group A (8.67) but higher than the average of Group D (8.17). It's actually lower than the average of Group A, considering the correct interpretation of the task.
- Respondent 60 (Group D) has a score of 9, which is not lower than any group's average.
- Respondents 64 and 78 (Group D) have scores of 4 and 7, respectively, which are lower than the averages of both Group A (8.67) and Group C (9.33).

Therefore, the respondents who meet the criteria based on the task's requirement for having a score lower than the average of a different group are:
- Respondent 86 (Group A)
- Respondent 19 (Group C)
- Respondents 64 and 78 (Group D)

The final answer is: $\boxed{19, 64, 78, 86}$",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents whose 'Need_for_Technical_Support' is within 2 point of the highest 'Integration_of_Functions' for their group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to understand the 'questions' schema and then analyze the 'responses' data accordingly.

1. **Understanding the Schema:**
   - The 'Group' question is a multiple-choice question with options A (Senior), B (Junior), C (Middle), and D (Intern).
   - 'Need_for_Technical_Support' and 'Integration_of_Functions' are both Likert scale questions ranging from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree).

2. **Analyzing the Data:**
   - We need to find the highest 'Integration_of_Functions' score for each group.
   - Then, we identify respondents whose 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score is within 2 points of this highest 'Integration_of_Functions' score for their respective group.

Let's calculate the highest 'Integration_of_Functions' score for each group:

- **Group A (Senior):** Respondent 67 has an 'Integration_of_Functions' score of 5.
- **Group B (Junior):** Respondent 23 has an 'Integration_of_Functions' score of 4.
- **Group C (Middle):** Respondents 53 and 70 have an 'Integration_of_Functions' score of 5.
- **Group D (Intern):** Respondents 15, 29, 49, and 90 have 'Integration_of_Functions' scores of 5.

Now, let's find respondents whose 'Need_for_Technical_Support' is within 2 points of the highest 'Integration_of_Functions' for their group:

- **Group A (Senior):** The highest 'Integration_of_Functions' is 5. Respondent 67 has a 'Need_for_Technical_Support' of 1, which is within 2 points (since 5 - 2 = 3 and 1 is not within this range, but considering the context, it seems there might be a misunderstanding in the initial calculation. Given the scores, we should look for scores that are 3 or higher for 'Need_for_Technical_Support' to be within 2 points of the highest 'Integration_of_Functions' score of 5. Thus, respondent 67 does not fit this criterion based on the initial incorrect interpretation).
- **Group B (Junior):** The highest 'Integration_of_Functions' is 4. Respondent 23 has a 'Need_for_Technical_Support' of 3, which is within 2 points of 4.
- **Group C (Middle):** The highest 'Integration_of_Functions' is 5. Respondents 53 and 70 have 'Need_for_Technical_Support' scores of 1, which are not within 2 points of 5.
- **Group D (Intern):** The highest 'Integration_of_Functions' is 5. Respondent 90 has a 'Need_for_Technical_Support' of 2, which is within 2 points of 5. Respondents 15, 29, and 49 have 'Need_for_Technical_Support' scores of 1, 1, and 4, respectively. Respondent 49's score is within 2 points of 5.

Given the corrected understanding of ""within 2 points"" and re-evaluating the data:

- For Group A, no respondents fit because their 'Need_for_Technical_Support' scores are too low compared to the highest 'Integration_of_Functions' score.
- For Group B, respondent 23 fits.
- For Group C, no respondents fit because their 'Need_for_Technical_Support' scores are too low.
- For Group D, respondents 49 and 90 fit because their 'Need_for_Technical_Support' scores are within 2 points of the highest 'Integration_of_Functions' score for their group.

Thus, the respondents whose 'Need_for_Technical_Support' is within 2 points of the highest 'Integration_of_Functions' for their group are 23, 49, 90. 

The final answer is: $\boxed{23, 49, 90}$",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents have an 'Ease_of_Use' score that is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score for their group?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Ease_of_Use' score for each group and then compare each respondent's score to the average of their respective group.

From the provided data, we can calculate the average 'Ease_of_Use' score for each group as follows:

1. **Group A**:
   - Respondent 35: Ease_of_Use = 1
   - Respondent 11: Ease_of_Use = 5
   - Average for Group A = (1 + 5) / 2 = 3

2. **Group B**:
   - Respondent 44: Ease_of_Use = 5
   - Respondent 3: Ease_of_Use = 3
   - Average for Group B = (5 + 3) / 2 = 4

3. **Group C**:
   - Respondent 54: Ease_of_Use = 5
   - Respondent 63: Ease_of_Use = 5
   - Respondent 33: Ease_of_Use = 5
   - Respondent 39: Ease_of_Use = 1
   - Respondent 62: Ease_of_Use = 5
   - Average for Group C = (5 + 5 + 5 + 1 + 5) / 5 = 4.2

4. **Group D**:
   - Respondent 10: Ease_of_Use = 4
   - Since there's only one respondent in Group D, the average is 4.

Now, let's identify which respondents have an 'Ease_of_Use' score higher than the average for their group:

- **Group A**: Average is 3. Respondent 11 has a score of 5, which is higher than the average.
- **Group B**: Average is 4. No respondents have a score higher than the average.
- **Group C**: Average is 4.2. Respondents 54, 63, 33, and 62 all have a score of 5, which is higher than the average.
- **Group D**: Since there's only one respondent, there's no comparison to be made within the group.

Therefore, the respondents with an 'Ease_of_Use' score higher than the average for their group are:

11, 54, 63, 33, 62",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondents have a total positive usability score ('Ease_of_Use' + 'Integration_of_Functions') that is lower than the average for all respondents in a different group?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the total positive usability score for each respondent, which is the sum of 'Ease_of_Use' and 'Integration_of_Functions'. Then, we need to calculate the average of this score for each group. Finally, we compare each respondent's score with the average score of the other groups to find those who have a lower score.

Given the data:

1. Calculate the total positive usability score for each respondent.
2. Calculate the average total positive usability score for each group.
3. Compare each respondent's score with the average of the other groups.

**Step 1: Calculate the total positive usability score for each respondent.**

- Respondent 10: 4 (Ease_of_Use) + 5 (Integration_of_Functions) = 9
- Respondent 52: 4 + 4 = 8
- Respondent 6: 4 + 5 = 9
- Respondent 76: 5 + 4 = 9
- Respondent 30: 5 + 5 = 10
- Respondent 82: 4 + 4 = 8
- Respondent 67: 5 + 5 = 10
- Respondent 20: 5 + 4 = 9

**Step 2: Calculate the average total positive usability score for each group.**

- Group A: (4+4+5+5+5) / 5 = 23 / 5 = 4.6 (Incorrect calculation - correct calculation below)
  - Correct calculation for Group A: (9+9+9+10+10) / 5 = 47 / 5 = 9.4
- Group C: (8+9) / 2 = 17 / 2 = 8.5
- Group D: (9+10) / 2 = 19 / 2 = 9.5

Corrected calculations for averages:
- The calculation for Group A was incorrect. Let's correct it and also calculate for Group D and ensure Group C's calculation is correct.
- Group A respondents: 52 (8), 6 (9), 76 (9), 67 (10), 
- Group A correct calculation: (8+9+9+10+4 (from 52, 6, 76, 67, and actually 4 from another A which was missed)) is not correct since we don't have a 4, we actually have: 52 (8), 6 (9), 76 (9), 67 (10), and another A which is 4+5=9 for respondent 52 is A but another A is needed for accurate count: The correct list for A should include all As which are 52, 6, 76, 67, and another is actually not present but we see 4 As, so we use the scores we have for A: 8 (52), 9 (6), 9 (76), 10 (67), and we missed one more A which is actually not missed but we need to consider all scores for A correctly: The scores for A are indeed 8, 9, 9, 10, and we need to find the last A to calculate correctly. 
- Let's correctly identify and calculate for A:
  - Respondent 52 (A): 8
  - Respondent 6 (A): 9
  - Respondent 76 (A): 9
  - Respondent 67 (A): 10
  - And the last A is actually from the question stem which we derived the groups from, so we need to correctly account for all As which are these four since the rest are either D or C.
- Correct calculation for Group A: (8+9+9+10) / 4 = 36 / 4 = 9
- Group D: (9+10) / 2 = 19 / 2 = 9.5
- Group C: (8+9) / 2 = 17 / 2 = 8.5

**Step 3: Compare each respondent's score with the average of the other groups.**

- For Group A (average = 9), compare with Group C (8.5) and Group D (9.5):
  - Respondents in A with scores lower than 8.5 (Group C's average) are none since the lowest in A is 8 which is very close but not lower than 8.5, and lower than 9.5 (Group D's average) are those with scores less than 9.5 which includes all in A (8, 9, 9, 10) except none because 8 is less than 9.5 and 9 is less than 9.5, and 10 is not less than 9.5 but exactly one is 10 which does not meet the criteria.
- For Group C (average = 8.5), compare with Group A (9) and Group D (9.5):
  - Respondents in C with scores lower than 9 (Group A's average) are 8 (82), and lower than 9.5 (Group D's average) are both 8 (82) and 9 (20).
- For Group D (average = 9.5), compare with Group A (9) and Group C (8.5):
  - Respondents in D with scores lower than 9 (Group A's average) are none since both scores are 9 or higher, and lower than 8.5 (Group C's average) is not applicable since we look for lower than the other group's average which is higher than C's.

Given the corrected understanding and calculations, the task asks for respondents with a total positive usability score lower than the average for all respondents in a different group. 

- From Group A, the score 8 is lower than Group D's average (9.5).
- From Group C, both scores (8 and 9) are lower than Group A's and Group D's averages.
- From Group D, no scores are lower than Group A's average since both are 9 or higher.

Thus, the respondents who meet the criteria are:
- Respondent 52 (Group A) because their score (8) is lower than Group D's average (9.5).
- Respondent 82 (Group C) because their score (8) is lower than both Group A's (9) and Group D's (9.5) averages.
- Respondent 20 (Group C) because their score (9) is lower than Group D's average (9.5) but not lower than Group A's average, however, it was incorrectly considered in the step above due to a miscalculation of its relevance to being lower than A's average which it is not, but it is relevant for being lower than D's which it is not since 9 is not less than 9.5, it's actually equal or less in a different context but here specifically it does not meet the ""lower than"" criteria for D but does for A in a general comparison but that was a misinterpretation.

Correctly, based on the task's specific wording and the calculations:
- The actual comparison actually seeks those lower than another group's average, not the group they are in, but another group. 
- So, for A, we compare to C and D, for C to A and D, and for D to A and C.
- The correct interpretation should focus on the exact question: Which respondents have a total positive usability score ('Ease_of_Use' + 'Integration_of_Functions') that is lower than the average for all respondents in a different group?

Given this, the correct list based on recalculated averages and correct comparisons should include:
- Respondents from A with scores lower than the average of C or D.
- Respondents from C with scores lower than the average of A or D.
- Respondents from D with scores lower than the average of A or C.

The final answer is: $\boxed{52, 82}$",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondents have a total positive usability score ('Ease_of_Use' + 'Integration_of_Functions') that is lower than the average for all respondents in a different group?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the total positive usability score for each respondent, which is the sum of 'Ease_of_Use' and 'Integration_of_Functions'. Then, we need to calculate the average of this score for each group. Finally, we compare each respondent's score with the average score of the other groups to find those who have a lower score.

Here are the steps and calculations:

1. **Calculate Total Positive Usability Score for Each Respondent:**

| Respondent ID | Ease_of_Use | Integration_of_Functions | Total Score |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 46 | 1 | 1 | 2 |
| 9 | 1 | 1 | 2 |
| 56 | 4 | 5 | 9 |
| 71 | 5 | 4 | 9 |
| 59 | 5 | 5 | 10 |
| 74 | 5 | 5 | 10 |
| 44 | 5 | 2 | 7 |
| 33 | 5 | 5 | 10 |
| 66 | 5 | 5 | 10 |
| 50 | 5 | 5 | 10 |
| 51 | 5 | 5 | 10 |
| 79 | 5 | 5 | 10 |

2. **Group Respondents by 'Group' and Calculate Average Total Score for Each Group:**

- **Group A:** Respondents 46, 56, 59
  - Total Scores: 2, 9, 10
  - Average = (2 + 9 + 10) / 3 = 21 / 3 = 7

- **Group B:** Respondents 44, 66, 79
  - Total Scores: 7, 10, 10
  - Average = (7 + 10 + 10) / 3 = 27 / 3 = 9

- **Group C:** Respondents 9, 33, 50, 51
  - Total Scores: 2, 10, 10, 10
  - Average = (2 + 10 + 10 + 10) / 4 = 32 / 4 = 8

- **Group D:** Respondents 71, 74
  - Total Scores: 9, 10
  - Average = (9 + 10) / 2 = 19 / 2 = 9.5

3. **Identify Respondents with Total Score Lower than Average of Other Groups:**

- For **Group A (Average = 7)**, compare with averages of other groups:
  - Respondent 46 (Score = 2) is lower than the averages of Group B (9), Group C (8), and Group D (9.5).
  - Respondents 56 and 59 have scores higher than the average of at least one other group, so they are not included.

- For **Group B (Average = 9)**, compare with averages of other groups:
  - No respondent has a score lower than the average of Group A (7), but we look for scores lower than the averages of Group C (8) and Group D (9.5).
  - Respondent 44 (Score = 7) is lower than the averages of Group C (8) and Group D (9.5).

- For **Group C (Average = 8)**, compare with averages of other groups:
  - Respondent 9 (Score = 2) is lower than the averages of Group A (7), Group B (9), and Group D (9.5).

- For **Group D (Average = 9.5)**, compare with averages of other groups:
  - No respondent has a score lower than the average of Group A (7), Group B (9), or Group C (8).

**Respondents with Total Score Lower than Average of Other Groups:**

- Respondent 46 (Group A) - Score = 2, lower than Group B, C, and D averages.
- Respondent 44 (Group B) - Score = 7, lower than Group C and D averages.
- Respondent 9 (Group C) - Score = 2, lower than Group A, B, and D averages.

Therefore, the respondents who have a total positive usability score lower than the average for all respondents in a different group are **46, 9, 44**.",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondents have a total positive usability score ('Ease_of_Use' + 'Integration_of_Functions') that is lower than the average for all respondents in a different group?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the total positive usability score for each respondent, which is the sum of 'Ease_of_Use' and 'Integration_of_Functions'. Then, we need to calculate the average of this score for each group. Finally, we compare each respondent's score with the average score of the other groups to find those who have a lower score.

Here are the steps and calculations:

1. **Calculate Total Positive Usability Score for Each Respondent:**

| Respondent ID | Ease_of_Use | Integration_of_Functions | Total Score |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 71 | 5 | 4 | 9 |
| 41 | 5 | 5 | 10 |
| 17 | 5 | 5 | 10 |
| 72 | 5 | 5 | 10 |
| 69 | 5 | 5 | 10 |
| 39 | 1 | 5 | 6 |
| 65 | 5 | 2 | 7 |
| 25 | 3 | 3 | 6 |

2. **Group Respondents by 'Group' and Calculate Average Total Score for Each Group:**

- **Group A:** Respondents 72, 65
  - Total Scores: 10, 7
  - Average: (10 + 7) / 2 = 8.5
- **Group B:** Respondent 69
  - Total Score: 10
  - Average: 10
- **Group C:** Respondents 17, 39
  - Total Scores: 10, 6
  - Average: (10 + 6) / 2 = 8
- **Group D:** Respondents 71, 41, 25
  - Total Scores: 9, 10, 6
  - Average: (9 + 10 + 6) / 3 = 8.33

3. **Compare Each Respondent's Score with the Average of Other Groups:**

- For **Group A (Average = 8.5):**
  - Respondent 72 (Score = 10) is not lower than any other group's average.
  - Respondent 65 (Score = 7) is lower than Group B's average (10).
- For **Group B (Average = 10):**
  - Respondent 69 (Score = 10) is not lower than any other group's average.
- For **Group C (Average = 8):**
  - Respondent 17 (Score = 10) is not lower than any other group's average.
  - Respondent 39 (Score = 6) is lower than Group A's average (8.5), Group B's average (10), and Group D's average (8.33).
- For **Group D (Average = 8.33):**
  - Respondent 71 (Score = 9) is not lower than any other group's average.
  - Respondent 41 (Score = 10) is not lower than any other group's average.
  - Respondent 25 (Score = 6) is lower than Group A's average (8.5), Group B's average (10), and Group C's average (8).

**Respondents with a Total Positive Usability Score Lower than the Average for All Respondents in a Different Group:**

- 65 (Group A) because their score (7) is lower than Group B's average (10).
- 39 (Group C) because their score (6) is lower than Group A's average (8.5), Group B's average (10), and Group D's average (8.33).
- 25 (Group D) because their score (6) is lower than Group A's average (8.5), Group B's average (10), and Group C's average (8).

Therefore, the respondents who meet the criteria are **65, 39, 25**.",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents whose 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' is within 2 point of the highest 'Integration_of_Functions' for their group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to understand the 'questions' schema and then analyze the 'responses' data accordingly.

1. **Understanding the Schema:**
   - The 'questions' section defines the meaning of each question and its possible answers. 
   - 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' and 'Integration_of_Functions' are both Likert scale questions (1-5), where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" and 5 means ""Strongly Agree"".
   - 'Group' is a multiple-choice question with options A (Senior), B (Junior), C (Middle), and D (Intern).

2. **Analyzing the Data:**
   - We need to find the highest 'Integration_of_Functions' score for each group.
   - Then, we identify respondents whose 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score is within 2 points of this highest 'Integration_of_Functions' score for their respective group.

3. **Calculating Highest 'Integration_of_Functions' for Each Group:**
   - **Group A:** The highest 'Integration_of_Functions' score is 5 (from respondent 42 and 6).
   - **Group B:** The highest 'Integration_of_Functions' score is 5 (from respondents 36 and 66).
   - **Group C:** The highest 'Integration_of_Functions' score is 5 (from respondent 53) and 4 (from respondents 88).
   - **Group D:** The highest 'Integration_of_Functions' score is 5 (from respondents 15, 45, and 7) and 4 (from respondent 71).

4. **Identifying Respondents:**
   - For each group, we look for respondents with 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' scores within 2 points of the highest 'Integration_of_Functions' score.
   - **Group A:** Highest 'Integration_of_Functions' is 5. Respondents with 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' scores of 3, 4, or 5 are within 2 points. Respondent 42 has a score of 3, and respondent 6 has a score of 1, which is not within 2 points.
   - **Group B:** Highest 'Integration_of_Functions' is 5. Respondents with 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' scores of 3, 4, or 5 are within 2 points. Respondent 36 has a score of 1, and respondent 66 has a score of 2, which are not within 2 points.
   - **Group C:** Highest 'Integration_of_Functions' is 5. Respondents with 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' scores of 3, 4, or 5 are within 2 points. Respondent 53 has a score of 1, respondent 88 has a score of 1, and respondent 9 has a score of 4, which is within 2 points of the highest score for their group.
   - **Group D:** Highest 'Integration_of_Functions' is 5. Respondents with 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' scores of 3, 4, or 5 are within 2 points. Respondents 15 (score 2), 45 (score 1), 7 (score 1), and 71 (score 1) are not within 2 points.

5. **Listing Respondents:**
   - Based on the analysis, the respondents whose 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' is within 2 points of the highest 'Integration_of_Functions' for their group are:
     - Respondent 42 (Group A, 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 3)
     - Respondent 9 (Group C, 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 4)

The final answer is: $\boxed{42, 9}$",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents whose 'System_Complexity' is within 1 point of the highest 'Cumbersome_to_Use' for their group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to understand the 'questions' schema and then analyze the 'responses' data accordingly.

1. **Understanding the Schema:**
   - The 'questions' section defines the meaning of each question and its possible answers. 
   - 'System_Complexity' and 'Cumbersome_to_Use' are both Likert scale questions with scores ranging from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree).
   - 'Group' is a multiple-choice question with options A (Senior), B (Junior), C (Middle), and D (Intern).

2. **Analyzing the Data:**
   - We need to find the highest 'Cumbersome_to_Use' score for each group.
   - Then, we identify respondents whose 'System_Complexity' score is within 1 point of this highest 'Cumbersome_to_Use' score for their respective group.

3. **Calculating Highest 'Cumbersome_to_Use' per Group:**
   - **Group A (Senior):** Respondents 35, 89, and 11. Their 'Cumbersome_to_Use' scores are 5, 1, and 1, respectively. The highest score is 5.
   - **Group B (Junior):** Respondents 47, 32, and 61. Their 'Cumbersome_to_Use' scores are 1, 1, and 5, respectively. The highest score is 5.
   - **Group C (Middle):** Respondents 82 and 43. Their 'Cumbersome_to_Use' scores are 2 and 1, respectively. The highest score is 2.
   - **Group D (Intern):** Respondent 64. Their 'Cumbersome_to_Use' score is 4. The highest score is 4.

4. **Identifying Respondents:**
   - For **Group A**, the highest 'Cumbersome_to_Use' is 5. Respondents with 'System_Complexity' within 1 point (4 or 5) are: 35 (score 5).
   - For **Group B**, the highest 'Cumbersome_to_Use' is 5. Respondents with 'System_Complexity' within 1 point (4 or 5) are: 61 (score 5).
   - For **Group C**, the highest 'Cumbersome_to_Use' is 2. Respondents with 'System_Complexity' within 1 point (1, 2, or 3) are: 82 (score 1), 43 (score 1).
   - For **Group D**, the highest 'Cumbersome_to_Use' is 4. Respondents with 'System_Complexity' within 1 point (3, 4, or 5) are: 64 (score 3).

5. **Listing Respondents:**
   - Based on the analysis, the respondents whose 'System_Complexity' is within 1 point of the highest 'Cumbersome_to_Use' for their group are: 35, 61, 82, 43, 64.

The final answer is: $\boxed{35, 61, 82, 43, 64}$",False
