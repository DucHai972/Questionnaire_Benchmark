</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents whose 'System_Complexity' score is greater than their 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to compare the 'System_Complexity' score with the 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score for each respondent and list those where 'System_Complexity' is greater.

From the responses given:

- Respondent 26: System_Complexity = 2, Need_for_Technical_Support = 2. Since 2 is not greater than 2, Respondent 26 does not meet the criteria.
- Respondent 85: System_Complexity = 1, Need_for_Technical_Support = 1. Since 1 is not greater than 1, Respondent 85 does not meet the criteria.
- Respondent 27: System_Complexity = 4, Need_for_Technical_Support = 4. Since 4 is not greater than 4, Respondent 27 does not meet the criteria.
- Respondent 56: System_Complexity = 2, Need_for_Technical_Support = 1. Since 2 is greater than 1, Respondent 56 meets the criteria.
- Respondent 77: System_Complexity = 1, Need_for_Technical_Support = 1. Since 1 is not greater than 1, Respondent 77 does not meet the criteria.

Therefore, the respondents whose 'System_Complexity' score is greater than their 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score are:

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents from the 'Junior' group have a 'System_Complexity' of 4 or more and a 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' of less than 4?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to analyze the 'responses' section and find the respondents who belong to the 'Junior' group, have a 'System_Complexity' of 4 or more, and a 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' of less than 4.


According to the 'questions' section, the 'Group' field is a MCQ with the following options: 
""A. Senior 
B. Junior 
C. Middle 
D. Intern""


We will look for respondents with 'Group' equal to 'B' (which corresponds to 'Junior').


After examining the 'responses' section, we can see that:


Respondent 23 has 'Group' equal to 'B', 'System_Complexity' equal to 1, and 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' equal to 3. Although the 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' is less than 4, the 'System_Complexity' is less than 4.


No other respondents from the 'Junior' group have a 'System_Complexity' of 4 or more and a 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' of less than 4.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents whose 'System_Complexity' score is greater than their 'Ease_of_Use' score.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to compare the 'System_Complexity' score with the 'Ease_of_Use' score for each respondent and list those where 'System_Complexity' is greater.

From the provided data:

- Respondent 2: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 4. System_Complexity is not greater.
- Respondent 61: System_Complexity = 5, Ease_of_Use = 2. System_Complexity is greater.
- Respondent 15: System_Complexity = 2, Ease_of_Use = 4. System_Complexity is not greater.
- Respondent 51: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5. System_Complexity is not greater.
- Respondent 19: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5. System_Complexity is not greater.
- Respondent 88: System_Complexity = 2, Ease_of_Use = 5. System_Complexity is not greater.
- Respondent 6: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 4. System_Complexity is not greater.
- Respondent 18: System_Complexity = 1, Ease_of_Use = 4. System_Complexity is not greater.
- Respondent 69: System_Complexity = 4, Ease_of_Use = 5. System_Complexity is not greater.

Only Respondent 61 has a 'System_Complexity' score greater than their 'Ease_of_Use' score.

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

Which respondents from the 'Junior' group have a 'Inconsistency' of 4 or more and a 'Confidence_in_Use' of less than 3?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to analyze the 'responses' section and find the respondents who belong to the 'Junior' group, have an 'Inconsistency' score of 4 or more, and a 'Confidence_in_Use' score of less than 3.


From the 'questions' section, we know that the 'Group' field is a MCQ with options A. Senior, B. Junior, C. Middle, D. Intern. We are interested in respondents with Group 'B. Junior'.


Looking at the 'responses' section, we can see that:


- Respondent 36 has Group 'B' (which corresponds to 'Junior'), Inconsistency '1', and Confidence_in_Use '4'. This respondent does not meet the criteria because their Inconsistency score is less than 4 and their Confidence_in_Use score is not less than 3.


- Respondent 69 has Group 'B' (which corresponds to 'Junior'), Inconsistency '5', and Confidence_in_Use '4'. This respondent does not meet the criteria because their Confidence_in_Use score is not less than 3.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose total score for 'Inconsistency' and 'Confidence_in_Use' is less than 6.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

Find all respondents whose total score for 'Cumbersome_to_Use' and 'Integration_of_Functions' is less than 6.
</task>","To find all respondents whose total score for 'Cumbersome_to_Use' and 'Integration_of_Functions' is less than 6, we need to calculate the sum of these two scores for each respondent and then identify those with a total score less than 6.

1. Respondent 27: Cumbersome_to_Use = 5, Integration_of_Functions = 2, Total = 7
2. Respondent 34: Cumbersome_to_Use = 1, Integration_of_Functions = 4, Total = 5
3. Respondent 50: Cumbersome_to_Use = 2, Integration_of_Functions = 5, Total = 7
4. Respondent 4: Cumbersome_to_Use = 1, Integration_of_Functions = 3, Total = 4
5. Respondent 25: Cumbersome_to_Use = 3, Integration_of_Functions = 3, Total = 6
6. Respondent 29: Cumbersome_to_Use = 1, Integration_of_Functions = 4, Total = 5

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'Ease_of_Learning' is greater than the average 'Ease_of_Learning' for their group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Ease_of_Learning' for each group and then identify the respondents whose 'Ease_of_Learning' score exceeds this average for their respective group.

Given the data:

1. Respondent 49: Group D, Ease_of_Learning: 4
2. Respondent 43: Group C, Ease_of_Learning: 3
3. Respondent 30: Group D, Ease_of_Learning: 5
4. Respondent 22: Group C, Ease_of_Learning: 4
5. Respondent 50: Group C, Ease_of_Learning: 4
6. Respondent 74: Group D, Ease_of_Learning: 5
7. Respondent 89: Group A, Ease_of_Learning: 5
8. Respondent 37: Group C, Ease_of_Learning: 5
9. Respondent 71: Group D, Ease_of_Learning: 5
10. Respondent 36: Group B, Ease_of_Learning: 5

Let's calculate the average 'Ease_of_Learning' for each group:

- Group A: (5) / 1 = 5
- Group B: (5) / 1 = 5
- Group C: (3 + 4 + 4 + 5) / 4 = 16 / 4 = 4
- Group D: (4 + 5 + 5 + 5) / 4 = 19 / 4 = 4.75

Now, let's identify the respondents whose 'Ease_of_Learning' is greater than the average for their group:

- Group A: None (since the average is 5 and the only respondent scored 5, which is not greater than the average)
- Group B: None (since the average is 5 and the only respondent scored 5, which is not greater than the average)
- Group C: Respondent 37 (Ease_of_Learning: 5), because 5 is greater than the group average of 4.
- Group D: Respondents 30 (Ease_of_Learning: 5), 74 (Ease_of_Learning: 5), and 71 (Ease_of_Learning: 5), because 5 is greater than the group average of 4.75.

Therefore, the respondents whose 'Ease_of_Learning' is greater than the average 'Ease_of_Learning' for their group are:

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents have an 'Ease_of_Use' score that is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score for their group?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Ease_of_Use' score for each group and then compare each respondent's score to their group's average.

From the 'questions' section, we understand that 'Group' is a MCQ field with options A. Senior, B. Junior, C. Middle, and D. Intern. 'Ease_of_Use' is a Likert scale from 1 to 5.

Let's calculate the average 'Ease_of_Use' score for each group based on the provided responses:

1. Group A (Senior): There are no respondents in Group A, so we cannot calculate an average.
2. Group B (Junior):
   - Respondent 36: Ease_of_Use = 5
   - Respondent 32: Ease_of_Use = 5
   - Respondent 14: Ease_of_Use = 4
   Average for Group B = (5 + 5 + 4) / 3 = 14 / 3 = 4.67
3. Group C (Middle):
   - Respondent 82: Ease_of_Use = 4
   - Respondent 4: Ease_of_Use = 5
   - Respondent 87: Ease_of_Use = 3
   - Respondent 70: Ease_of_Use = 5
   Average for Group C = (4 + 5 + 3 + 5) / 4 = 17 / 4 = 4.25
4. Group D (Intern):
   - Respondent 15: Ease_of_Use = 4
   - Respondent 29: Ease_of_Use = 4
   - Respondent 18: Ease_of_Use = 4
   - Respondent 12: Ease_of_Use = 5
   Average for Group D = (4 + 4 + 4 + 5) / 4 = 17 / 4 = 4.25

Now, let's identify respondents whose 'Ease_of_Use' score is higher than their group's average:

- Group B: 
  - Respondent 36 (5) and Respondent 32 (5) are higher than or equal to the group average (4.67), but since the question asks for scores higher than the average, neither of these respondents qualify because their scores are not strictly higher than the average.
- Group C:
  - Respondent 4 (5) and Respondent 70 (5) have scores higher than the group average (4.25).
- Group D:
  - Respondent 12 (5) has a score higher than the group average (4.25).

Therefore, the respondents with an 'Ease_of_Use' score higher than the average for their group are:

4, 70, 12",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents have a total positive usability score ('Ease_of_Use' + 'Integration_of_Functions') that is lower than the average for all respondents in a different group?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the total positive usability score for each respondent, which is the sum of 'Ease_of_Use' and 'Integration_of_Functions'. Then, we calculate the average of this score for each group. Finally, we compare each respondent's score with the average score of the other groups to find those who have a score lower than the average of a different group.

1. **Calculate Total Positive Usability Score for Each Respondent:**

Respondent 5: 5 (Ease_of_Use) + 5 (Integration_of_Functions) = 10  
Respondent 37: 5 + 5 = 10  
Respondent 90: 5 + 5 = 10  
Respondent 19: 5 + 3 = 8  
Respondent 60: 5 + 4 = 9  
Respondent 48: 5 + 5 = 10  
Respondent 86: 1 + 5 = 6  
Respondent 13: 5 + 5 = 10  
Respondent 59: 5 + 5 = 10  
Respondent 77: 5 + 4 = 9  
Respondent 64: 2 + 2 = 4  
Respondent 78: 3 + 4 = 7  

2. **Group Respondents by 'Group' and Calculate Average Total Positive Usability Score for Each Group:**

- **Group A:** Respondents 86, 13, 59  
  - Respondent 86: 6  
  - Respondent 13: 10  
  - Respondent 59: 10  
  - Average for Group A: (6 + 10 + 10) / 3 = 26 / 3 = 8.67  
- **Group C:** Respondents 5, 37, 19  
  - Respondent 5: 10  
  - Respondent 37: 10  
  - Respondent 19: 8  
  - Average for Group C: (10 + 10 + 8) / 3 = 28 / 3 = 9.33  
- **Group D:** Respondents 90, 60, 48, 77, 64, 78  
  - Respondent 90: 10  
  - Respondent 60: 9  
  - Respondent 48: 10  
  - Respondent 77: 9  
  - Respondent 64: 4  
  - Respondent 78: 7  
  - Average for Group D: (10 + 9 + 10 + 9 + 4 + 7) / 6 = 49 / 6 = 8.17  

3. **Identify Respondents with a Score Lower than the Average of a Different Group:**

- For Group A (Average = 8.67), compare with averages of Group C (9.33) and Group D (8.17):  
  - Respondent 86 (Score = 6) is lower than both Group C and Group D averages.
- For Group C (Average = 9.33), compare with averages of Group A (8.67) and Group D (8.17):  
  - Respondent 19 (Score = 8) is lower than the average of Group D.
- For Group D (Average = 8.17), compare with averages of Group A (8.67) and Group C (9.33):  
  - Respondents 64 (Score = 4) and 78 (Score = 7) are lower than the averages of both Group A and Group C.  
  - Respondent 60 (Score = 9) is higher than the Group D average but lower than Group C's average, not applicable here since we compare to averages of other groups.  

Thus, the respondents who have a total positive usability score lower than the average for all respondents in a different group are:

- Respondent 86 (Group A, Score = 6, lower than Group C and Group D averages)
- Respondent 19 (Group C, Score = 8, lower than Group D average)
- Respondent 64 (Group D, Score = 4, lower than Group A and Group C averages)
- Respondent 78 (Group D, Score = 7, lower than Group A and Group C averages)

The final answer is: $\boxed{19, 64, 78, 86}$",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents whose 'Need_for_Technical_Support' is within 2 point of the highest 'Integration_of_Functions' for their group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to determine the highest 'Integration_of_Functions' score for each group and then identify respondents whose 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score is within 2 points of this highest score for their respective group.

From the 'responses' section, we can gather the necessary data:

1. **Group A**: Respondent 67 has an 'Integration_of_Functions' score of 5.
2. **Group B**: Respondent 23 has an 'Integration_of_Functions' score of 4.
3. **Group C**: Respondents 53 and 70 have an 'Integration_of_Functions' score of 5.
4. **Group D**: Respondents 15, 29, 49, and 90 have 'Integration_of_Functions' scores of 5.

The highest 'Integration_of_Functions' score for each group is:
- **Group A**: 5
- **Group B**: 4
- **Group C**: 5
- **Group D**: 5

Now, we look for respondents whose 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score is within 2 points of the highest 'Integration_of_Functions' score for their group:
- For **Group A**, the range is 3 to 7 (5 ± 2), but since 'Need_for_Technical_Support' is on a 1-5 scale, the effective range is 3 to 5. Respondent 67 has a 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score of 1, which is outside this range.
- For **Group B**, the range is 2 to 6 (4 ± 2), but since 'Need_for_Technical_Support' is on a 1-5 scale, the effective range is 2 to 5. Respondent 23 has a 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score of 3, which is within this range.
- For **Group C**, the range is 3 to 7 (5 ± 2), but since 'Need_for_Technical_Support' is on a 1-5 scale, the effective range is 3 to 5. Respondents 53 and 70 have 'Need_for_Technical_Support' scores of 1, which is outside this range.
- For **Group D**, the range is 3 to 7 (5 ± 2), but since 'Need_for_Technical_Support' is on a 1-5 scale, the effective range is 3 to 5. Respondent 90 has a 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score of 2, which is outside this range. Respondent 49 has a 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score of 4, which is within this range. Respondents 15 and 29 have 'Need_for_Technical_Support' scores of 1, which is outside this range.

Therefore, the respondents whose 'Need_for_Technical_Support' is within 2 points of the highest 'Integration_of_Functions' for their group are:

<task>
Which respondents have an 'Ease_of_Use' score that is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score for their group?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Ease_of_Use' score for each group and then compare each respondent's 'Ease_of_Use' score to the average of their respective group.

### Step 1: Calculate the average 'Ease_of_Use' score for each group.

- Group A: Respondents 35 and 11 have 'Ease_of_Use' scores of 1 and 5, respectively. Average = (1 + 5) / 2 = 3.
- Group B: Respondents 44 and 3 have 'Ease_of_Use' scores of 5 and 3, respectively. Average = (5 + 3) / 2 = 4.
- Group C: Respondents 54, 63, 33, 39, and 62 have 'Ease_of_Use' scores of 5, 5, 5, 1, and 5, respectively. Average = (5 + 5 + 5 + 1 + 5) / 5 = 4.2.
- Group D: Respondent 10 has an 'Ease_of_Use' score of 4. Average = 4 (since there's only one respondent in this group).

### Step 2: Identify respondents with 'Ease_of_Use' scores higher than their group's average.

- Group A: Respondent 11 has a score of 5, which is higher than the group average of 3.
- Group B: Respondent 44 has a score of 5, which is higher than the group average of 4.
- Group C: Respondents 54, 63, 33, and 62 all have scores of 5, which is higher than the group average of 4.2.
- Group D: Since the average is 4 and Respondent 10 has a score of 4, they are not higher than the average.

### Step 3: List the respondents who meet the criteria.

Respondents 11, 44, 54, 63, 33, and 62 have 'Ease_of_Use' scores higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score for their group.

The final answer is: $\boxed{11, 44, 54, 63, 33, 62}$",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents have a total positive usability score ('Ease_of_Use' + 'Integration_of_Functions') that is lower than the average for all respondents in a different group?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the total positive usability score for each respondent, which is the sum of 'Ease_of_Use' and 'Integration_of_Functions'. Then, we need to calculate the average of this score for each group. Finally, we compare each respondent's score with the average score of the other groups to find those who have a score lower than the average of a different group.

1. Calculate the total positive usability score for each respondent:
   - Respondent 10: 4 (Ease_of_Use) + 5 (Integration_of_Functions) = 9
   - Respondent 52: 4 + 4 = 8
   - Respondent 6: 4 + 5 = 9
   - Respondent 76: 5 + 4 = 9
   - Respondent 30: 5 + 5 = 10
   - Respondent 82: 4 + 4 = 8
   - Respondent 67: 5 + 5 = 10
   - Respondent 20: 5 + 4 = 9

2. Calculate the average total positive usability score for each group:
   - Group A: (4+4+5+5) / 4 = 18 / 4 = 4.5 (Respondents 52, 6, 76, 67)
   - Group D: (4+5) / 2 = 9 / 2 = 4.5 (Respondents 10, 30)
   - Group C: (4+5) / 2 = 9 / 2 = 4.5 (Respondents 82, 20)

However, the calculation above seems to misinterpret the instruction for calculating the group averages, as it doesn't correctly sum all relevant scores and then divide by the number of respondents in each group. Let's correct this and properly calculate the averages:

- Group A: Respondents 52, 6, 76, 67
  - Scores: 8 (52) + 9 (6) + 9 (76) + 10 (67) = 36
  - Average: 36 / 4 = 9
- Group D: Respondents 10, 30
  - Scores: 9 (10) + 10 (30) = 19
  - Average: 19 / 2 = 9.5
- Group C: Respondents 82, 20
  - Scores: 8 (82) + 9 (20) = 17
  - Average: 17 / 2 = 8.5

3. Compare each respondent's score with the average score of the other groups:
   - For Group A (average = 9), compare with averages of Group D (9.5) and Group C (8.5)
   - For Group D (average = 9.5), compare with averages of Group A (9) and Group C (8.5)
   - For Group C (average = 8.5), compare with averages of Group A (9) and Group D (9.5)

Respondents in Group A with scores lower than the average of Group D (9.5):
- Respondent 52 (score = 8)

Respondents in Group D with scores lower than the average of Group A (9) or Group C (8.5) is not applicable since their average is higher than Group A and higher than Group C, but we check for lower than Group A's average:
- None, since both scores are 9 or higher.

Respondents in Group C with scores lower than the average of Group A (9) or Group D (9.5):
- Respondent 82 (score = 8)

Thus, the respondents who have a total positive usability score lower than the average for all respondents in a different group are:
- Respondent 52
- Respondent 82

The final answer is: $\boxed{52, 82}$",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents have a total positive usability score ('Ease_of_Use' + 'Integration_of_Functions') that is lower than the average for all respondents in a different group?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the total positive usability score for each respondent, which is the sum of 'Ease_of_Use' and 'Integration_of_Functions'. Then, we calculate the average of this score for each group. Finally, we compare each respondent's score with the average score of the other groups to find those who have a score lower than the average of a different group.

### Step 1: Calculate Total Positive Usability Score for Each Respondent

| Respondent | Group | Ease_of_Use | Integration_of_Functions | Total Score |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 46 | A | 1 | 1 | 2 |
| 9 | C | 1 | 1 | 2 |
| 56 | A | 4 | 5 | 9 |
| 71 | D | 5 | 4 | 9 |
| 59 | A | 5 | 5 | 10 |
| 74 | D | 5 | 5 | 10 |
| 44 | B | 5 | 2 | 7 |
| 33 | C | 5 | 5 | 10 |
| 66 | B | 5 | 5 | 10 |
| 50 | C | 5 | 5 | 10 |
| 51 | C | 5 | 5 | 10 |
| 79 | B | 5 | 5 | 10 |

### Step 2: Calculate Average Total Positive Usability Score for Each Group

- Group A: (2 + 9 + 10 + 10) / 4 = 31 / 4 = 7.75
- Group B: (7 + 10 + 10 + 10) / 4 = 37 / 4 = 9.25
- Group C: (2 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10) / 5 = 42 / 5 = 8.4
- Group D: (9 + 10) / 2 = 19 / 2 = 9.5

### Step 3: Identify Respondents with a Score Lower Than the Average of a Different Group

- For Group A (avg = 7.75), compare with averages of other groups:
  - Respondent 46 (score = 2) is lower than the averages of Groups B, C, and D.
- For Group B (avg = 9.25), compare with averages of other groups:
  - Respondent 44 (score = 7) is lower than the averages of Groups C and D.
- For Group C (avg = 8.4), compare with averages of other groups:
  - Respondent 9 (score = 2) is lower than the averages of Groups A, B, and D.
- For Group D (avg = 9.5), compare with averages of other groups:
  - Respondent 71 (score = 9) is lower than the average of Group D, but since Group D's average is exactly 9.5, and there are no scores below 9 in Group D, we consider if it's lower than the average of another group. It's not lower than Group B's or D's average but is exactly at the threshold for being lower than D's average when considering a strict ""lower than"" criteria. However, it is lower than the average of Group B.

Thus, the respondents who have a total positive usability score lower than the average for all respondents in a different group are:

46, 9, 44, 71

These respondents meet the criteria based on the calculations and comparisons made.",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents have a total positive usability score ('Ease_of_Use' + 'Integration_of_Functions') that is lower than the average for all respondents in a different group?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the total positive usability score for each respondent, which is the sum of 'Ease_of_Use' and 'Integration_of_Functions'. Then, we calculate the average of this score for each group. Finally, we compare each respondent's score with the average score of the other groups to find those who have a score lower than the average of a different group.

1. Calculate the total positive usability score for each respondent:
   - Respondent 71: 5 (Ease_of_Use) + 4 (Integration_of_Functions) = 9
   - Respondent 41: 5 + 5 = 10
   - Respondent 17: 5 + 5 = 10
   - Respondent 72: 5 + 5 = 10
   - Respondent 69: 5 + 5 = 10
   - Respondent 39: 1 + 5 = 6
   - Respondent 65: 5 + 2 = 7
   - Respondent 25: 3 + 3 = 6

2. Calculate the average total positive usability score for each group:
   - Group A (Respondents 72, 65): (10 + 7) / 2 = 17 / 2 = 8.5
   - Group B (Respondent 69): 10 (since there's only one respondent, the average is the score itself)
   - Group C (Respondents 17, 39): (10 + 6) / 2 = 16 / 2 = 8
   - Group D (Respondents 71, 41, 25): (9 + 10 + 6) / 3 = 25 / 3 ≈ 8.33

3. Compare each respondent's score with the average score of the other groups:
   - For Group A (average = 8.5):
     - Respondent 72 (score = 10) is not lower than any other group's average.
     - Respondent 65 (score = 7) is lower than Group B's average (10), Group C's average (8), and Group D's average (8.33).
   - For Group B (average = 10):
     - Respondent 69 (score = 10) is not lower than any other group's average.
   - For Group C (average = 8):
     - Respondent 17 (score = 10) is not lower than any other group's average.
     - Respondent 39 (score = 6) is lower than Group A's average (8.5), Group B's average (10), and Group D's average (8.33).
   - For Group D (average = 8.33):
     - Respondent 71 (score = 9) is lower than Group B's average (10) but not lower than Group A's or Group C's averages.
     - Respondent 41 (score = 10) is not lower than any other group's average.
     - Respondent 25 (score = 6) is lower than Group A's average (8.5), Group B's average (10), and Group C's average (8).

Respondents with a total positive usability score lower than the average for all respondents in a different group are:

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents whose 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' is within 2 point of the highest 'Integration_of_Functions' for their group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to determine the highest 'Integration_of_Functions' score for each group and then identify the respondents whose 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score is within 2 points of this highest score for their respective groups.

1. **Identify the highest 'Integration_of_Functions' score for each group:**

   - Group A: Respondent 42 and Respondent 6 both have the highest 'Integration_of_Functions' score of 5.
   - Group B: Respondent 66 and Respondent 36 both have the highest 'Integration_of_Functions' score of 5.
   - Group C: Respondent 53 has the highest 'Integration_of_Functions' score of 5.
   - Group D: Respondent 45, Respondent 15, Respondent 71, and Respondent 7 all have high 'Integration_of_Functions' scores, with Respondent 45 and Respondent 15 having a score of 5, which is the highest.

2. **Determine the range of 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' scores that are within 2 points of the highest 'Integration_of_Functions' score for each group:**

   Since the highest 'Integration_of_Functions' score across all groups is 5, the range of 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' scores we are interested in is 3 to 5 (5 - 2 = 3 and 5 + 2 = 7, but since the maximum score is 5, the upper limit remains 5).

3. **List respondents whose 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' is within this range for their group:**

   - Group A: Respondent 42 ('Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 3) and Respondent 6 ('Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 1) - Only Respondent 42 fits the criteria.
   - Group B: Respondent 66 ('Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 2) and Respondent 36 ('Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 1) - Neither fits the criteria.
   - Group C: Respondent 53 ('Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 1) - Does not fit the criteria. Respondent 88 ('Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 1) and Respondent 9 ('Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 4) - Only Respondent 9 fits the criteria.
   - Group D: Respondent 45 ('Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 1), Respondent 15 ('Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 2), Respondent 71 ('Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 1), Respondent 7 ('Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 1) - None of these fit the criteria directly based on the initial assessment, but reviewing the criteria, Respondent 15 is close but does not exactly fit the defined range of interest based on the initial misinterpretation. However, considering the correct interpretation of the task, we should focus on those whose 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' is within 2 points of their group's highest 'Integration_of_Functions', which means looking for scores 3 to 5. Thus, Respondent 15 with a score of 2 is just below this range.

Given the detailed analysis, the respondents whose 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' is within 2 points of the highest 'Integration_of_Functions' for their group are:

- Respondent 42
- Respondent 9
