<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents from the 'Junior' group whose 'Confidence_in_Use' is exactly 4.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify respondents from the 'Junior' group.
2. Filter those respondents to only include those whose 'Confidence_in_Use' score is exactly 4.

From the provided data:

- The 'Junior' group corresponds to option B in the 'Group' question.
- We need to find respondents with 'Group' as B and 'Confidence_in_Use' as 4.

Let's examine the responses:

### Respondent 31
- **Group:** D
- **Confidence_in_Use:** 1

### Respondent 76
- **Group:** A
- **Confidence_in_Use:** 5

### Respondent 70
- **Group:** C
- **Confidence_in_Use:** 5

### Respondent 17
- **Group:** C
- **Confidence_in_Use:** 5

### Respondent 48
- **Group:** D
- **Confidence_in_Use:** 5

### Respondent 78

- **Confidence_in_Use:** 2

### Respondent 61
- **Group:** B
- **Confidence_in_Use:** 1

### Respondent 81
- **Group:** A
- **Confidence_in_Use:** 4

From the given data, only Respondent 81 matches the 'Group' as not being 'Junior' (since they are 'A', which corresponds to 'Senior'), but their 'Confidence_in_Use' is indeed 4. However, we are looking for respondents from the 'Junior' group, which corresponds to option B.

The only respondent from the 'Junior' group is Respondent 61, but their 'Confidence_in_Use' score is 1, not 4.

Therefore, based on the provided data, there are no respondents from the 'Junior' group whose 'Confidence_in_Use' is exactly 4.",False

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents from the 'Senior' group whose 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' is exactly 1.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to identify respondents who belong to the 'Senior' group and have a 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score of exactly 1.

From the provided data:

- Respondent 42 is from group A (which corresponds to 'Senior' based on the schema), and their 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score is 3, not 1.
- Respondent 51 is from group C (which corresponds to 'Middle'), so they do not fit the 'Senior' group criteria.
- Respondent 84 is from group D (which corresponds to 'Intern'), so they also do not fit the 'Senior' group criteria.
- Respondent 7 is from group D (which corresponds to 'Intern'), so they do not fit the 'Senior' group criteria.
- Respondent 20 is from group C (which corresponds to 'Middle'), so they do not fit the 'Senior' group criteria.

However, upon reviewing the task again, it seems there might have been an oversight in the initial analysis regarding the direct mapping of group codes to their respective names and the specific condition for 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use'. Given the data and the task:

The only respondent from the 'Senior' group (A) mentioned is Respondent 42, but their 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score is 3, not 1. Thus, based on the provided data, there are no respondents from the 'Senior' group with a 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score of exactly 1.

Therefore, the list of respondents who fit the criteria is empty.",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
List all respondents from the 'Middle' group whose 'Need_for_Technical_Support' is exactly 4.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to follow the instructions carefully and analyze the provided data.


First, we need to identify the respondents from the 'Middle' group. According to the schema, 'Middle' corresponds to option C in the 'Group' field.


Next, we need to find the respondents whose 'Need_for_Technical_Support' is exactly 4. This means we are looking for responses where the 'Need_for_Technical_Support' field has a value of 4.


Now, let's examine the responses:


### Respondent 74
- **Group:** D
- **Need_for_Technical_Support:** 1


### Respondent 5
- **Group:** C
- **Need_for_Technical_Support:** 1


### Respondent 55
- **Group:** A
- **Need_for_Technical_Support:** 1


### Respondent 62
- **Group:** C
- **Need_for_Technical_Support:** 1


### Respondent 2
- **Group:** C
- **Need_for_Technical_Support:** 1


None of the respondents in the 'Middle' group (C) have a 'Need_for_Technical_Support' value of exactly 4. In fact, none of the respondents have a 'Need_for_Technical_Support' value of 4 at all.


The final answer is: $\boxed{None}$",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'System_Complexity' score is between 1 and 3.
</task>","To find all respondents whose 'System_Complexity' score is between 1 and 3, we need to look at each respondent's answer for 'System_Complexity' and identify those that fall within this range.

From the provided data:

- Respondent 87: **System_Complexity** = 2 (within range)
- Respondent 6: **System_Complexity** = 1 (within range)
- Respondent 67: **System_Complexity** = 1 (within range)
- Respondent 16: **System_Complexity** = 1 (within range)
- Respondent 66: **System_Complexity** = 1 (within range)
- Respondent 26: **System_Complexity** = 2 (within range)

- Respondent 38: **System_Complexity** = 1 (within range)
- Respondent 75: **System_Complexity** = 1 (within range)

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents from the 'Senior' group whose 'Need_for_Technical_Support' is exactly 1.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to identify respondents from the 'Senior' group (which corresponds to option A in the 'Group' question) and then filter those whose 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score is exactly 1.

From the provided responses:

- Respondent 38 is in group A ('Senior') and has a 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score of 3.
- Respondent 11 is in group A ('Senior') and has a 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score of 5.
- Respondent 76 is in group A ('Senior') and has a 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score of 1.
- Respondent 55 is in group A ('Senior') and has a 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score of 1.
- Respondent 46 is in group A ('Senior') and has a 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score of 2.

Thus, the respondents from the 'Senior' group with a 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score of exactly 1 are Respondent 76 and Respondent 55.

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents from the 'Junior' group have a 'System_Complexity' of 4 or more and a 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' of less than 4?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to identify respondents from the 'Junior' group who have a 'System_Complexity' score of 4 or more and a 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score of less than 4.


From the provided data, we can see that:


- Respondent 15 is from group D (Intern), not Junior.
- Respondent 17 is from group C (Middle), not Junior.
- Respondent 70 is from group C (Middle), not Junior.
- Respondent 77 is from group D (Intern), not Junior.
- Respondent 23 is from group B (Junior). Their 'System_Complexity' score is 1, which is less than 4, so they do not meet the 'System_Complexity' criterion.
- Respondent 29 is from group D (Intern), not Junior.
- Respondent 82 is from group C (Middle), not Junior.
- Respondent 60 is from group D (Intern), not Junior.


Since none of the respondents from the 'Junior' group have a 'System_Complexity' of 4 or more and a 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' of less than 4, the answer is:


There are no respondents that meet the specified criteria.",False

<task>
Which respondents from the 'Middle' group have a 'Cumbersome_to_Use' of 4 or more and a 'Ease_of_Use' of less than 3?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to analyze the 'responses' section of the data and identify respondents from the 'Middle' group who meet the specified conditions.


## Step 1: Identify respondents from the 'Middle' group
The 'Middle' group corresponds to the option ""C"" in the 'Group' field. We will look for respondents with 'Group' equal to ""C"".


## Step 2: Filter respondents with 'Cumbersome_to_Use' of 4 or more
We need to find respondents who have a 'Cumbersome_to_Use' score of 4 or more.


## Step 3: Filter respondents with 'Ease_of_Use' of less than 3
We also need to find respondents who have an 'Ease_of_Use' score of less than 3.


## Step 4: Analyze each respondent's data
Let's analyze each respondent's data:


- Respondent 37: 'Group' is ""C"", 'Cumbersome_to_Use' is 1, and 'Ease_of_Use' is 5. This respondent does not meet the conditions.
- Respondent 51: 'Group' is ""C"", 'Cumbersome_to_Use' is 1, and 'Ease_of_Use' is 5. This respondent does not meet the conditions.
- Respondent 54: 'Group' is ""C"", 'Cumbersome_to_Use' is 1, and 'Ease_of_Use' is 5. This respondent does not meet the conditions.


None of the respondents from the 'Middle' group meet the specified conditions.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents whose 'System_Complexity' score is greater than their 'Ease_of_Use' score.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to compare the 'System_Complexity' score with the 'Ease_of_Use' score for each respondent and list those where 'System_Complexity' is greater.

Let's examine the responses:

### Respondent 2
- **System_Complexity:** 1
- **Ease_of_Use:** 4
Since 1 is not greater than 4, Respondent 2 does not meet the criteria.

### Respondent 61
- **System_Complexity:** 5
- **Ease_of_Use:** 2
Since 5 is greater than 2, Respondent 61 meets the criteria.

### Respondent 15
- **System_Complexity:** 2
- **Ease_of_Use:** 4
Since 2 is not greater than 4, Respondent 15 does not meet the criteria.

### Respondent 51
- **System_Complexity:** 1
- **Ease_of_Use:** 5
Since 1 is not greater than 5, Respondent 51 does not meet the criteria.

### Respondent 19
- **System_Complexity:** 1
- **Ease_of_Use:** 5
Since 1 is not greater than 5, Respondent 19 does not meet the criteria.

### Respondent 88
- **System_Complexity:** 2
- **Ease_of_Use:** 5
Since 2 is not greater than 5, Respondent 88 does not meet the criteria.

### Respondent 6
- **System_Complexity:** 1
- **Ease_of_Use:** 4
Since 1 is not greater than 4, Respondent 6 does not meet the criteria.

### Respondent 18
- **System_Complexity:** 1

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose total score for 'Inconsistency' and 'Confidence_in_Use' is less than 6.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to calculate the total score for 'Inconsistency' and 'Confidence_in_Use' for each respondent and then identify those whose total score is less than 6.


## Step 1: Calculate total score for each respondent
We will go through each respondent's data and add their 'Inconsistency' and 'Confidence_in_Use' scores.


## Step 2: Identify respondents with total score less than 6
After calculating the total scores, we will identify the respondents whose scores are less than 6.


Respondent 68: Inconsistency (2) + Confidence_in_Use (4) = 6
Respondent 46: Inconsistency (2) + Confidence_in_Use (3) = 5
Respondent 75: Inconsistency (4) + Confidence_in_Use (4) = 8
Respondent 4: Inconsistency (1) + Confidence_in_Use (5) = 6
Respondent 30: Inconsistency (1) + Confidence_in_Use (5) = 6
Respondent 50: Inconsistency (2) + Confidence_in_Use (4) = 6
Respondent 47: Inconsistency (1) + Confidence_in_Use (5) = 6
Respondent 9: Inconsistency (5) + Confidence_in_Use (2) = 7
Respondent 55: Inconsistency (1) + Confidence_in_Use (2) = 3
Respondent 40: Inconsistency (1) + Confidence_in_Use (5) = 6
Respondent 44: Inconsistency (1) + Confidence_in_Use (1) = 2
Respondent 13: Inconsistency (1) + Confidence_in_Use (5) = 6


## Step 3: List respondents with total score less than 6
Based on the calculations, the respondents with a total score less than 6 are:
- Respondent 46: 5
- Respondent 55: 3
- Respondent 44: 2


The final answer is: $\boxed{46, 55, 44}$",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents whose 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score is greater than their 'Confidence_in_Use' score.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to compare the 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score with the 'Confidence_in_Use' score for each respondent and list those where 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' is greater.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose total score for 'Inconsistency' and 'Frequent_Usage' is less than 4.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondents from the 'Senior' group have a 'Confidence_in_Use' of 3 or more and a 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' of less than 4?
</task>","To solve this task, we need to identify respondents from the 'Senior' group who have a 'Confidence_in_Use' score of 3 or more and a 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score of less than 4.

From the provided data, we can see that the 'Senior' group corresponds to option A.

Let's examine each respondent's data:

### Respondent 55
- **Group:** A (Senior)
- **Confidence_in_Use:** 2 (less than 3, so not included)
- **Need_to_Learn_Before_Use:** 4 (not less than 4, so not included)

### Respondent 6
- **Group:** A (Senior)
- **Confidence_in_Use:** 5 (3 or more, so included)
- **Need_to_Learn_Before_Use:** 1 (less than 4, so included)

No other respondents are from the 'Senior' group. Therefore, the only respondent that meets the criteria is Respondent 6.

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".

Find all respondents whose total score for 'Cumbersome_to_Use' and 'Integration_of_Functions' is less than 6.
</task>","To find all respondents whose total score for 'Cumbersome_to_Use' and 'Integration_of_Functions' is less than 6, we need to calculate the sum of these two scores for each respondent and then identify those with a total score less than 6.


## Step 1: Calculate the total score for 'Cumbersome_to_Use' and 'Integration_of_Functions' for each respondent.
- Respondent 27: Cumbersome_to_Use = 5, Integration_of_Functions = 2, Total = 7
- Respondent 34: Cumbersome_to_Use = 1, Integration_of_Functions = 4, Total = 5
- Respondent 50: Cumbersome_to_Use = 2, Integration_of_Functions = 5, Total = 7
- Respondent 4: Cumbersome_to_Use = 1, Integration_of_Functions = 3, Total = 4
- Respondent 25: Cumbersome_to_Use = 3, Integration_of_Functions = 3, Total = 6
- Respondent 29: Cumbersome_to_Use = 1, Integration_of_Functions = 4, Total = 5
- Respondent 51: Cumbersome_to_Use = 1, Integration_of_Functions = 5, Total = 6
- Respondent 73: Cumbersome_to_Use = 1, Integration_of_Functions = 4, Total = 5
- Respondent 1: Cumbersome_to_Use = 1, Integration_of_Functions = 5, Total = 6


## Step 2: Identify respondents with a total score less than 6.
From the calculations:
- Respondent 4 has a total score of 4.
- Respondent 34 has a total score of 5.
- Respondent 29 has a total score of 5.
- Respondent 73 has a total score of 5.
These respondents have a total score less than 6.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'Ease_of_Learning' is greater than the average 'Ease_of_Learning' for their group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Ease_of_Learning' for each group and then identify the respondents whose 'Ease_of_Learning' score exceeds this average for their respective groups.

### Step 1: Calculate Average 'Ease_of_Learning' for Each Group

We will calculate the average 'Ease_of_Learning' for each group (A, B, C, D) based on the provided responses.

- **Group A**: Respondent 89 has an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 5. Since there's only one respondent in Group A, the average is 5.
- **Group B**: Respondent 36 has an 'Ease_of_Learning' score of 5. With only one respondent in Group B, the average is 5.
- **Group C**: Respondents 43, 22, 50, and 37 have 'Ease_of_Learning' scores of 3, 4, 4, and 5, respectively. The average is (3 + 4 + 4 + 5) / 4 = 16 / 4 = 4.
- **Group D**: Respondents 49, 30, 74, and 71 have 'Ease_of_Learning' scores of 4, 5, 5, and 5, respectively. The average is (4 + 5 + 5 + 5) / 4 = 19 / 4 = 4.75.

### Step 2: Identify Respondents with 'Ease_of_Learning' Greater Than the Group Average

Now, we compare each respondent's 'Ease_of_Learning' score to the average of their group to find those who scored higher.

- **Group A**: Since the average is 5, and Respondent 89 also scored 5, there are no respondents above the average.
- **Group B**: The average is 5, and Respondent 36 scored 5, so there are no respondents above the average.
- **Group C**: The average is 4. Respondents 43 (score 3), 22 (score 4), and 50 (score 4) are below or at the average. Only Respondent 37 (score 5) is above the average.
- **Group D**: The average is 4.75. Respondent 49 (score 4) is below the average. Respondents 30, 74, and 71 (scores 5, 5, and 5) are above the average.

### Respondents Above the Average 'Ease_of_Learning' for Their Group

Based on the analysis, the respondents whose 'Ease_of_Learning' score is greater than the average for their group are:

- Respondent 37 (Group C)
- Respondents 30, 74, and 71 (Group D)

Therefore, the list of respondent IDs whose 'Ease_of_Learning' is greater than the average 'Ease_of_Learning' for their group is: 37, 30, 74, 71.",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents have an 'Ease_of_Use' score that is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score for their group?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Ease_of_Use' score for each group and then compare each respondent's 'Ease_of_Use' score to the average of their respective group.

### Step 1: Calculate the average 'Ease_of_Use' score for each group.

- Group A: No respondents.
- Group B: Respondents 36, 32, 14, and 12 have scores 5, 5, 4, and 5 respectively.
  - Average for Group B = (5 + 5 + 4 + 5) / 4 = 19 / 4 = 4.75
- Group C: Respondents 82, 4, 87, and 70 have scores 4, 5, 3, and 5 respectively.
  - Average for Group C = (4 + 5 + 3 + 5) / 4 = 17 / 4 = 4.25
- Group D: Respondents 15, 29, 18, and 12 have scores 4, 4, 4, and 5 respectively.
  - Average for Group D = (4 + 4 + 4 + 5) / 4 = 17 / 4 = 4.25

### Step 2: Identify respondents with 'Ease_of_Use' scores higher than their group's average.

- Group B: All respondents (36, 32, 14, 12) have scores higher than or equal to the group average. Only those strictly higher than the average should be considered, but since the average is 4.75, respondents with a score of 5 are equal to or higher than the average, but there's no one with a score lower than 4.75 in this group. Thus, all are considered in the context of being at or above average, but for strictness, we note scores of 5 are exactly at or above this high average.
- Group C: Respondents with scores higher than 4.25 are 4 and 70 (both scored 5).
- Group D: Respondent 12 has a score of 5, which is higher than 4.25.

### Step 3: List the respondents who meet the criteria.

Based on the calculations, the respondents with 'Ease_of_Use' scores higher than the average for their group are:

- From Group B, considering the instruction to follow the format to the letter and focusing on those ""higher"" than the average in a strict sense is challenging since all scores are at or above the average. However, the task seems to aim at identifying those who exceed the group average, which in Group B's case, given the high average, means looking for scores above 4.75, but all are 4.75 or above, so technically, 36, 32, and 12 (if we consider 12 as part of B, but the data shows 12 as part of D) are at this threshold.
- From Group C: 4 and 70.
- From Group D: 12.

Given the strict interpretation and the format requirement, focusing on those strictly above their group's average, and considering the potential misinterpretation of Group B's average being so high that all members meet or exceed it, the list should technically include those who are above their group's average, but given the data and averages calculated:

The final answer is: 4, 70, 12",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondents have a total positive usability score ('Ease_of_Use' + 'Integration_of_Functions') that is lower than the average for all respondents in a different group?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the total positive usability score for each respondent, which is the sum of 'Ease_of_Use' and 'Integration_of_Functions'. Then, we calculate the average of this score for each group. Finally, we compare each respondent's score with the average score of the other groups to find those whose score is lower than the average of a different group.

### Step 1: Calculate Total Positive Usability Score for Each Respondent

- Respondent 5: 5 (Ease_of_Use) + 5 (Integration_of_Functions) = 10
- Respondent 37: 5 + 5 = 10
- Respondent 90: 5 + 5 = 10
- Respondent 19: 5 + 3 = 8
- Respondent 60: 5 + 4 = 9
- Respondent 48: 5 + 5 = 10
- Respondent 86: 1 + 5 = 6
- Respondent 13: 5 + 5 = 10
- Respondent 59: 5 + 5 = 10
- Respondent 77: 5 + 4 = 9
- Respondent 64: 2 + 2 = 4
- Respondent 78: 3 + 4 = 7

### Step 2: Calculate Average Total Positive Usability Score for Each Group

- Group A: (6 + 10 + 10) / 3 = 26 / 3 = 8.67
- Group C: (10 + 10 + 8) / 3 = 28 / 3 = 9.33
- Group D: (10 + 9 + 10 + 9 + 4 + 7) / 6 = 49 / 6 = 8.17

### Step 3: Identify Respondents with Score Lower than Average of Another Group

- For Group A (Average = 8.67):
  - Respondent 86 (Score = 6) is lower than Group C's average (9.33) and Group D's average (8.17).
- For Group C (Average = 9.33):
  - Respondent 19 (Score = 8) is lower than Group C's own average, but we are comparing to other groups. It is lower than none since both other groups have lower averages.
- For Group D (Average = 8.17):
  - Respondents 64 (Score = 4) and 78 (Score = 7) are lower than Group A's average (8.67) and Group C's average (9.33).
  - Respondent 60 (Score = 9) is higher than Group A's average but lower than Group C's average.
  - Respondent 77 (Score = 9) is higher than Group A's average but lower than Group C's average.

Thus, the respondents who have a total positive usability score lower than the average for all respondents in a different group are:

- Respondent 86 (lower than Group C and Group D averages)
- Respondent 64 (lower than Group A and Group C averages)
- Respondent 78 (lower than Group A and Group C averages)
- Respondent 60 (lower than Group C average)
- Respondent 77 (lower than Group C average)

The final answer is: $\boxed{86, 64, 78, 60, 77}$",False

<task>
List all respondents whose 'Need_for_Technical_Support' is within 2 point of the highest 'Integration_of_Functions' for their group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to understand the 'questions' section to interpret the data correctly. The 'Need_for_Technical_Support' and 'Integration_of_Functions' are both measured on a Likert scale of 1-5.

Next, we analyze the 'responses' to find the highest 'Integration_of_Functions' score for each group and then identify respondents whose 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score is within 2 points of this highest score.

## Step 1: Identify the Highest 'Integration_of_Functions' Score for Each Group
- Group A: Respondent 67 has an 'Integration_of_Functions' score of 5.
- Group B: Respondent 23 has an 'Integration_of_Functions' score of 4.
- Group C: Respondents 53 and 70 have an 'Integration_of_Functions' score of 5.
- Group D: Respondents 15, 49, and 90 have an 'Integration_of_Functions' score of 5.

## Step 2: Determine the Range for 'Need_for_Technical_Support' for Each Group
- For Group A, the range is 3-5 (since 5 - 2 = 3 and 5 + 2 = 7, but the maximum score is 5).
- For Group B, the range is 2-4 (since 4 - 2 = 2 and 4 + 2 = 6, but the maximum score is 5).
- For Group C, the range is 3-5.
- For Group D, the range is 3-5.

## Step 3: Identify Respondents Whose 'Need_for_Technical_Support' Falls Within the Determined Range for Their Group
- Group A: Respondent 67 has a 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score of 1, which does not fall within the range.
- Group B: Respondent 23 has a 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score of 3, which falls within the range.
- Group C: Respondents 53 and 70 have 'Need_for_Technical_Support' scores of 1, which do not fall within the range.
- Group D: Respondent 15 has a 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score of 1, Respondent 49 has a score of 4, and Respondent 90 has a score of 2. Only Respondent 49's score falls within the range.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents have an 'Ease_of_Use' score that is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score for their group?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Ease_of_Use' score for each group and then compare each respondent's 'Ease_of_Use' score to the average of their respective group.

### Step 1: Calculate the average 'Ease_of_Use' score for each group.

- Group A: Respondents 35 and 11.
  - Respondent 35: Ease_of_Use = 1
  - Respondent 11: Ease_of_Use = 5
  - Average for Group A = (1 + 5) / 2 = 3

- Group B: Respondents 44 and 3.
  - Respondent 44: Ease_of_Use = 5
  - Respondent 3: Ease_of_Use = 3
  - Average for Group B = (5 + 3) / 2 = 4

- Group C: Respondents 54, 63, 33, 39, and 62.
  - Respondent 54: Ease_of_Use = 5
  - Respondent 63: Ease_of_Use = 5
  - Respondent 33: Ease_of_Use = 5
  - Respondent 39: Ease_of_Use = 1
  - Respondent 62: Ease_of_Use = 5
  - Average for Group C = (5 + 5 + 5 + 1 + 5) / 5 = 4.2

- Group D: Respondent 10.
  - Respondent 10: Ease_of_Use = 4
  - Average for Group D = 4 (since there's only one respondent)

### Step 2: Compare each respondent's 'Ease_of_Use' score to the average of their group.

- Group A:
  - Respondent 35: 1 < 3 (average), so not higher.
  - Respondent 11: 5 > 3 (average), so higher.

- Group B:
  - Respondent 44: 5 > 4 (average), so higher.
  - Respondent 3: 3 < 4 (average), so not higher.

- Group C:
  - Respondent 54: 5 > 4.2 (average), so higher.
  - Respondent 63: 5 > 4.2 (average), so higher.
  - Respondent 33: 5 > 4.2 (average), so higher.
  - Respondent 39: 1 < 4.2 (average), so not higher.
  - Respondent 62: 5 > 4.2 (average), so higher.

- Group D:
  - Respondent 10: 4 = 4 (average), so not higher (since the question asks for higher than the average).

### Step 3: List the respondents who have an 'Ease_of_Use' score higher than the average for their group.

Respondents with higher 'Ease_of_Use' scores than their group's average are: 11, 44, 54, 63, 33, 62.

The final answer is: $\boxed{11, 44, 54, 63, 33, 62}$",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents have a total positive usability score ('Ease_of_Use' + 'Integration_of_Functions') that is lower than the average for all respondents in a different group?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the total positive usability score for each respondent, which is the sum of 'Ease_of_Use' and 'Integration_of_Functions'. Then, we calculate the average of this score for each group. Finally, we compare each respondent's score with the average score of the other groups to find those who have a lower score than the average of a different group.

### Step 1: Calculate Total Positive Usability Score for Each Respondent

- Respondent 10: 4 (Ease_of_Use) + 5 (Integration_of_Functions) = 9
- Respondent 52: 4 + 4 = 8
- Respondent 6: 4 + 5 = 9
- Respondent 76: 5 + 4 = 9
- Respondent 30: 5 + 5 = 10
- Respondent 82: 4 + 4 = 8
- Respondent 67: 5 + 5 = 10
- Respondent 20: 5 + 4 = 9

### Step 2: Calculate Average Total Positive Usability Score for Each Group

- Group A: (4+4+5+5) / 4 = 18 / 4 = 4.5 (Respondents 52, 6, 76, 67)
- Group D: (4+5) / 2 = 9 / 2 = 4.5 (Respondents 10, 30)
- Group C: (4+5) / 2 = 9 / 2 = 4.5 (Respondents 82, 20)

Corrected calculation considering the actual scores:
- Group A: (8+9+9+10) / 4 = 36 / 4 = 9
- Group D: (9+10) / 2 = 19 / 2 = 9.5
- Group C: (8+9) / 2 = 17 / 2 = 8.5

### Step 3: Identify Respondents with a Score Lower Than the Average of a Different Group

- For Group A (Average = 9), compare with Group D (9.5) and Group C (8.5):
  - Respondent 52 (Score = 8) is lower than Group D's average.
- For Group D (Average = 9.5), compare with Group A (9) and Group C (8.5):
  - No respondents in Group D have a score lower than the average of Group C.
- For Group C (Average = 8.5), compare with Group A (9) and Group D (9.5):
  - Respondent 82 (Score = 8) is lower than Group A's and Group D's averages.

Thus, the respondents who have a total positive usability score lower than the average for all respondents in a different group are Respondent 52 and Respondent 82.

The final answer is: $\boxed{52, 82}$",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents have a total positive usability score ('Ease_of_Use' + 'Integration_of_Functions') that is lower than the average for all respondents in a different group?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the total positive usability score for each respondent, which is the sum of 'Ease_of_Use' and 'Integration_of_Functions'. Then, we calculate the average of this score for each group. Finally, we compare each respondent's score with the average score of the other groups to find those who have a lower score than the average of a different group.

### Step 1: Calculate Total Positive Usability Score for Each Respondent

- Respondent 46: 1 (Ease_of_Use) + 1 (Integration_of_Functions) = 2
- Respondent 9: 1 + 1 = 2
- Respondent 56: 4 + 5 = 9
- Respondent 71: 5 + 4 = 9
- Respondent 59: 5 + 5 = 10
- Respondent 74: 5 + 5 = 10
- Respondent 44: 5 + 2 = 7
- Respondent 33: 5 + 5 = 10
- Respondent 66: 5 + 5 = 10
- Respondent 50: 5 + 5 = 10
- Respondent 51: 5 + 5 = 10
- Respondent 79: 5 + 5 = 10

### Step 2: Calculate Average Total Positive Usability Score for Each Group

- Group A: (2 + 9 + 10 + 10) / 4 = 31 / 4 = 7.75
- Group B: (7 + 10 + 10) / 3 = 27 / 3 = 9
- Group C: (2 + 10 + 10 + 10) / 4 = 32 / 4 = 8
- Group D: (9 + 10) / 2 = 19 / 2 = 9.5

### Step 3: Identify Respondents with a Score Lower Than the Average of a Different Group

- For Group A (Average = 7.75):
  - Respondent 46 (Score = 2) is lower than Group B, C, and D averages.
  - Respondent 56 (Score = 9) is lower than Group D average.
  - Respondent 59 (Score = 10) is not lower than any group's average.
  - Respondent 74 is not in Group A, mistake in calculation.

- For Group B (Average = 9):
  - Respondent 44 (Score = 7) is lower than Group C and D averages.
  - Respondent 66 (Score = 10) is not lower than any group's average.
  - Respondent 79 (Score = 10) is not lower than any group's average.

- For Group C (Average = 8):
  - Respondent 9 (Score = 2) is lower than Group A, B, and D averages.
  - Respondent 33 (Score = 10) is not lower than any group's average.
  - Respondent 50 (Score = 10) is not lower than any group's average.
  - Respondent 51 (Score = 10) is not lower than any group's average.

- For Group D (Average = 9.5):
  - Respondent 71 (Score = 9) is lower than Group D's own average, which doesn't apply since we're comparing to other groups, but it's lower than no other group's average since it's the highest average.
  - Respondent 74 (Score = 10) is not lower than any group's average.

### Respondents with a Total Positive Usability Score Lower Than the Average of a Different Group

- Respondent 46
- Respondent 9
- Respondent 44
- Respondent 56 

Note: The calculation for Respondent 74 was mistakenly included in Group A's calculation, which is incorrect as Respondent 74 belongs to Group D. The correct assessment for Respondent 74 should be as part of Group D, where the comparison is not applicable in the same manner due to the nature of the question asking for scores lower than the average of a ""different"" group. 

Given the task's specifics and correcting for the oversight, the final list of respondents who meet the criteria based on the calculated averages and comparisons should be directly identified by their IDs without further misattribution. 

The final answer is: $\boxed{46, 9, 44}$",False

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondents have a total positive usability score ('Ease_of_Use' + 'Integration_of_Functions') that is lower than the average for all respondents in a different group?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the total positive usability score for each respondent, which is the sum of 'Ease_of_Use' and 'Integration_of_Functions'. Then, we calculate the average of this score for each group. Finally, we compare each respondent's score with the average score of the other groups to find those who have a score lower than the average of a different group.

### Step 1: Calculate Total Positive Usability Score for Each Respondent

- Respondent 71: 5 (Ease_of_Use) + 4 (Integration_of_Functions) = 9
- Respondent 41: 5 + 5 = 10
- Respondent 17: 5 + 5 = 10
- Respondent 72: 5 + 5 = 10
- Respondent 69: 5 + 5 = 10
- Respondent 39: 1 + 5 = 6
- Respondent 65: 5 + 2 = 7
- Respondent 25: 3 + 3 = 6

### Step 2: Calculate Average Total Positive Usability Score for Each Group

- Group A (Respondents 72, 65): (10 + 7) / 2 = 17 / 2 = 8.5
- Group B (Respondent 69): 10
- Group C (Respondents 17, 39): (10 + 6) / 2 = 16 / 2 = 8
- Group D (Respondents 71, 41, 25): (9 + 10 + 6) / 3 = 25 / 3 ≈ 8.33

### Step 3: Identify Respondents with a Score Lower Than the Average of a Different Group

- For Group A (Average = 8.5):
  - Respondent 65 (Score = 7) has a score lower than the average of Group B (10), Group C (8), and Group D (8.33).
- For Group B (Average = 10):
  - No respondents in other groups have a higher average, so we look for scores lower than 10 in Group B itself, but there's only one respondent.
- For Group C (Average = 8):
  - Respondent 39 (Score = 6) has a score lower than the average of Group A (8.5), Group B (10), and Group D (8.33).
- For Group D (Average = 8.33):
  - Respondent 25 (Score = 6) and Respondent 71 (Score = 9) do not have scores lower than the average of Group B (10), but Respondent 25 has a score lower than the averages of Group A (8.5) and Group B (10).

### Respondents with a Total Positive Usability Score Lower Than the Average for All Respondents in a Different Group

Based on the calculations, the respondents who meet the criteria are:

- Respondent 65
- Respondent 39
- Respondent 25

These respondents have a total positive usability score that is lower than the average for all respondents in at least one different group.",False

</output>

<task>
List all respondents whose 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' is within 2 point of the highest 'Integration_of_Functions' for their group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to find the highest 'Integration_of_Functions' score for each group, and then identify respondents whose 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score is within 2 points of this highest score for their respective group.

### Step 1: Identify the Highest 'Integration_of_Functions' Score for Each Group

- **Group A:** The highest 'Integration_of_Functions' score is 5 (Respondents 42 and 6).
- **Group B:** The highest 'Integration_of_Functions' score is 5 (Respondents 66 and 36).
- **Group C:** The highest 'Integration_of_Functions' score is 4 (Respondent 88).
- **Group D:** The highest 'Integration_of_Functions' score is 5 (Respondents 45, 15, 71, and 7).

### Step 2: Determine the Range for 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' for Each Group

- **Group A:** The range is 5 - 2 = 3 to 5 + 2 = 7. However, since the 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score cannot exceed 5, the effective range is 3 to 5.
- **Group B:** The range is 5 - 2 = 3 to 5 + 2 = 7. However, since the 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score cannot exceed 5, the effective range is 3 to 5.
- **Group C:** The range is 4 - 2 = 2 to 4 + 2 = 6. However, since the 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score cannot exceed 5, the effective range is 2 to 5.
- **Group D:** The range is 5 - 2 = 3 to 5 + 2 = 7. However, since the 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score cannot exceed 5, the effective range is 3 to 5.

### Step 3: Identify Respondents Whose 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' Falls Within the Determined Range for Their Group

- **Group A:** 
  - Respondent 42 has a 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score of 3, which falls within the range.
  - Respondent 6 has a 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score of 1, which does not fall within the range.
- **Group B:**
  - Respondent 66 has a 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' score of 2, which falls within the range.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents whose 'System_Complexity' is within 1 point of the highest 'Cumbersome_to_Use' for their group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to identify the highest 'Cumbersome_to_Use' score for each group and then find the respondents whose 'System_Complexity' score is within 1 point of that highest score.

### Step 1: Identify the Highest 'Cumbersome_to_Use' Score for Each Group

- **Group A:** 
  - Respondent 35: 'Cumbersome_to_Use' = 5
  - Respondent 89: 'Cumbersome_to_Use' = 1
  - Respondent 11: 'Cumbersome_to_Use' = 1

  - Respondent 47: 'Cumbersome_to_Use' = 1
  - Respondent 32: 'Cumbersome_to_Use' = 1
  - Respondent 61: 'Cumbersome_to_Use' = 5
  - Highest 'Cumbersome_to_Use' for Group B = 5

- **Group C:**
  - Respondent 82: 'Cumbersome_to_Use' = 2
  - Respondent 43: 'Cumbersome_to_Use' = 1
  - Highest 'Cumbersome_to_Use' for Group C = 2
