</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the System_Complexity of the respondent from the Middle group?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to find the respondent from the Middle group and then determine their System_Complexity.

From the 'questions' section, we know that the group options are ""[MCQ: A. Senior B. Junior C. Middle D. Intern]"". 

Looking at the 'responses' section, we can see that the respondents with their respective groups are:
- Respondent74: Group ""D"" (Intern)
- Respondent5: Group ""C"" (Middle)
- Respondent55: Group ""A"" (Senior)
- Respondent62: Group ""C"" (Middle)
- Respondent2: Group ""C"" (Middle)

The respondents from the Middle group are Respondent5, Respondent62, and Respondent2.

Now, we need to find the System_Complexity for each of these respondents:
- Respondent5: System_Complexity ""1""
- Respondent62: System_Complexity ""1""
- Respondent2: System_Complexity ""1""

According to the 'questions' section, the System_Complexity is measured on a Likert scale of 1-5, where 1 = Strongly Disagree and 5 = Strongly Agree with the statement ""I found the system unnecessarily complex"".

Since all respondents from the Middle group have a System_Complexity of ""1"", this means they all Strongly Disagree with the statement that the system is unnecessarily complex.

The final answer is: Strongly Disagree",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the Frequent_Usage of the respondent from the Senior group?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to find the respondent from the Senior group and then determine their Frequent_Usage score.

From the 'questions' section, we know that the Senior group is represented by the letter ""A"" in the Group field.

Looking at the 'responses' section, we can see that there are several respondents from the Senior group (Group ""A""). The Frequent_Usage scores for these respondents are:

- Respondent58: ""2""
- Respondent72: ""5""
- Respondent76: ""1""

Since the question asks for the Frequent_Usage of the respondent from the Senior group, but does not specify which one, we cannot provide a single answer based on the given instructions. However, following the format strictly as requested and considering the possibility that the question might be aiming for a specific respondent but lacking in specificity, I will provide an answer based on the first respondent from the Senior group listed, which is Respondent58.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
What is the Ease_of_Learning of the respondent from the Senior group?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to find the respondent from the Senior group and then determine their Ease_of_Learning score.

From the 'questions' section, we know that the Senior group is represented by the letter ""A"" in the Group field.

Looking at the 'responses' section, we can see that the following respondents are from the Senior group (Group ""A""):
:Respondent34
:Respondent38
:Respondent86

Now, we need to find the Ease_of_Learning score for each of these respondents:
:Respondent34 has an Ease_of_Learning score of ""2""
:Respondent38 has an Ease_of_Learning score of ""4""
:Respondent86 has an Ease_of_Learning score of ""5""

Since the question asks for the Ease_of_Learning of the respondent from the Senior group, and there are multiple respondents from this group, the question is ambiguous. However, based on the provided data, the Ease_of_Learning scores for the Senior group respondents are 2, 4, and 5.

But, the question seems to be asking for a single value. Given the data provided, it seems there might be an expectation of a single respondent or an average, but neither is specified. Without further clarification, the most direct interpretation of the question as posed would be to list the scores, but since the format asks for a ""human-readable value"" and given the constraints, it seems we're expected to find a single respondent's answer or handle the ambiguity in a way that provides a clear, final answer.

Given the strict format requirements and the ambiguity in the question, a precise answer following the format to the letter as requested isn't feasible without assuming the question seeks a specific respondent's answer or an aggregate (like an average) which isn't specified. However, to adhere to the format and provide a final answer based on the data given and the assumption that we're looking for a direct answer related to the Senior group's Ease_of_Learning without additional context:

The final answer is: 2",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
What is the Confidence_in_Use of the respondent from the Middle group?
</task>","To answer this question, we first need to identify the respondents from the Middle group and then find their Confidence_in_Use scores.

From the 'questions' section, we understand that the group of the respondent is categorized as ""A. Senior B. Junior C. Middle D. Intern"". Therefore, we are looking for respondents with ""C"" as their group answer, which corresponds to ""Middle"".

Looking through the 'responses' section, we find the following respondents who belong to the Middle group (Group ""C""):

1. :Respondent87
2. :Respondent51
3. :Respondent19

Now, we need to find their Confidence_in_Use scores:

1. :Respondent87 - pred:Confidence_in_Use ""5""
2. :Respondent51 - pred:Confidence_in_Use ""5""
3. :Respondent19 - pred:Confidence_in_Use ""4""

Since the question asks for the Confidence_in_Use of the respondent from the Middle group without specifying which one if there are multiple, and given the format instructions which imply a single answer is expected but do not specify how to handle multiple respondents, we will provide the scores for all Middle group respondents as the question does not provide enough detail for a singular answer. However, following the format strictly as requested and assuming we need a single, representative answer or given the lack of specificity, we might interpret the task as seeking a common or notable response among them.

Given the provided format and the nature of the question, it seems most appropriate to select a response that is either common among the group or notable in some way. Both Respondent87 and Respondent51 have a Confidence_in_Use score of ""5"", which is the highest score and common among two of the respondents, suggesting a high level of confidence in using the system among some in the Middle group.

The final answer is: 5",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
What is the Confidence_in_Use of the respondent from the Junior group?
</task>","To answer this question, we first need to identify the respondent from the Junior group and then find their Confidence_in_Use score.

From the 'questions' section, we understand that the group of the respondent is categorized as ""A. Senior B. Junior C. Middle D. Intern"". 

Looking at the 'responses' section, we find that :Respondent61 is the one who belongs to the ""B"" group, which corresponds to ""Junior"" according to the schema.

The Confidence_in_Use score for :Respondent61 is ""1"", which according to the schema for :QConfidence_in_Use, means ""1 = Strongly Disagree"". However, the output should be based on the human-readable value related to the score if it directly maps to an option, but in this case, it's a Likert scale. The question asks for the Confidence_in_Use, which is a score, not an MCQ option that needs mapping. 

Therefore, the Confidence_in_Use of the respondent from the Junior group is directly the score they provided, as it reflects their level of confidence on a scale rather than selecting from predefined options.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$",True

<task>
What is the Cumbersome_to_Use of the respondent whose combined score for Need_for_Technical_Support and Integration_of_Functions was exactly 6?
</task>","To find the Cumbersome_to_Use score of the respondent whose combined score for Need_for_Technical_Support and Integration_of_Functions was exactly 6, we need to examine each respondent's data.

1. Respondent26: Need_for_Technical_Support = 2, Integration_of_Functions = 4, Combined = 6
2. Respondent85: Need_for_Technical_Support = 1, Integration_of_Functions = 5, Combined = 6
3. Respondent27: Need_for_Technical_Support = 4, Integration_of_Functions = 2, Combined = 6
4. Respondent56: Need_for_Technical_Support = 1, Integration_of_Functions = 5, Combined = 6
5. Respondent77: Need_for_Technical_Support = 1, Integration_of_Functions = 4, Combined = 5 (does not meet the criteria)

The respondents who meet the criteria are Respondent26, Respondent85, Respondent27, and Respondent56.

- Respondent26: Cumbersome_to_Use = 2
- Respondent85: Cumbersome_to_Use = 1
- Respondent27: Cumbersome_to_Use = 5
- Respondent56: Cumbersome_to_Use = 1

Since the question asks for the Cumbersome_to_Use score of the respondent whose combined score for Need_for_Technical_Support and Integration_of_Functions was exactly 6, and there are multiple respondents meeting this condition with different Cumbersome_to_Use scores, the task's request for a single answer cannot be directly fulfilled based on the provided instructions for output format. However, following the format strictly as requested and considering the nature of the question, it seems there might be an oversight in how the question is framed regarding handling multiple correct respondents. Given this, I will provide the scores as they are, separated by commas, as this seems to be the closest adherence to the requested format while still conveying the necessary information:

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
What is the Ease_of_Use of the respondent whose combined score for System_Complexity and Confidence_in_Use was exactly 8?
</task>","To find the Ease_of_Use of the respondent whose combined score for System_Complexity and Confidence_in_Use was exactly 8, we need to examine each respondent's scores for these two questions and then find the corresponding Ease_of_Use score.

From the 'responses' section:

- Respondent84: System_Complexity = 3, Confidence_in_Use = 5, Combined = 8
- Respondent62: System_Complexity = 1, Confidence_in_Use = 5, Combined = 6
- Respondent90: System_Complexity = 1, Confidence_in_Use = 5, Combined = 6
- Respondent36: System_Complexity = 1, Confidence_in_Use = 4, Combined = 5
- Respondent37: System_Complexity = 1, Confidence_in_Use = 5, Combined = 6

Only Respondent84 has a combined score of exactly 8 for System_Complexity and Confidence_in_Use. 

The Ease_of_Use score for Respondent84 is ""1"". 

According to the schema, Ease_of_Use is measured on a Likert scale of 1–5, where 1 = Strongly Disagree and 5 = Strongly Agree, in response to the statement ""I thought the system was easy to use."" Therefore, a score of ""1"" means the respondent Strongly Disagrees with the statement that the system was easy to use.

The final answer is: Strongly Disagree",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
What is the Inconsistency of the respondent from the Intern group who rated Need_to_Learn_Before_Use as 1 and Ease_of_Use as 4?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to find the respondent who belongs to the Intern group, rated Need_to_Learn_Before_Use as 1, and Ease_of_Use as 4, and then determine their rating for Inconsistency.

From the 'questions' section, we understand that the Intern group is represented by the letter ""D"" in the Group question.

Looking through the 'responses' section, we find:

- Respondent17 does not match because they are in group ""C"".
- Respondent70 does not match because they are in group ""C"".
- Respondent77 matches the group ""D"" and has the correct ratings for Need_to_Learn_Before_Use (""1"") and Ease_of_Use (""5""), but Ease_of_Use does not match our criteria.
- Respondent29 matches the group ""D"", has Need_to_Learn_Before_Use rated as ""1"", and Ease_of_Use rated as ""4"", which fits our criteria.

Respondent29's rating for Inconsistency is ""1"".

According to the schema, Inconsistency is rated on a Likert scale of 1–5, where 1 = Strongly Disagree. Therefore, the Inconsistency of the respondent from the Intern group who rated Need_to_Learn_Before_Use as 1 and Ease_of_Use as 4 is ""1"", which corresponds to ""Strongly Disagree"".

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
What is the Inconsistency of the respondent from the Junior group with the highest Ease_of_Use score?
</task>","To answer this question, we first need to identify the respondents from the Junior group and then find the one with the highest Ease_of_Use score. After that, we will determine the Inconsistency score of that respondent.

From the 'questions' section, we understand that the group is identified by the question :QGroup with options A. Senior, B. Junior, C. Middle, D. Intern. Thus, respondents from the Junior group will have ""B"" as their answer to the :QGroup question.

Looking through the 'responses' section, we find the following respondents from the Junior group (Group ""B""):

- :Respondent66
- :Respondent3

Their Ease_of_Use scores are:
- :Respondent66: 5
- :Respondent3: 3

The respondent with the highest Ease_of_Use score from the Junior group is :Respondent66 with a score of 5.

Now, we look at the Inconsistency score for :Respondent66, which is:
pred:Inconsistency ""2""

Thus, the Inconsistency of the respondent from the Junior group with the highest Ease_of_Use score is 2, which corresponds to the answer ""2"" on the Likert scale for the question :QInconsistency. Since the question asks for the human-readable value and given the scale is 1 = Strongly Disagree to 5 = Strongly Agree for the statement ""I thought there was too much inconsistency in this system"", the value ""2"" translates to a position between Strongly Disagree and Neutral, but the exact text for this value is not provided in the schema. However, following the format for output as instructed, we should provide the numerical value as it directly answers the question without further interpretation.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$",True

  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the Frequent_Usage of the respondent from the Middle group who rated Need_to_Learn_Before_Use as 1 and Integration_of_Functions as 5?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to analyze the 'responses' section and find the respondent who belongs to the ""Middle"" group, rated ""Need_to_Learn_Before_Use"" as 1, and ""Integration_of_Functions"" as 5. Then, we will determine their ""Frequent_Usage"" score.

From the 'questions' section, we understand that the ""Group"" is categorized as ""[MCQ: A. Senior B. Junior C. Middle D. Intern]"". Therefore, the ""Middle"" group corresponds to option ""C"".

Looking through the responses:

- Respondent70 is in group ""C"" (Middle), has ""Need_to_Learn_Before_Use"" as 1, and ""Integration_of_Functions"" as 5. Their ""Frequent_Usage"" score is 5.
- Respondent4 is also in group ""C"" (Middle), has ""Need_to_Learn_Before_Use"" as 1, and ""Integration_of_Functions"" as 3, which does not match our criteria for ""Integration_of_Functions"" being 5.

Thus, the respondent from the Middle group who rated ""Need_to_Learn_Before_Use"" as 1 and ""Integration_of_Functions"" as 5 is Respondent70, and their ""Frequent_Usage"" score is 5.

The final answer is: 5",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
What is the Confidence_in_Use of the respondent from the Intern group with the highest Cumbersome_to_Use score?
</task>","To answer this question, we first need to identify the respondents from the Intern group, which corresponds to the group ""D"" according to the schema. Then, we need to find among these respondents the one with the highest Cumbersome_to_Use score. Finally, we will determine the Confidence_in_Use score of this respondent.

From the 'responses' section, the respondents from the Intern group (""D"") are:
- Respondent10
- Respondent31
- Respondent64
- Respondent90

Now, let's look at their Cumbersome_to_Use scores:
- Respondent10: ""1""
- Respondent31: ""3""
- Respondent64: ""4""
- Respondent90: ""2""

The respondent with the highest Cumbersome_to_Use score is Respondent64 with a score of ""4"".

Next, we need to find the Confidence_in_Use score of Respondent64:
- Respondent64: pred:Confidence_in_Use ""2""

Therefore, the Confidence_in_Use of the respondent from the Intern group with the highest Cumbersome_to_Use score is 2.",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
What is the Frequent_Usage of the respondent from the Senior group with the lowest Integration_of_Functions score?
</task>","To answer this question, we first need to identify the respondents from the Senior group, and then find the one with the lowest Integration_of_Functions score. Finally, we will determine the Frequent_Usage of that respondent.

From the 'questions' section, we understand that the group of the respondent is categorized as ""A. Senior"", among other options.

Looking at the 'responses' section, we find the respondent from the Senior group:
:Respondent81 a :Person ;
    pred:Group ""A"" ;
    ...

This respondent has an Integration_of_Functions score of ""4"".

Since there's only one respondent from the Senior group mentioned, we don't have to compare Integration_of_Functions scores among multiple Senior group respondents. 

The Frequent_Usage score for Respondent81 is ""1"".

Therefore, the Frequent_Usage of the respondent from the Senior group with the lowest Integration_of_Functions score is 1, which corresponds to ""Strongly Disagree"" according to the schema. However, the task asks for the Frequent_Usage value directly, not its interpretation.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
What is the Group of the respondent whose combined score for Inconsistency and System_Complexity was exactly 2?
</task>","To find the Group of the respondent whose combined score for Inconsistency and System_Complexity was exactly 2, we need to examine each respondent's scores for these two questions and identify those with a total score of 2.

From the 'questions' section, we understand that:
- Inconsistency is scored on a Likert scale of 1-5, where 1 = Strongly Disagree and 5 = Strongly Agree.
- System_Complexity is also scored on a Likert scale of 1-5, where 1 = Strongly Disagree and 5 = Strongly Agree.

We then look at the 'responses' section to find the relevant scores for each respondent.

For a combined score of exactly 2, the possible combinations are:
- Inconsistency = 1 and System_Complexity = 1

Upon reviewing the responses:
- Respondent43 has Inconsistency = 1 and System_Complexity = 1.
- Respondent17 has Inconsistency = 1 and System_Complexity = 1.
- Respondent44 has Inconsistency = 1 and System_Complexity = 2, which does not meet the criteria.
- Respondent20 has Inconsistency = 1 and System_Complexity = 1.
- Respondent37 has Inconsistency = 1 and System_Complexity = 1.
- Respondent56 has Inconsistency = 1 and System_Complexity = 2, which does not meet the criteria.
- Respondent33 has Inconsistency = 1 and System_Complexity = 1.
- Respondent73 has Inconsistency = 1 and System_Complexity = 1.
- Respondent8 has Inconsistency = 1 and System_Complexity = 1.
- Respondent68 has Inconsistency = 2 and System_Complexity = 3, which does not meet the criteria.
- Respondent36 has Inconsistency = 1 and System_Complexity = 1.

All of these respondents (43, 17, 20, 37, 33, 73, 8, 36) have a combined score of 2 for Inconsistency and System_Complexity. 

We now need to determine the Group for these respondents:
- Respondent43 is in Group ""C"".
- Respondent17 is in Group ""C"".
- Respondent20 is in Group ""C"".
- Respondent37 is in Group ""C"".
- Respondent33 is in Group ""C"".
- Respondent73 is in Group ""C"".
- Respondent8 is in Group ""B"".
- Respondent36 is in Group ""B"".

Since multiple respondents meet the criteria and are in different groups, the question's request for ""the Group"" is ambiguous because there are respondents in both Group ""C"" and Group ""B"" that meet the condition. However, following the format strictly and the task's implication of a singular answer, it seems there might be an oversight in how the question is framed regarding handling multiple possible answers. Given the data and the format for output, and considering the task might implicitly seek a representative or singular example (despite the ambiguity), one could argue for providing a group that meets the criteria, but it's critical to note this doesn't fully capture the complete answer.

Given the constraints of the format and the potential for misunderstanding in the task's wording, a precise answer following the instructions to the letter while acknowledging the ambiguity would be challenging. The groups that meet the criteria are ""C"" and ""B"", but the format does not accommodate multiple answers or explanations of ambiguity well.

Therefore, acknowledging the issue but attempting to comply with the format requirement for a singular final answer, and recognizing that multiple groups are represented among the respondents meeting the criteria:

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
What is the Inconsistency of the respondent from the Junior group with the highest Integration_of_Functions score?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify respondents from the Junior group.
2. Among them, find the one with the highest Integration_of_Functions score.
3. Report the Inconsistency score of this respondent.

From the 'questions' section, we understand that:
- The group of the respondent is categorized as ""A. Senior B. Junior C. Middle D. Intern"".
- Integration_of_Functions is scored on a Likert scale of 1–5, where 1 = Strongly Disagree and 5 = Strongly Agree.
- Inconsistency is also scored on a Likert scale of 1–5, where 1 = Strongly Disagree and 5 = Strongly Agree.

Looking at the 'responses' section:
- Respondents from the Junior group have ""B"" as their Group value.
- The respondents with ""B"" as their group are: Respondent8, Respondent3, Respondent23, and Respondent32.

Now, comparing their Integration_of_Functions scores:
- Respondent8 has a score of ""5"".
- Respondent3 has a score of ""2"".
- Respondent23 has a score of ""4"".
- Respondent32 has a score of ""5"".

Both Respondent8 and Respondent32 have the highest Integration_of_Functions score of ""5"". 

For Respondent8, the Inconsistency score is ""1"".
For Respondent32, the Inconsistency score is ""1"".

Since both have the same highest Integration_of_Functions score and the same Inconsistency score, we can report the Inconsistency score as ""1"", which corresponds to ""Strongly Disagree"" on the Likert scale for the question about inconsistency.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
What is the Need_to_Learn_Before_Use of the respondent from the Middle group with the lowest Confidence_in_Use score?
</task>","To answer this question, we first need to identify the respondents from the Middle group, which corresponds to option ""C"" in the :QGroup question. Then, we need to find the one with the lowest Confidence_in_Use score among them and report their Need_to_Learn_Before_Use score.

From the provided data:

- Respondent88 is from group ""C"" with Confidence_in_Use ""5"" and Need_to_Learn_Before_Use ""1"".
- Respondent82 is from group ""C"" with Confidence_in_Use ""4"" and Need_to_Learn_Before_Use ""5"".
- Respondent5 is from group ""C"" with Confidence_in_Use ""5"" and Need_to_Learn_Before_Use ""1"".

Among these, Respondent82 has the lowest Confidence_in_Use score with a value of ""4"". Therefore, the Need_to_Learn_Before_Use of the respondent from the Middle group with the lowest Confidence_in_Use score is ""5"".",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
What is the Confidence_in_Use of the respondent whose combined score for System_Complexity and Integration_of_Functions was exactly 5?
</task>","To find the Confidence_in_Use of the respondent whose combined score for System_Complexity and Integration_of_Functions was exactly 5, we need to examine each respondent's data.

The possible combinations that result in a sum of 5 are:
- System_Complexity = 1, Integration_of_Functions = 4
- System_Complexity = 4, Integration_of_Functions = 1
- System_Complexity = 2, Integration_of_Functions = 3
- System_Complexity = 3, Integration_of_Functions = 2

Let's check each respondent:

:Respondent82 - System_Complexity = 1, Integration_of_Functions = 4 (Sum = 5), Confidence_in_Use = 4
:Respondent54 - System_Complexity = 1, Integration_of_Functions = 5 (Sum = 6), Not a match
:Respondent55 - System_Complexity = 1, Integration_of_Functions = 3 (Sum = 4), Not a match
:Respondent14 - System_Complexity = 1, Integration_of_Functions = 3 (Sum = 4), Not a match
:Respondent9 - System_Complexity = 3, Integration_of_Functions = 1 (Sum = 4), Not a match
:Respondent47 - System_Complexity = 1, Integration_of_Functions = 5 (Sum = 6), Not a match
:Respondent90 - System_Complexity = 1, Integration_of_Functions = 5 (Sum = 6), Not a match
:Respondent60 - System_Complexity = 1, Integration_of_Functions = 4 (Sum = 5), Confidence_in_Use = 4
:Respondent48 - System_Complexity = 1, Integration_of_Functions = 5 (Sum = 6), Not a match
:Respondent6 - System_Complexity = 1, Integration_of_Functions = 5 (Sum = 6), Not a match
:Respondent78 - System_Complexity = 1, Integration_of_Functions = 4 (Sum = 5), Confidence_in_Use = 2

The respondents with a combined score of exactly 5 for System_Complexity and Integration_of_Functions are Respondent82, Respondent60, and Respondent78. Their Confidence_in_Use scores are 4, 4, and 2 respectively.

However, the task seems to imply a singular answer, suggesting there might be an oversight in how the question is interpreted or in the data provided. Given the data and the task as stated, there are multiple respondents meeting the criteria, but if we are to follow the format strictly and provide a single answer based on the first match or any match, we would have to choose one of these scores. 

Given the instruction to provide a ""human-readable value"" and following the format to the letter without an explicit instruction on how to handle multiple correct answers, the most straightforward approach is to report the Confidence_in_Use for the first respondent that meets the criteria, which is Respondent82.

The final answer is: 4",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
What is the Frequent_Usage of the respondent from the Junior group who rated Need_to_Learn_Before_Use as 1 and Inconsistency as 2?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to analyze the 'responses' section and find the respondent who belongs to the Junior group, rated Need_to_Learn_Before_Use as 1, and Inconsistency as 2.

From the 'questions' section, we know that the Junior group corresponds to the letter ""B"" in the Group field.

After examining the 'responses' section, we find that Respondent68 matches the given criteria:
- Group: ""B"" (Junior)
- Need_to_Learn_Before_Use: ""1""
- Inconsistency: ""2""

The Frequent_Usage of Respondent68 is ""4"".

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
What is the Integration_of_Functions of the respondent from the Intern group whose System_Complexity is higher than the average System_Complexity for the Junior group in this case?
</task>","To answer this question, we first need to calculate the average System_Complexity for the Junior group. Then, we need to find the respondent from the Intern group whose System_Complexity is higher than this average. Finally, we will determine the Integration_of_Functions for this respondent.

1. **Calculate the average System_Complexity for the Junior group:**

From the responses, we can see that there is only one respondent from the Junior group (Respondent36), with a System_Complexity of ""1"". Since there's only one respondent in this group, the average System_Complexity for the Junior group is 1.

2. **Find the respondent from the Intern group whose System_Complexity is higher than the average System_Complexity for the Junior group:**

The average System_Complexity for the Junior group is 1. We need to find a respondent from the Intern group (Group ""D"") with a System_Complexity higher than 1.

Respondent49 has a System_Complexity of ""5"", which is higher than 1.
Respondent30 has a System_Complexity of ""1"", which is not higher than 1.
Respondent74 has a System_Complexity of ""1"", which is not higher than 1.
Respondent71 has a System_Complexity of ""1"", which is not higher than 1.

Respondent49 is the one from the Intern group with a System_Complexity higher than the average for the Junior group.

3. **Determine the Integration_of_Functions for this respondent:**

Respondent49 has an Integration_of_Functions of ""5"".

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
What is the Inconsistency of the respondent from the Junior group whose Need_for_Technical_Support is lower than the average Need_for_Technical_Support for the Intern group in this case?
</task>","To answer this question, we first need to calculate the average Need_for_Technical_Support for the Intern group. Then, we need to find the respondents from the Junior group whose Need_for_Technical_Support is lower than this average. Finally, we will determine the Inconsistency of these respondents.

1. **Calculate the average Need_for_Technical_Support for the Intern group:**

From the responses, the Intern group (D) has the following Need_for_Technical_Support values:
- Respondent15: 1
- Respondent29: 1
- Respondent18: 1
- Respondent12: 2
- Respondent14 does not belong to the Intern group.

Average Need_for_Technical_Support for the Intern group = (1 + 1 + 1 + 2) / 4 = 5 / 4 = 1.25

2. **Find the respondents from the Junior group (B) whose Need_for_Technical_Support is lower than the average:**

The respondents from the Junior group are:
- Respondent36: Need_for_Technical_Support = 1
- Respondent32: Need_for_Technical_Support = 1
- Respondent14: Need_for_Technical_Support = 1

All of these respondents have a Need_for_Technical_Support value (1) that is lower than the average for the Intern group (1.25).

3. **Determine the Inconsistency of these respondents:**

- Respondent36: Inconsistency = 1
- Respondent32: Inconsistency = 1
- Respondent14: Inconsistency = 1

All respondents from the Junior group with a Need_for_Technical_Support lower than the Intern group's average have an Inconsistency of 1.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
What is the Confidence_in_Use of the respondent from the Senior group with the highest Inconsistency score?
</task>","To answer this question, we first need to identify the respondents from the Senior group and then find the one with the highest Inconsistency score. After that, we will determine their Confidence_in_Use score.

From the 'questions' section, we understand that the group of the respondent is categorized as ""A. Senior"", among other options.

Looking through the 'responses' section, we find respondents who belong to the Senior group (Group ""A""):

- Respondent13
- Respondent59
- Respondent86

Now, we compare their Inconsistency scores to find the highest one:
- Respondent13 has an Inconsistency score of ""1"".
- Respondent59 has an Inconsistency score of ""1"".
- Respondent86 has an Inconsistency score of ""3"".

Respondent86 has the highest Inconsistency score among the Senior group with a score of ""3"".

Next, we look at the Confidence_in_Use score for Respondent86, which is ""4"".

According to the 'questions' schema, the Confidence_in_Use question is rated on a Likert scale of 1–5, where 1 = Strongly Disagree and 5 = Strongly Agree. However, the output for such scales should be the numerical value as it directly corresponds to the level of agreement without needing further mapping.

Therefore, the Confidence_in_Use of the respondent from the Senior group with the highest Inconsistency score is 4.",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
What is the Need_to_Learn_Before_Use of the respondent whose combined score for Confidence_in_Use and Ease_of_Learning was exactly 10?
</task>","To find the respondent whose combined score for Confidence_in_Use and Ease_of_Learning was exactly 10, we need to examine each respondent's scores for these two questions and then identify the Need_to_Learn_Before_Use score for the respondent(s) who meet this criterion.

From the provided data:

1. **Respondent53**: Confidence_in_Use = 5, Ease_of_Learning = 5. Combined score = 10.
2. **Respondent67**: Confidence_in_Use = 5, Ease_of_Learning = 5. Combined score = 10.
3. **Respondent70**: Confidence_in_Use = 5, Ease_of_Learning = 5. Combined score = 10.
4. **Respondent90**: Confidence_in_Use = 5, Ease_of_Learning = 5. Combined score = 10.
5. **Respondent15**: Confidence_in_Use = 4, Ease_of_Learning = 4. Combined score = 8.
6. **Respondent23**: Confidence_in_Use = 2, Ease_of_Learning = 4. Combined score = 6.
7. **Respondent49**: Confidence_in_Use = 4, Ease_of_Learning = 4. Combined score = 8.
8. **Respondent29**: Confidence_in_Use = 4, Ease_of_Learning = 5. Combined score = 9.

The respondents with a combined score of exactly 10 for Confidence_in_Use and Ease_of_Learning are Respondent53, Respondent67, Respondent70, and Respondent90.

Now, we look at the Need_to_Learn_Before_Use score for these respondents:

- **Respondent53**: Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = 1
- **Respondent67**: Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = 1
- **Respondent70**: Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = 1
- **Respondent90**: Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = 1

All respondents who meet the criterion have the same Need_to_Learn_Before_Use score.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
What is the Cumbersome_to_Use of the respondent from the Senior group who rated Confidence_in_Use as 5 and Integration_of_Functions as 5?
</task>","To answer this question, we first need to identify the respondent from the Senior group who rated Confidence_in_Use as 5 and Integration_of_Functions as 5.

From the 'questions' section, we understand that the group options are given as ""[MCQ: A. Senior B. Junior C. Middle D. Intern]"". Thus, a respondent belonging to the Senior group would have ""A"" (or ""a"") as their group response.

We then examine the 'responses' section to find a respondent who belongs to the Senior group (""A""), has a Confidence_in_Use rating of ""5"", and an Integration_of_Functions rating of ""5"".

Upon reviewing the responses:
- Respondent10 is in group ""D"", not ""A"".
- Respondent52 is in group ""A"" but has Confidence_in_Use as ""3"" and Integration_of_Functions as ""4"", not matching our criteria.
- Respondent6 is in group ""A"" and has both Confidence_in_Use and Integration_of_Functions as ""5"", matching our criteria.
- Respondent76 is in group ""A"" but has Confidence_in_Use as ""5"" and Integration_of_Functions as ""4"", not matching our criteria.
- Respondent30 is in group ""D"", not ""A"".
- Respondent82 is in group ""C"", not ""A"".
- Respondent67 is in group ""A"" and has both Confidence_in_Use and Integration_of_Functions as ""5"", matching our criteria.
- Respondent20 is in group ""C"", not ""A"".

Both Respondent6 and Respondent67 match the given criteria. However, the question asks for the Cumbersome_to_Use rating of such a respondent. 

For Respondent6, Cumbersome_to_Use is ""1"".
For Respondent67, Cumbersome_to_Use is ""1"".

Given that both matching respondents have the same rating for Cumbersome_to_Use, the answer to the question is the same for both, which is ""1"". According to the schema, a rating of ""1"" for Cumbersome_to_Use means ""Strongly Disagree"" that the system is very awkward to use. However, the output format requires us to provide the human-readable value corresponding to the rating, which in this context means we should output the rating as it reflects the level of agreement with the statement, not the statement itself.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the Need_to_Learn_Before_Use of the respondent from the Senior group whose Integration_of_Functions is lower than the average Integration_of_Functions for the Intern group in this case?
</task>","To answer this question, we first need to calculate the average Integration_of_Functions for the Intern group. Then, we need to find the respondents from the Senior group whose Integration_of_Functions is lower than this average. Finally, we will determine the Need_to_Learn_Before_Use for these respondents.

1. **Calculate the average Integration_of_Functions for the Intern group:**

From the data, the Intern group respondents are:
- Respondent71 with Integration_of_Functions = 4
- Respondent74 with Integration_of_Functions = 5

Average Integration_of_Functions for the Intern group = (4 + 5) / 2 = 4.5

2. **Find the respondents from the Senior group whose Integration_of_Functions is lower than the average for the Intern group (4.5):**

The Senior group respondents are:
- Respondent46 with Integration_of_Functions = 1
- Respondent56 with Integration_of_Functions = 5
- Respondent59 with Integration_of_Functions = 5

Only Respondent46 has an Integration_of_Functions (1) lower than the average for the Intern group (4.5).

3. **Determine the Need_to_Learn_Before_Use for Respondent46:**

Need_to_Learn_Before_Use for Respondent46 = 1

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
What is the Inconsistency of the respondent from the Middle group whose System_Complexity is higher than the average System_Complexity for the Intern group in this case?
</task>","To find the Inconsistency of the respondent from the Middle group whose System_Complexity is higher than the average System_Complexity for the Intern group, we first need to calculate the average System_Complexity for the Intern group.

From the responses, the Intern group (Group ""D"") respondents and their System_Complexity scores are:
- Respondent71: 1
- Respondent41: 1
- Respondent25: 3

The average System_Complexity for the Intern group is (1 + 1 + 3) / 3 = 5 / 3 = 1.67.

Next, we look for respondents from the Middle group (Group ""C"") whose System_Complexity is higher than 1.67:
- Respondent17: System_Complexity is 1, which is not higher than 1.67.
- Respondent39: System_Complexity is 4, which is higher than 1.67.

Respondent39 is from the Middle group and has a System_Complexity higher than the average for the Intern group. The Inconsistency score for Respondent39 is 4.

According to the schema, the Inconsistency question is ""[Likert 1–5: 1 = Strongly Disagree, 5 = Strongly Agree]"" regarding the statement ""I thought there was too much inconsistency in this system."" Therefore, a score of 4 corresponds to a level of agreement that is one step below ""Strongly Agree,"" but since the output rules specify providing the human-readable value as per the schema and the question asks for the Inconsistency score directly, we interpret this as seeking the score itself as it reflects the respondent's perception of inconsistency.

The final answer is: 4",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
What is the Integration_of_Functions of the respondent from the Intern group with the lowest Ease_of_Use score?
</task>","To answer this question, we first need to identify the respondents from the Intern group, then find the one with the lowest Ease_of_Use score, and finally determine their Integration_of_Functions score.

From the 'questions' section, we understand that the Intern group is represented by the letter ""D"" in the :QGroup question.

Looking at the 'responses' section, we find that :Respondent64 is the only respondent with pred:Group ""D"", indicating they are from the Intern group.

:Respondent64 has a pred:Ease_of_Use score of ""2"" and a pred:Integration_of_Functions score of ""2"".

Since there's only one respondent from the Intern group, they automatically have the lowest Ease_of_Use score among their group.

Therefore, the Integration_of_Functions of the respondent from the Intern group with the lowest Ease_of_Use score is ""2"". However, according to the output rules, for Likert scale questions, we should provide the human-readable value. The question :QIntegration_of_Functions is on a Likert scale of 1–5, where 1 = Strongly Disagree and 5 = Strongly Agree. The value ""2"" corresponds to a level of disagreement but since the exact wording for the scale points (beyond the endpoints) isn't provided in the schema, we interpret ""2"" directly as it reflects the respondent's opinion on the integration of functions without additional context.

Given the specific instructions for output and the nature of the question, the answer should reflect the respondent's opinion as directly as possible based on the provided scale. Thus, the answer should be the numerical value reflecting their level of agreement or disagreement, as the question doesn't map to specific text values for each point on the Likert scale beyond the endpoints. 

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$",True
