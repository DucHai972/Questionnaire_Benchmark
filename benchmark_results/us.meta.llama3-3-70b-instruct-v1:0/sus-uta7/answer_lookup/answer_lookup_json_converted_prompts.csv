<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the Frequent_Usage of the respondent from the Junior group?
</task>","To find the Frequent_Usage of the respondent from the Junior group, we first need to identify which respondent belongs to the Junior group. According to the 'questions' section, the group is categorized as ""A. Senior B. Junior C. Middle D. Intern"". Thus, we are looking for a respondent with ""Group"" answered as ""B"".

Looking through the 'responses' section:

- Respondent ""80"" is in group ""A"".
- Respondent ""33"" is in group ""C"".
- Respondent ""46"" is in group ""A"".
- Respondent ""89"" is in group ""A"".
- Respondent ""84"" is in group ""D"".
- Respondent ""68"" is in group ""B"", which corresponds to ""Junior"".

So, the respondent from the Junior group is ""68"". Now, we look at their answer for ""Frequent_Usage"", which is ""4"". 

According to the 'questions' schema, ""Frequent_Usage"" is measured on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 = Strongly Disagree and 5 = Strongly Agree with the statement ""I think that I would like to use this system frequently."". Therefore, a score of ""4"" means they somewhat agree with the statement, but since the output requires a human-readable value based on the provided scale, we interpret this as their level of agreement without mapping it to a specific text, as the question directly asks for the Frequent_Usage score of the respondent from the Junior group.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
What is the Confidence_in_Use of the respondent from the Senior group?
</task>","To find the Confidence_in_Use of the respondent from the Senior group, we first need to identify which respondent belongs to the Senior group. According to the 'questions' schema, the group is identified by the question ""Group"" with options ""[MCQ: A. Senior B. Junior C. Middle D. Intern]"".

Looking through the 'responses', we find that respondent ""6"" is the one who belongs to the Senior group, as indicated by their answer to the ""Group"" question being ""A"".

Now, we look at the answer provided by respondent ""6"" to the ""Confidence_in_Use"" question, which is ""5"". According to the 'questions' schema, ""Confidence_in_Use"" is measured on a Likert scale from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). Therefore, a score of ""5"" means the respondent ""Strongly Agree"" that they felt very confident using the system.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$",True

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the System_Complexity of the respondent from the Middle group?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to find the respondent from the Middle group and then determine their System_Complexity.

From the 'questions' section, we know that the ""Group"" field is a multiple-choice question with the following options: ""A. Senior B. Junior C. Middle D. Intern"".

Looking at the 'responses' section, we can see that respondents ""5"", ""62"", and ""2"" are from the Middle group, as their ""Group"" answer is ""C"".

Now, we need to find the System_Complexity for each of these respondents. 

Respondent ""5"" has a System_Complexity of ""1"", 
respondent ""62"" has a System_Complexity of ""1"", and 
respondent ""2"" has a System_Complexity of ""1"".

Since all respondents from the Middle group have the same System_Complexity, we can conclude that the System_Complexity of the respondent from the Middle group is ""1"", which corresponds to ""Strongly Disagree"" according to the 'questions' schema.

The final answer is: Strongly Disagree",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
What is the Frequent_Usage of the respondent from the Senior group?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to find the respondent from the Senior group and then determine their Frequent_Usage score.

From the 'questions' section, we know that the ""Group"" field is a multiple-choice question with options A. Senior, B. Junior, C. Middle, and D. Intern. We are looking for respondents who belong to the Senior group, which corresponds to option A.

Looking through the 'responses' section, we find the following respondents who belong to the Senior group (Group = A):

- Respondent 58: Frequent_Usage = 2
- Respondent 72: Frequent_Usage = 5
- Respondent 76: Frequent_Usage = 1

Since the question asks for the Frequent_Usage of the respondent from the Senior group without specifying which one if there are multiple, we will provide the scores for all Senior respondents:

2, 5, 1

However, following the format instructions strictly and considering the nature of the question which seems to expect a single answer, it appears there might be an oversight in how the question is framed regarding handling multiple respondents. Given the instruction to provide a ""simple comma-separated list"" for lists of names or IDs and the lack of clarity on how to handle multiple values for a single question, the most direct interpretation based on the provided instructions would be to list all relevant scores as they pertain to the Senior group, but this does not align with the expected output format for a single value question.

Given the constraints and the format requirements which seem to imply a single answer, and without further clarification, the best approach would be to acknowledge that the question as posed does not fit the provided format for a singular final answer. However, to adhere strictly to the format and provide an answer based on the first occurrence in the data provided:

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
What is the Ease_of_Learning of the respondent from the Senior group?
</task>","To find the Ease_of_Learning of the respondent from the Senior group, we first need to identify which respondents belong to the Senior group. According to the 'questions' section, the Senior group is denoted by ""A"" in the ""Group"" field.

From the 'responses' section, we can see that respondents ""34"", ""38"", and ""86"" are from the Senior group (""Group"": ""A"").

Now, we need to find the Ease_of_Learning for each of these respondents:
- Respondent ""34"" has an Ease_of_Learning of ""2"".
- Respondent ""38"" has an Ease_of_Learning of ""4"".
- Respondent ""86"" has an Ease_of_Learning of ""5"".

Since the question asks for the Ease_of_Learning of the respondent from the Senior group without specifying which one if there are multiple, and given the format instructions which imply a single answer is expected but do not specify how to handle multiple respondents, we will interpret this as needing to provide the Ease_of_Learning for each Senior group respondent. However, following the format to the letter as requested, I will provide the values as they are, without additional interpretation:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
What is the Confidence_in_Use of the respondent from the Middle group?
</task>","To find the Confidence_in_Use of the respondent from the Middle group, we first need to identify which respondents belong to the Middle group. According to the 'questions' schema, the ""Group"" field is defined as ""[MCQ: A. Senior B. Junior C. Middle D. Intern]"". Thus, we are looking for respondents who answered ""C"" (since C corresponds to Middle) in the ""Group"" field.

Upon examining the 'responses' section, we find the following respondents who belong to the Middle group:

- Respondent ""87"" with ""Group"": ""C""
- Respondent ""51"" with ""Group"": ""C""
- Respondent ""19"" with ""Group"": ""C""

Now, we need to find the ""Confidence_in_Use"" for each of these respondents:

- Respondent ""87"" has ""Confidence_in_Use"": ""5""
- Respondent ""51"" has ""Confidence_in_Use"": ""5""
- Respondent ""19"" has ""Confidence_in_Use"": ""4""

Since the question asks for the Confidence_in_Use of the respondent from the Middle group without specifying which one if there are multiple, and given the instruction to provide a direct and concise answer, it seems the task implies finding a single value or understanding the question might be slightly ambiguous without further context. However, following the provided instructions strictly and the format for output, if we were to list or provide a single value based on the most frequent or any specific instruction, the question does not specify how to handle multiple respondents. 

Given the constraints and aiming for clarity, the most frequent Confidence_in_Use value among the Middle group respondents is ""5"", which corresponds to ""Strongly Agree"" based on the Likert scale provided in the schema for ""Confidence_in_Use"". Thus, the answer, adhering to the format and instructions provided, would focus on the scale's textual representation for the value ""5"", which is not directly provided but implied as the highest level of agreement.

Therefore, the Confidence_in_Use of the respondents from the Middle group, based on the value ""5"", would be interpreted as ""Strongly Agree"". 

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$",True

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the Group of the respondent who rated Integration_of_Functions as 5?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to examine the 'responses' section of the data and find the respondent(s) who rated 'Integration_of_Functions' as 5, and then determine their 'Group'.

From the data provided:

- Respondent ""34"" has ""Integration_of_Functions"": ""4"", which does not match.
- Respondent ""87"" has ""Integration_of_Functions"": ""3"", which does not match.
- Respondent ""82"" has ""Integration_of_Functions"": ""4"", which does not match.
- Respondent ""13"" has ""Integration_of_Functions"": ""5"", which matches.
- Respondent ""42"" has ""Integration_of_Functions"": ""5"", which matches.
- Respondent ""74"" has ""Integration_of_Functions"": ""5"", which matches.

The groups for these respondents are:
- Respondent ""13"": ""A"",
- Respondent ""42"": ""A"",
- Respondent ""74"": ""D"".

According to the 'questions' schema, these correspond to:

</task>","To answer this question, we need to find the respondent who rated System_Complexity as 2 and then determine their Group.

From the 'responses' section, we can see that there are two respondents who rated System_Complexity as 2: respondent '22' and respondent '89'.

Respondent '22' has a Group of 'C' and respondent '89' has a Group of 'A'.

Since the question asks for the Group of the respondent who rated System_Complexity as 2, we need to provide the Group for both respondents '22' and '89'.

However, following the format instructions which imply a singular answer and given that the question does not specify how to handle multiple respondents with the same System_Complexity rating, it seems there might be an oversight in how the question is framed for providing a singular final answer as requested.

Given the constraints of the format and the implication of a singular answer, it's not fully clear how to proceed without assuming the question seeks any one of the groups as an example. Thus, based on the first occurrence in the data provided:

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
What is the Frequent_Usage of the respondent from the Middle group?
</task>","To find the Frequent_Usage of the respondent from the Middle group, we first need to identify which respondents belong to the Middle group. According to the 'questions' schema, the ""Group"" field is a multiple-choice question with options A. Senior, B. Junior, C. Middle, and D. Intern. We are looking for respondents who answered ""C"" (since C corresponds to Middle).

Looking through the 'responses' section, we find the following respondents who belong to the Middle group:

- Respondent ""4"" with ""Group"": ""C"" and ""Frequent_Usage"": ""4""
- Respondent ""24"" with ""Group"": ""C"" and ""Frequent_Usage"": ""2""

Since the question asks for the Frequent_Usage of the respondent from the Middle group without specifying which one if there are multiple, and given the instructions, we should provide the Frequent_Usage value for each Middle group respondent found. However, the format instructions suggest providing a concise answer, which might imply a single value if the question's intent was to find a specific or singular example. Given the data and the instruction to follow the format to the letter, which emphasizes providing the human-readable value and does not explicitly cover multiple responses to the same question, the most direct interpretation would be to provide the Frequent_Usage value for the first Middle group respondent encountered, which is ""4"".

Therefore, the Frequent_Usage of the respondent from the Middle group is 4.",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
What is the Group of the respondent who rated Integration_of_Functions as 5?
</task>","To find the Group of the respondent who rated Integration_of_Functions as 5, we need to examine the 'responses' section of the data.

Looking through the responses, we find two instances where the respondent rated Integration_of_Functions as 5:

1. Respondent ""50"" - Group: ""C""
2. Respondent ""28"" - Group: ""A""
3. Respondent ""86"" - Group: ""A""

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
What is the Confidence_in_Use of the respondent from the Junior group?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to find the respondent from the Junior group and then determine their Confidence_in_Use.

From the 'questions' section, we know that the ""Group"" field is a multiple-choice question with the following options: ""A. Senior B. Junior C. Middle D. Intern"". 

Looking at the 'responses' section, we can see that respondent ""61"" is from the Junior group, as their answer for the ""Group"" field is ""B"", which corresponds to ""Junior"".

Now, we need to find the Confidence_in_Use for respondent ""61"". According to their answers, their Confidence_in_Use is ""1"", which means they ""Strongly Disagree"" that they felt very confident using the system.

However, the question asks for the human-readable value of Confidence_in_Use, not the degree of agreement. Since the Confidence_in_Use question is ""I felt very confident using the system. [Likert 1–5: 1 = Strongly Disagree, 5 = Strongly Agree]"", the value ""1"" corresponds to ""Strongly Disagree"" that they felt confident. 

The final answer is: Strongly Disagree",True

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the Cumbersome_to_Use of the respondent whose combined score for Need_for_Technical_Support and Integration_of_Functions was exactly 6?
</task>","To find the Cumbersome_to_Use score of the respondent whose combined score for Need_for_Technical_Support and Integration_of_Functions was exactly 6, we need to examine each respondent's answers.

1. Respondent ""26"" has Need_for_Technical_Support = 2 and Integration_of_Functions = 4, so 2 + 4 = 6.
2. Respondent ""85"" has Need_for_Technical_Support = 1 and Integration_of_Functions = 5, so 1 + 5 = 6.
3. Respondent ""27"" has Need_for_Technical_Support = 4 and Integration_of_Functions = 2, so 4 + 2 = 6.
4. Respondent ""56"" has Need_for_Technical_Support = 1 and Integration_of_Functions = 5, so 1 + 5 = 6.
5. Respondent ""77"" has Need_for_Technical_Support = 1 and Integration_of_Functions = 4, so 1 + 4 = 5.

The respondents with a combined score of exactly 6 for Need_for_Technical_Support and Integration_of_Functions are ""26"", ""85"", ""27"", and ""56"".

Now, we look at the Cumbersome_to_Use score for these respondents:
- Respondent ""26"" has Cumbersome_to_Use = 2.
- Respondent ""85"" has Cumbersome_to_Use = 1.
- Respondent ""27"" has Cumbersome_to_Use = 5.
- Respondent ""56"" has Cumbersome_to_Use = 1.

Since the question asks for the Cumbersome_to_Use score and there are multiple respondents with the specified combined score, it seems there might be an oversight in how the question is framed because it implies a singular answer. However, based on the provided data and following the instructions to the letter as requested, we cannot provide a list or multiple values as the format requests a single, direct answer.

Given the constraints of the format and the task, it seems there's an expectation for a unique respondent or a specific instruction on how to handle multiple matches, which is not provided. Therefore, I will proceed with the first match found:

What is the Ease_of_Use of the respondent whose combined score for System_Complexity and Confidence_in_Use was exactly 8?
</task>","To find the Ease_of_Use of the respondent whose combined score for System_Complexity and Confidence_in_Use was exactly 8, we need to examine each respondent's answers.

1. Respondent ""84"" has a System_Complexity score of 3 and a Confidence_in_Use score of 5, totaling 8.
2. Respondent ""62"" has a System_Complexity score of 1 and a Confidence_in_Use score of 5, totaling 6.
3. Respondent ""90"" has a System_Complexity score of 1 and a Confidence_in_Use score of 5, totaling 6.
4. Respondent ""36"" has a System_Complexity score of 1 and a Confidence_in_Use score of 4, totaling 5.
5. Respondent ""37"" has a System_Complexity score of 1 and a Confidence_in_Use score of 5, totaling 6.

Only respondent ""84"" has a combined score of exactly 8 for System_Complexity and Confidence_in_Use. 

The Ease_of_Use score for respondent ""84"" is 1, which according to the schema means ""Strongly Disagree"" that the system was easy to use. However, the output should be based on the score itself as per the instructions for Likert scale questions, which in this context seems to imply providing the score as is since the question does not explicitly ask for the interpretation of the score.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the Inconsistency of the respondent from the Intern group who rated Need_to_Learn_Before_Use as 1 and Ease_of_Use as 4?
</task>","To find the Inconsistency of the respondent from the Intern group who rated Need_to_Learn_Before_Use as 1 and Ease_of_Use as 4, we first need to identify the respondent who matches these criteria.

From the 'questions' section, we understand that the ""Group"" field is a multiple-choice question with options A. Senior, B. Junior, C. Middle, and D. Intern. The ""Need_to_Learn_Before_Use"" and ""Ease_of_Use"" are Likert scale questions rated from 1 to 5.

Looking through the 'responses' section, we find a respondent who is in the Intern group (D) and has rated Need_to_Learn_Before_Use as 1 and Ease_of_Use as 4:

- Respondent ""29"" is in group ""D"" (Intern), has ""Need_to_Learn_Before_Use"" rated as ""1"", and ""Ease_of_Use"" rated as ""4"".

Now, we look at the ""Inconsistency"" rating for this respondent. According to the data, respondent ""29"" has rated ""Inconsistency"" as ""1"".

Since ""Inconsistency"" is rated on a Likert scale from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree) with the statement ""I thought there was too much inconsistency in this system"", a rating of ""1"" means the respondent strongly disagrees with the statement, implying they found little to no inconsistency.

Therefore, the Inconsistency of the respondent from the Intern group who rated Need_to_Learn_Before_Use as 1 and Ease_of_Use as 4 is 1, which corresponds to ""Strongly Disagree"" with the presence of too much inconsistency. However, following the output rules, we provide the human-readable value related to the scale, which in this context directly translates to the scale value itself as it's a quantitative measure of agreement/disagreement.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the Inconsistency of the respondent from the Junior group with the highest Ease_of_Use score?
</task>","To find the Inconsistency of the respondent from the Junior group with the highest Ease_of_Use score, we first need to identify all respondents from the Junior group, then find the one with the highest Ease_of_Use score, and finally report their Inconsistency score.

From the 'questions' section, we understand that the ""Group"" question is a multiple-choice question with options A. Senior, B. Junior, C. Middle, D. Intern. We are interested in respondents who answered ""B"" (Junior) to this question.

Looking through the 'responses' section, we identify the respondents who belong to the Junior group by looking for ""Group"": ""B"". These respondents are ""66"" and ""3"".

Next, we compare their Ease_of_Use scores to find the highest. Respondent ""66"" has an Ease_of_Use score of ""5"", and respondent ""3"" has an Ease_of_Use score of ""3"". Therefore, respondent ""66"" has the highest Ease_of_Use score among the Junior group.

Finally, we look at the Inconsistency score for respondent ""66"", which is ""2"".

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$",True

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the Frequent_Usage of the respondent from the Middle group who rated Need_to_Learn_Before_Use as 1 and Integration_of_Functions as 5?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to find the respondent from the Middle group who rated Need_to_Learn_Before_Use as 1 and Integration_of_Functions as 5, and then determine their Frequent_Usage.

From the 'questions' schema, we know that the Middle group corresponds to option ""C"" in the Group field.

Looking at the 'responses' section, we can see that respondents ""70"", ""4"" are from the Middle group (""C""). However, only respondent ""70"" and ""4"" and ""79"" rated Integration_of_Functions as 5 and Need_to_Learn_Before_Use as 1.

The Frequent_Usage of respondent ""70"" is 5 and respondent ""4"" is 4 and respondent ""79"" is 5.

Since the question is asking for a single value, we need to check if there are multiple respondents that match the criteria. In this case, there are three respondents (""70"", ""4"", ""79"") that match, but the question is likely asking for the one with the highest frequency of usage, or it might be asking for all of them. However, based on the provided output rules, it seems we should provide a single value or a list. Given the information and the format, the best approach is to list the frequent usage values of all matching respondents.

The Frequent_Usage values are 5, 4, 5. 

The final answer is: $\boxed{4, 5}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the Frequent_Usage of the respondent from the Senior group who rated Need_to_Learn_Before_Use as 1 and Need_for_Technical_Support as 1?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to find the respondent from the Senior group who rated Need_to_Learn_Before_Use as 1 and Need_for_Technical_Support as 1, and then determine their Frequent_Usage.

From the 'questions' section, we know that the ""Group"" field is a multiple-choice question with options A. Senior, B. Junior, C. Middle, and D. Intern. We are looking for a respondent from the Senior group, which corresponds to option A.

From the 'responses' section, we can see that respondent ""6"" is from the Senior group (Group: ""A""), and they rated Need_to_Learn_Before_Use as 1 and Need_for_Technical_Support as 1.

The Frequent_Usage of respondent ""6"" is 5.

Therefore, the Frequent_Usage of the respondent from the Senior group who rated Need_to_Learn_Before_Use as 1 and Need_for_Technical_Support as 1 is 5, which corresponds to ""Strongly Agree"".

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the Confidence_in_Use of the respondent from the Intern group with the highest Cumbersome_to_Use score?
</task>","To find the Confidence_in_Use of the respondent from the Intern group with the highest Cumbersome_to_Use score, we first need to identify all respondents from the Intern group, which corresponds to the answer choice ""D"" in the ""Group"" question. Then, we will find the one with the highest Cumbersome_to_Use score and report their Confidence_in_Use score.

From the provided data, the respondents who are Interns (Group ""D"") are:

- Respondent ""10""
- Respondent ""31""
- Respondent ""64""
- Respondent ""90""

Now, let's look at their Cumbersome_to_Use scores:

- Respondent ""10"": 1
- Respondent ""31"": 3
- Respondent ""64"": 4
- Respondent ""90"": 2

The respondent with the highest Cumbersome_to_Use score is Respondent ""64"" with a score of 4.

Finally, we look at the Confidence_in_Use score for Respondent ""64"":

- Respondent ""64"": 2

Therefore, the Confidence_in_Use of the respondent from the Intern group with the highest Cumbersome_to_Use score is 2.",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the Frequent_Usage of the respondent from the Senior group with the lowest Integration_of_Functions score?
</task>","To find the Frequent_Usage of the respondent from the Senior group with the lowest Integration_of_Functions score, we first need to identify all respondents from the Senior group and then find the one with the lowest Integration_of_Functions score.

From the 'questions' section, we understand that the ""Group"" field is a multiple-choice question with options A. Senior, B. Junior, C. Middle, D. Intern. We are interested in respondents who belong to the Senior group, which corresponds to option ""A"".

Looking through the 'responses' section, we find respondents who belong to the Senior group by looking for ""Group"": ""A"" (since the option for Senior is A).

The respondents from the Senior group are:
- Respondent ""81"" with ""Group"": ""A"", ""Integration_of_Functions"": ""4"", and ""Frequent_Usage"": ""1"".

Since there is only one respondent from the Senior group, this respondent has the lowest Integration_of_Functions score by default.

Therefore, the Frequent_Usage of the respondent from the Senior group with the lowest Integration_of_Functions score is ""1"", which according to the schema for ""Frequent_Usage"" corresponds to ""Strongly Disagree"". However, the task asks for the Frequent_Usage value as per the output rules, which in this context means providing the value as it directly relates to the question's scale (1-5), without mapping it to the descriptive text.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the Need_for_Technical_Support of the respondent from the Intern group who rated Ease_of_Use as 5 and Need_to_Learn_Before_Use as 1?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to find the respondent from the Intern group who rated Ease_of_Use as 5 and Need_to_Learn_Before_Use as 1, and then determine their Need_for_Technical_Support.

From the 'questions' section, we know that the Intern group is represented by the letter ""D"".

We can then search the 'responses' section for a respondent who belongs to the Intern group (Group ""D""), has an Ease_of_Use rating of 5, and a Need_to_Learn_Before_Use rating of 1.

After searching, we find the following respondent:
{
  ""respondent"": ""30"",
  ""answers"": {
    ""Group"": ""D"",
    ""Frequent_Usage"": ""3"",

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the Group of the respondent whose combined score for Inconsistency and System_Complexity was exactly 2?
</task>","To find the Group of the respondent whose combined score for Inconsistency and System_Complexity was exactly 2, we need to examine each respondent's answers.

The combined score of 2 can be achieved in three ways: (0,2), (1,1), or (2,0). However, since the scores for Inconsistency and System_Complexity are both on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, a score of 0 is not possible. Thus, the only feasible combination for a total of 2 is (1,1).

Let's look through the responses:

1. Respondent ""71"": Inconsistency = 2, System_Complexity = 1. Total = 3.
2. Respondent ""43"": Inconsistency = 1, System_Complexity = 1. Total = 2.
3. Respondent ""17"": Inconsistency = 1, System_Complexity = 1. Total = 2.
4. Respondent ""44"": Inconsistency = 1, System_Complexity = 2. Total = 3.
5. Respondent ""20"": Inconsistency = 1, System_Complexity = 1. Total = 2.
6. Respondent ""37"": Inconsistency = 1, System_Complexity = 1. Total = 2.
7. Respondent ""56"": Inconsistency = 1, System_Complexity = 2. Total = 3.
8. Respondent ""33"": Inconsistency = 1, System_Complexity = 1. Total = 2.
9. Respondent ""73"": Inconsistency = 1, System_Complexity = 1. Total = 2.
10. Respondent ""8"": Inconsistency = 1, System_Complexity = 1. Total = 2.
11. Respondent ""68"": Inconsistency = 2, System_Complexity = 3. Total = 5.
12. Respondent ""36"": Inconsistency = 1, System_Complexity = 1. Total = 2.

The respondents with a combined score of exactly 2 for Inconsistency and System_Complexity are ""43"", ""17"", ""20"", ""37"", ""33"", ""73"", ""8"", and ""36"".

Now, let's find their respective Groups:
- Respondent ""43"": Group = ""C""
- Respondent ""17"": Group = ""C""
- Respondent ""20"": Group = ""C""
- Respondent ""37"": Group = ""C""
- Respondent ""33"": Group = ""C""
- Respondent ""73"": Group = ""C""
- Respondent ""8"": Group = ""B""
- Respondent ""36"": Group = ""B""

Since the question asks for the Group of the respondent(s) with a combined score of exactly 2, and there are multiple respondents fitting this criterion with different Groups (""C"" and ""B""), the answer should reflect all relevant Groups. However, following the format strictly and the nature of the question, it seems to imply a singular answer is expected, which might be a misunderstanding since multiple respondents fit the criteria. Given the instruction to follow the format to the letter and the implication of a singular answer, it's challenging to provide a response that accurately reflects all groups without violating the format rules.

Given the constraints and aiming to adhere strictly to the format while acknowledging the oversight in the question's expectation for a singular answer when multiple are applicable:

The final answer is: $\boxed{C}$",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
What is the Inconsistency of the respondent from the Junior group with the highest Integration_of_Functions score?
</task>","To find the Inconsistency of the respondent from the Junior group with the highest Integration_of_Functions score, we first need to identify all respondents who belong to the Junior group, which corresponds to option ""B"" in the schema. Then, we will find the one with the highest Integration_of_Functions score and report their Inconsistency score.

From the 'questions' schema, we understand that:
- ""Group"" is a MCQ field where ""B"" corresponds to ""Junior"".
- ""Integration_of_Functions"" is a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" and 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" to the statement ""I found the various functions in this system were well integrated.""
- ""Inconsistency"" is also a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ""Strongly Disagree"" and 5 means ""Strongly Agree"" to the statement ""I thought there was too much inconsistency in this system.""

Looking through the 'responses', we identify the respondents who are in the Junior group (""B"") and their Integration_of_Functions scores:
- Respondent ""8"": Integration_of_Functions = 5
- Respondent ""3"": Integration_of_Functions = 2
- Respondent ""23"": Integration_of_Functions = 4
- Respondent ""32"": Integration_of_Functions = 5

The respondents with the highest Integration_of_Functions score are ""8"" and ""32"", both with a score of 5. We need to find the Inconsistency score for these respondents:
- Respondent ""8"": Inconsistency = 1
- Respondent ""32"": Inconsistency = 1

Both respondents ""8"" and ""32"" have the same highest Integration_of_Functions score and the same Inconsistency score. Since the task asks for the Inconsistency of the respondent from the Junior group with the highest Integration_of_Functions score, and both ""8"" and ""32"" meet this criterion with the same Inconsistency score, we can report either. However, following the instructions strictly and the format for output, we should provide the human-readable value for the Inconsistency score, which corresponds to ""Strongly Disagree"" according to the schema.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the Need_to_Learn_Before_Use of the respondent from the Middle group with the lowest Confidence_in_Use score?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the respondents from the Middle group.
2. Among them, find the one with the lowest Confidence_in_Use score.
3. Report the Need_to_Learn_Before_Use score of this respondent.

From the 'questions' section, we understand that the ""Group"" field is a multiple-choice question with options A. Senior, B. Junior, C. Middle, D. Intern. We are interested in respondents who belong to the ""C. Middle"" group.

Looking through the 'responses' section, we identify the respondents from the Middle group by looking for answers where ""Group"" is ""C"". These respondents are ""88"", ""82"", and ""5"".

Now, we compare their Confidence_in_Use scores to find the lowest one:
- Respondent ""88"" has a Confidence_in_Use score of ""5"".
- Respondent ""82"" has a Confidence_in_Use score of ""4"".
- Respondent ""5"" has a Confidence_in_Use score of ""5"".

The respondent with the lowest Confidence_in_Use score from the Middle group is ""82"" with a score of ""4"".

Finally, we look at the Need_to_Learn_Before_Use score for respondent ""82"", which is ""5"".

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the Confidence_in_Use of the respondent whose combined score for System_Complexity and Integration_of_Functions was exactly 5?
</task>","To find the Confidence_in_Use of the respondent whose combined score for System_Complexity and Integration_of_Functions was exactly 5, we need to examine each respondent's answers.

1. For respondent ""82"", System_Complexity is 1 and Integration_of_Functions is 4, totaling 5. Confidence_in_Use is 4.
2. For respondent ""54"", System_Complexity is 1 and Integration_of_Functions is 5, totaling 6. This does not match.
3. For respondent ""55"", System_Complexity is 1 and Integration_of_Functions is 3, totaling 4. This does not match.
4. For respondent ""14"", System_Complexity is 1 and Integration_of_Functions is 3, totaling 4. This does not match.
5. For respondent ""9"", System_Complexity is 3 and Integration_of_Functions is 1, totaling 4. This does not match.
6. For respondent ""47"", System_Complexity is 1 and Integration_of_Functions is 5, totaling 6. This does not match.
7. For respondent ""90"", System_Complexity is 1 and Integration_of_Functions is 5, totaling 6. This does not match.
8. For respondent ""60"", System_Complexity is 1 and Integration_of_Functions is 4, totaling 5. Confidence_in_Use is 4.
9. For respondent ""48"", System_Complexity is 1 and Integration_of_Functions is 5, totaling 6. This does not match.
10. For respondent ""6"", System_Complexity is 1 and Integration_of_Functions is 5, totaling 6. This does not match.
11. For respondent ""78"", System_Complexity is 1 and Integration_of_Functions is 4, totaling 5. Confidence_in_Use is 2.

The respondents with a combined score of exactly 5 for System_Complexity and Integration_of_Functions are ""82"", ""60"", and ""78"". Their Confidence_in_Use scores are 4, 4, and 2, respectively.

Since the task does not specify how to handle multiple respondents, the most straightforward interpretation is to list the Confidence_in_Use for each matching respondent. However, following the format strictly which seems to imply a single answer and given the nature of the question, it seems there might be an oversight in how the question is framed for multiple possible answers. Given this, and to adhere to the format which expects a single final answer, I will provide the Confidence_in_Use for the first matching respondent as the final answer, acknowledging this does not fully address the potential for multiple correct responses based on the question's criteria.

The final answer is: 4",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
What is the Group of the respondent from the Intern group who rated Ease_of_Use as 3 and Inconsistency as 4?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to find the respondent who belongs to the Intern group, rated Ease_of_Use as 3, and Inconsistency as 4.

From the 'questions' section, we know that the Intern group corresponds to the letter ""D"".

Looking through the 'responses' section, we find that respondent ""25"" matches the given criteria:

- Group: ""D"" (which corresponds to Intern)
- Ease_of_Use: ""3""
- Inconsistency: ""4""

Therefore, the Group of the respondent from the Intern group who rated Ease_of_Use as 3 and Inconsistency as 4 is Intern.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the Frequent_Usage of the respondent from the Junior group who rated Need_to_Learn_Before_Use as 1 and Inconsistency as 2?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to find the respondent from the Junior group who rated Need_to_Learn_Before_Use as 1 and Inconsistency as 2, and then determine their Frequent_Usage.

From the 'questions' section, we know that the ""Group"" field is a multiple-choice question with options A. Senior, B. Junior, C. Middle, and D. Intern. We are looking for a respondent from the Junior group, which corresponds to option B.

We iterate through the 'responses' section to find a respondent who meets the given criteria:

1. Group: B (Junior)
2. Need_to_Learn_Before_Use: 1
3. Inconsistency: 2

Upon examining the responses, we find that respondent ""68"" matches these criteria:

- ""Group"": ""B"" (Junior)
- ""Need_to_Learn_Before_Use"": ""1""
- ""Inconsistency"": ""2""

The Frequent_Usage of respondent ""68"" is ""4"".

Therefore, the Frequent_Usage of the respondent from the Junior group who rated Need_to_Learn_Before_Use as 1 and Inconsistency as 2 is 4. 

Since Frequent_Usage is rated on a Likert scale from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree) with the statement ""I think that I would like to use this system frequently"", a rating of 4 corresponds to a level of agreement that is one step below ""Strongly Agree"". However, the task requires us to provide the human-readable value as per the output rules, which in this context means providing the rating as is because the question asks for the Frequent_Usage rating, not the text description of the rating.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the Integration_of_Functions of the respondent from the Intern group whose System_Complexity is higher than the average System_Complexity for the Junior group in this case?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the average System_Complexity for the Junior group.
2. Identify the respondents from the Intern group.
3. Among the Intern group respondents, find those whose System_Complexity is higher than the average calculated for the Junior group.
4. Report the Integration_of_Functions for the identified respondent(s).

**Step 1: Calculate the average System_Complexity for the Junior group.**

First, we identify respondents from the Junior group (Group = ""B"") and their System_Complexity scores:

- Respondent ""36"" with System_Complexity = ""1"".

Since there's only one respondent from the Junior group, the average System_Complexity for this group is 1.

**Step 2 & 3: Identify Intern group respondents with higher System_Complexity than the Junior group's average.**

The Intern group corresponds to Group = ""D"". We look for respondents in this group with System_Complexity > 1:

- Respondent ""49"" with System_Complexity = ""5"".
- Respondent ""30"" with System_Complexity = ""1"" does not meet the criteria since it's not higher than the average.
- Respondent ""74"" with System_Complexity = ""1"" does not meet the criteria.
- Respondent ""71"" with System_Complexity = ""1"" does not meet the criteria.

Only respondent ""49"" meets the criteria.

**Step 4: Report the Integration_of_Functions for the identified respondent.**

For respondent ""49"", Integration_of_Functions = ""5"".

However, the task requires the text description corresponding to the score, not the score itself. According to the schema, Integration_of_Functions is measured on a Likert scale (1–5), but the specific text descriptions for each score are not provided in the schema. Given the format instructions, we should output the score as it directly corresponds to the respondent's answer, assuming the question seeks the score value as the answer, since the text descriptions for the Likert scale scores are not detailed in the provided schema.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the Inconsistency of the respondent from the Junior group whose Need_for_Technical_Support is lower than the average Need_for_Technical_Support for the Intern group in this case?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the average Need_for_Technical_Support for the Intern group.
2. Identify respondents from the Junior group.
3. Among the Junior group respondents, find those whose Need_for_Technical_Support is lower than the average calculated for the Intern group.
4. Determine the Inconsistency for the identified respondent(s).

Given the data, let's proceed:

### Step 1: Calculate the average Need_for_Technical_Support for the Intern group.

Intern group respondents are those with ""Group"" = ""D"". Their Need_for_Technical_Support values are:
- Respondent ""15"": 1
- Respondent ""29"": 1
- Respondent ""18"": 1
- Respondent ""14"" is not in the Intern group, they are in the Junior group (""B"").
- Respondent ""12"" is in the Intern group (""D""): 2

Average Need_for_Technical_Support for the Intern group = (1 + 1 + 1 + 2) / 4 = 5 / 4 = 1.25

### Step 2 & 3: Identify Junior group respondents with Need_for_Technical_Support lower than the Intern group's average.

Junior group respondents are those with ""Group"" = ""B"". Their Need_for_Technical_Support values are:
- Respondent ""36"": 1
- Respondent ""32"": 1
- Respondent ""14"": 1

All of these are lower than or equal to the average Need_for_Technical_Support of the Intern group (1.25), but since we are looking for those strictly lower, we consider:
- Respondent ""36"": 1
- Respondent ""32"": 1
- Respondent ""14"": 1

All have a Need_for_Technical_Support of 1, which is lower than 1.25.

### Step 4: Determine the Inconsistency for these respondents.

- Respondent ""36"": Inconsistency = 1
- Respondent ""32"": Inconsistency = 1
- Respondent ""14"": Inconsistency = 1

Since all identified respondents have the same Inconsistency value, the answer to the question regarding the Inconsistency of the respondent from the Junior group whose Need_for_Technical_Support is lower than the average Need_for_Technical_Support for the Intern group is the same for all applicable respondents.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the Confidence_in_Use of the respondent from the Senior group with the highest Inconsistency score?
</task>","To find the Confidence_in_Use of the respondent from the Senior group with the highest Inconsistency score, we first need to identify all respondents from the Senior group and then find the one with the highest Inconsistency score.

From the 'questions' section, we understand that the ""Group"" field is a multiple-choice question with options A. Senior, B. Junior, C. Middle, D. Intern. We are interested in respondents who belong to the Senior group, which corresponds to option ""A"".

Looking through the 'responses' section, we identify respondents who are part of the Senior group by looking for ""Group"": ""A"" (since the option for Senior is A).

Respondents from the Senior group are:
- Respondent ""86""
- Respondent ""13""
- Respondent ""59""

Now, we need to find the Inconsistency scores for these respondents:
- Respondent ""86"" has an Inconsistency score of ""3"".
- Respondent ""13"" has an Inconsistency score of ""1"".
- Respondent ""59"" has an Inconsistency score of ""1"".

The respondent with the highest Inconsistency score from the Senior group is respondent ""86"" with a score of ""3"".

Finally, we look at the Confidence_in_Use for respondent ""86"", which is ""4"".

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
What is the Need_to_Learn_Before_Use of the respondent whose combined score for Confidence_in_Use and Ease_of_Learning was exactly 10?
</task>","To find the respondent whose combined score for Confidence_in_Use and Ease_of_Learning was exactly 10, we need to examine each respondent's answers.

1. Respondent ""53"": Confidence_in_Use = 5, Ease_of_Learning = 5. Combined score = 10.
2. Respondent ""67"": Confidence_in_Use = 5, Ease_of_Learning = 5. Combined score = 10.
3. Respondent ""70"": Confidence_in_Use = 5, Ease_of_Learning = 5. Combined score = 10.
4. Respondent ""90"": Confidence_in_Use = 5, Ease_of_Learning = 5. Combined score = 10.
5. Respondent ""15"": Confidence_in_Use = 4, Ease_of_Learning = 4. Combined score = 8.
6. Respondent ""23"": Confidence_in_Use = 2, Ease_of_Learning = 4. Combined score = 6.
7. Respondent ""49"": Confidence_in_Use = 4, Ease_of_Learning = 4. Combined score = 8.
8. Respondent ""29"": Confidence_in_Use = 4, Ease_of_Learning = 5. Combined score = 9.

The respondents with a combined score of exactly 10 are ""53"", ""67"", ""70"", and ""90"". 

Now, we need to find the Need_to_Learn_Before_Use for these respondents:
- Respondent ""53"": Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = 1.
- Respondent ""67"": Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = 1.
- Respondent ""70"": Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = 1.
- Respondent ""90"": Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = 1.

All of these respondents have the same Need_to_Learn_Before_Use score, which is 1. According to the schema, this corresponds to ""Strongly Disagree"".

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
What is the Group of the respondent from the Senior group who rated Cumbersome_to_Use as 1 and Need_for_Technical_Support as 5?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to find the respondent who belongs to the Senior group, rated Cumbersome_to_Use as 1, and rated Need_for_Technical_Support as 5.

From the 'questions' schema, we know that the Senior group is represented by the letter ""A"".

Looking at the 'responses' section, we can see that respondent ""11"" meets the criteria:

- Group: ""A"" (which corresponds to Senior)
- Cumbersome_to_Use: ""1""
- Need_for_Technical_Support: ""5""

Therefore, the Group of the respondent is Senior.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the Cumbersome_to_Use of the respondent from the Senior group who rated Confidence_in_Use as 5 and Integration_of_Functions as 5?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to find the respondent from the Senior group who rated Confidence_in_Use as 5 and Integration_of_Functions as 5, and then determine their rating for Cumbersome_to_Use.

From the 'questions' section, we know that the ""Group"" field is a multiple-choice question with options A. Senior, B. Junior, C. Middle, and D. Intern. We are looking for respondents from the Senior group, which corresponds to option A.

We iterate through the 'responses' section to find respondents who match the given criteria:

1. Group: A (Senior)
2. Confidence_in_Use: 5
3. Integration_of_Functions: 5

After examining the responses, we find that respondent ""6"" matches these criteria:
- Group: ""A"" (which corresponds to Senior)
- Confidence_in_Use: ""5""
- Integration_of_Functions: ""5""

Now, we look at the Cumbersome_to_Use rating for respondent ""6"", which is ""1"".

According to the 'questions' schema, Cumbersome_to_Use is rated on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means Strongly Disagree. Therefore, a rating of ""1"" for Cumbersome_to_Use means the respondent strongly disagrees that the system is very awkward to use.

The final answer is: 1",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
What is the Need_to_Learn_Before_Use of the respondent from the Senior group whose Integration_of_Functions is lower than the average Integration_of_Functions for the Intern group in this case?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the average Integration_of_Functions for the Intern group.
2. Identify respondents from the Senior group.
3. Among the Senior group respondents, find those whose Integration_of_Functions score is lower than the average calculated for the Intern group.
4. Report the Need_to_Learn_Before_Use score for the identified respondent(s).

Given the data, let's proceed:

### Step 1: Calculate the average Integration_of_Functions for the Intern group.

Intern group respondents are those with ""Group"" = ""D"". 

- Respondent ""71"" has Integration_of_Functions = ""4"".
- Respondent ""74"" has Integration_of_Functions = ""5"".

Average Integration_of_Functions for Intern group = (4 + 5) / 2 = 4.5.

### Step 2 & 3: Identify Senior group respondents and their Integration_of_Functions scores.

Senior group respondents are those with ""Group"" = ""A"". 

- Respondent ""46"" has Integration_of_Functions = ""1"".
- Respondent ""56"" has Integration_of_Functions = ""5"".
- Respondent ""59"" has Integration_of_Functions = ""5"".

We need to find Senior group respondents with Integration_of_Functions < 4.5.

- Only respondent ""46"" has an Integration_of_Functions score (1) lower than 4.5.

### Step 4: Report the Need_to_Learn_Before_Use score for the identified respondent.

Respondent ""46"" has Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = ""1"".

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the Inconsistency of the respondent from the Middle group whose System_Complexity is higher than the average System_Complexity for the Intern group in this case?
</task>","To find the Inconsistency of the respondent from the Middle group whose System_Complexity is higher than the average System_Complexity for the Intern group, we first need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the average System_Complexity for the Intern group.
2. Identify respondents from the Middle group.
3. Among the Middle group respondents, find those with System_Complexity higher than the average calculated for the Intern group.
4. Report the Inconsistency for the identified respondent(s).

**Step 1: Calculate the average System_Complexity for the Intern group.**

Intern group respondents are those with ""Group"" = ""D"". Their System_Complexity values are:
- Respondent ""71"": 1
- Respondent ""41"": 1
- Respondent ""25"": 3

Average System_Complexity for Intern group = (1 + 1 + 3) / 3 = 5 / 3 = 1.67

**Step 2: Identify respondents from the Middle group.**

Middle group respondents are those with ""Group"" = ""C"". They are:
- Respondent ""17""
- Respondent ""39""

**Step 3: Find Middle group respondents with System_Complexity higher than the Intern group's average.**

- Respondent ""17"": System_Complexity = 1, which is not higher than 1.67.
- Respondent ""39"": System_Complexity = 4, which is higher than 1.67.

**Step 4: Report the Inconsistency for the identified respondent(s).**

The respondent from the Middle group with System_Complexity higher than the average for the Intern group is Respondent ""39"". Their Inconsistency value is 4.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the Inconsistency of the respondent from the Middle group who rated Integration_of_Functions as 5 and Inconsistency as 1?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to find the respondent from the Middle group who rated Integration_of_Functions as 5 and Inconsistency as 1, and then determine their Inconsistency rating.

From the 'questions' section, we know that the Middle group corresponds to option C.

Looking through the 'responses' section, we find a respondent who matches the given criteria:

{
  ""respondent"": ""53"",
  ""answers"": {
    ""Group"": ""C"",

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the Integration_of_Functions of the respondent from the Intern group with the lowest Ease_of_Use score?
</task>","To answer this question, we first need to identify the respondents from the Intern group, then find the one with the lowest Ease_of_Use score, and finally determine their Integration_of_Functions score.

From the 'questions' section, we understand that the ""Group"" field is a multiple-choice question with options A. Senior, B. Junior, C. Middle, and D. Intern. We are looking for respondents who belong to the Intern group, which corresponds to option D.

Looking through the 'responses' section, we find the following respondents who belong to the Intern group (Group: D):

1. Respondent ""64"" with Ease_of_Use score: 2
2. No other respondents are found in the Intern group.

Since there is only one respondent from the Intern group, they automatically have the lowest Ease_of_Use score within this group. 

The Integration_of_Functions score for respondent ""64"" is 2.

Therefore, the Integration_of_Functions of the respondent from the Intern group with the lowest Ease_of_Use score is 2, which corresponds to ""Strongly Disagree"" on the Likert scale for the question ""I found the various functions in this system were well integrated."" However, the output should be based on the numerical value provided in the response, not the interpretation.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$",True
