<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the Confidence_in_Use of the respondent from the Senior group?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to find the respondent from the Senior group and then look at their response for the ""Confidence_in_Use"" question.

From the 'questions' section, we understand that the ""Group"" question is a multiple-choice question with options A. Senior, B. Junior, C. Middle, D. Intern. We are looking for a respondent who belongs to the ""Senior"" group, which corresponds to option A.

Looking through the 'responses' section, we find Respondent 6, who belongs to Group A (Senior).

Respondent 6's answer to the ""Confidence_in_Use"" question is 5, which according to the 'questions' section, means they ""Strongly Agree"" that they felt very confident using the system. Since the output should be the human-readable value and not the option code, and given that ""Confidence_in_Use"" is measured on a Likert scale from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree), the answer reflects their level of confidence.

Therefore, the Confidence_in_Use of the respondent from the Senior group is Strongly Agree, which corresponds to the value 5 on the Likert scale. However, following the output rules, we should provide the human-readable value associated with the score if it directly maps to a text description. In this case, the direct mapping from the score to a text description isn't explicitly provided for each score, but based on the instruction to follow the format to the letter and the nature of the question, the correct interpretation of the instruction leads to providing the score as it reflects the level of confidence directly.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the System_Complexity of the respondent from the Middle group?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to find the respondent from the Middle group and then determine their System_Complexity.

From the 'questions' section, we know that the Group is categorized as [MCQ: A. Senior B. Junior C. Middle D. Intern]. Therefore, the Middle group corresponds to option C.

Looking at the 'responses' section, we find two respondents from the Middle group: Respondent 5 and Respondent 2, and also Respondent 62. 

For Respondent 5, the System_Complexity is 1, which according to the 'questions' section means they Strongly Disagree that the system is unnecessarily complex.

For Respondent 2, the System_Complexity is also 1, indicating the same level of disagreement.

For Respondent 62, the System_Complexity is 1 as well.

Since all respondents from the Middle group have the same System_Complexity score, the answer would be the same for any of them. Given the scale is 1–5, where 1 = Strongly Disagree, we can conclude that these respondents found the system not unnecessarily complex.

The final answer is: Strongly Disagree",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
What is the Frequent_Usage of the respondent from the Senior group?
</task>","To determine the Frequent_Usage of the respondent from the Senior group, we first need to identify which respondents are from the Senior group. According to the schema, the Senior group is denoted by ""A. Senior"". Thus, we are looking for respondents whose ""Group"" is listed as ""A"".

From the responses provided:

- Respondent 58: Group A, Frequent_Usage: 2
- Respondent 72: Group A, Frequent_Usage: 5
- Respondent 76: Group A, Frequent_Usage: 1

These are the respondents from the Senior group. The question asks for the Frequent_Usage of the respondent from the Senior group, but since there are multiple respondents from the Senior group, the question's request is ambiguous as it does not specify which respondent to consider.

However, following the provided instructions to the letter as requested, and given that the format demands a single, direct answer without the possibility of clarifying the ambiguity in the question, I will provide the Frequent_Usage value for the first Senior group respondent listed, which is Respondent 58.

The final answer is: 2",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
What is the Ease_of_Learning of the respondent from the Senior group?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to find the respondent from the Senior group and then look at their Ease_of_Learning score.

From the 'questions' section, we know that the Senior group is represented by the letter ""A"" in the Group field.

Looking at the 'responses' section, we can see that the following respondents are from the Senior group (Group A): Respondent 34, Respondent 38, and Respondent 86.

Now, we need to find the Ease_of_Learning score for each of these respondents:

- Respondent 34: Ease_of_Learning = 2
- Respondent 38: Ease_of_Learning = 4
- Respondent 86: Ease_of_Learning = 5

Since the question asks for the Ease_of_Learning of the respondent from the Senior group, and there are multiple respondents from this group with different scores, the question is ambiguous as it does not specify which respondent to consider. However, following the provided instructions to the letter as requested, I will provide the scores as they are, but please note, the question's phrasing suggests a singular answer which cannot be accurately provided without further clarification.

Given the constraints of the format and the need to provide a ""final answer directly and concisely,"" and considering the instruction might imply looking for a specific or perhaps a range of answers but the format demands a single final answer, I will select the first respondent's score for the sake of providing an answer in the required format, acknowledging this does not fully address the ambiguity in the question.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
What is the Confidence_in_Use of the respondent from the Middle group?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to find the respondent from the Middle group and then look at their Confidence_in_Use score.

From the 'questions' section, we understand that the ""Group"" field is a multiple-choice question with options A. Senior, B. Junior, C. Middle, and D. Intern. We are looking for respondents who belong to the ""Middle"" group, which corresponds to option C.

Looking through the 'responses' section, we find the following respondents who belong to the Middle group (Group: C):

- Respondent 87
- Respondent 51
- Respondent 19

Now, we need to find the Confidence_in_Use score for each of these respondents:

- Respondent 87: Confidence_in_Use: 5
- Respondent 51: Confidence_in_Use: 5
- Respondent 19: Confidence_in_Use: 4

Since the question asks for the Confidence_in_Use of the respondent from the Middle group without specifying which one if there are multiple, we will provide the scores for all respondents in the Middle group as the question does not provide enough detail to select one. However, following the format strictly as requested, I will provide a single final answer based on the first respondent found in the Middle group, as the format does not accommodate multiple answers or explanations.

The final answer is: 5",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the Confidence_in_Use of the respondent from the Junior group?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to find the respondent from the Junior group and then look at their Confidence_in_Use score.

From the 'questions' section, we know that the group options are:
1. Group: Group of the respondent [MCQ: A. Senior B. Junior C. Middle D. Intern]

So, the Junior group corresponds to option B.

Looking at the 'responses' section, we find:
Respondent 61:
  Group: B
  ...
  Confidence_in_Use: 1

Since Respondent 61 is from the Junior group, their Confidence_in_Use score is 1, which according to the schema means ""Strongly Disagree"". 

However, the task asks for the Confidence_in_Use of the respondent from the Junior group, which is a score, not the group name or an open-ended text. The score for Confidence_in_Use is on a Likert scale of 1-5, where 1 = Strongly Disagree and 5 = Strongly Agree. The question does not ask for the interpretation of the score but rather the score itself as it pertains to the specific question about confidence in use.

</task>","To find the Cumbersome_to_Use score of the respondent whose combined score for Need_for_Technical_Support and Integration_of_Functions was exactly 6, we need to examine each respondent's scores for these two questions and then find the corresponding Cumbersome_to_Use score.

1. Respondent 26: Need_for_Technical_Support = 2, Integration_of_Functions = 4, Combined = 6
2. Respondent 85: Need_for_Technical_Support = 1, Integration_of_Functions = 5, Combined = 6

5. Respondent 77: Need_for_Technical_Support = 1, Integration_of_Functions = 4, Combined = 5 (does not meet the criteria)

Respondents 26, 85, 27, and 56 have a combined score of 6 for Need_for_Technical_Support and Integration_of_Functions. We now look at their Cumbersome_to_Use scores:

- Respondent 26: Cumbersome_to_Use = 2
- Respondent 85: Cumbersome_to_Use = 1
- Respondent 27: Cumbersome_to_Use = 5
- Respondent 56: Cumbersome_to_Use = 1

The question asks for the Cumbersome_to_Use score of the respondent with a combined score of exactly 6 for Need_for_Technical_Support and Integration_of_Functions, but it does not specify what to do if there are multiple respondents. However, based on the provided instructions and the format for output, it seems we should provide a single answer or follow the instructions to the letter as given. Since there are multiple respondents meeting the criteria and the instructions do not specify how to handle this, I will provide the scores for all matching respondents as that seems to be the most accurate way to represent the data given the constraints of the question and the output rules.

Given the constraints and the need to follow the format to the letter, it seems there might be a misunderstanding in how to present the answer based on the provided instructions, as the instructions do not cover the case of multiple correct answers explicitly. However, to adhere strictly to the format and provide a clear answer based on the data:

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the Inconsistency of the respondent from the Junior group with the highest Ease_of_Use score?
</task>","To find the Inconsistency of the respondent from the Junior group with the highest Ease_of_Use score, we first need to identify all respondents from the Junior group and then determine which of them has the highest Ease_of_Use score.

From the 'responses' section, the respondents from the Junior group (Group: B) are:
- Respondent 66
- Respondent 3

Their Ease_of_Use scores are:
- Respondent 66: 5
- Respondent 3: 3

The respondent with the highest Ease_of_Use score from the Junior group is Respondent 66, with a score of 5.

Now, we need to find the Inconsistency score for Respondent 66. According to the data, Respondent 66 has an Inconsistency score of 2.

Therefore, the Inconsistency of the respondent from the Junior group with the highest Ease_of_Use score is 2. 

Since the Inconsistency question is rated on a Likert scale of 1–5, where 1 = Strongly Disagree and 5 = Strongly Agree with the statement ""I thought there was too much inconsistency in this system,"" the score of 2 corresponds to a level of disagreement with the statement, but the exact verbal description for the score of 2 is not provided in the schema. However, following the format for output as instructed, we should provide the numerical value as it directly answers the question without requiring further interpretation of the Likert scale beyond what is given.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
What is the Frequent_Usage of the respondent from the Senior group who rated Need_to_Learn_Before_Use as 1 and Need_for_Technical_Support as 1?
</task>","To answer this question, we first need to identify the respondent from the Senior group who rated Need_to_Learn_Before_Use as 1 and Need_for_Technical_Support as 1. 

From the responses section, we can see that Respondent 6 belongs to the Senior group (Group: A) and has rated both Need_to_Learn_Before_Use and Need_for_Technical_Support as 1.

Now, we need to find the Frequent_Usage of Respondent 6. According to the responses section, Respondent 6 has a Frequent_Usage rating of 5.

Therefore, the Frequent_Usage of the respondent from the Senior group who rated Need_to_Learn_Before_Use as 1 and Need_for_Technical_Support as 1 is 5, which corresponds to ""Strongly Agree"" based on the Likert scale provided in the questions section. However, since the question asks for the Frequent_Usage value directly, the answer should reflect the scale value rather than the text description.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

What is the Frequent_Usage of the respondent from the Senior group with the lowest Integration_of_Functions score?
</task>","To answer this question, we first need to identify the respondent from the Senior group and then find the one with the lowest Integration_of_Functions score among them.

From the 'responses' section, we can see that Respondent 81 is from the Senior group (Group: A).

Respondent 81 has an Integration_of_Functions score of 4.

Since there is only one respondent from the Senior group, Respondent 81 is the one with the lowest Integration_of_Functions score by default.

Now, we need to find the Frequent_Usage of Respondent 81.

According to the 'responses' section, Respondent 81 has a Frequent_Usage score of 1.

The 'questions' schema states that Frequent_Usage is measured on a Likert scale of 1-5, where 1 = Strongly Disagree and 5 = Strongly Agree.

Therefore, the Frequent_Usage of the respondent from the Senior group with the lowest Integration_of_Functions score is Strongly Disagree.",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
What is the Group of the respondent whose combined score for Inconsistency and System_Complexity was exactly 2?
</task>","To find the Group of the respondent whose combined score for Inconsistency and System_Complexity was exactly 2, we need to examine each respondent's scores for these two questions and identify any whose total score equals 2.

From the 'questions' section, we understand that:
- Inconsistency is scored from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree) regarding the statement ""I thought there was too much inconsistency in this system.""
- System_Complexity is also scored from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree) regarding the statement ""I found the system unnecessarily complex.""

We then review the 'responses' to find a respondent with a combined score of 2 for these questions. Given that the lowest score for each question is 1, the only way to achieve a combined score of 2 is if both scores are 1.

Upon reviewing the responses:
- Respondent 43 has Inconsistency: 1 and System_Complexity: 1, totaling 2.
- Respondent 17 has Inconsistency: 1 and System_Complexity: 1, totaling 2.
- Respondent 44 has Inconsistency: 1 and System_Complexity: 2, totaling 3.
- Respondent 20 has Inconsistency: 1 and System_Complexity: 1, totaling 2.
- Respondent 37 has Inconsistency: 1 and System_Complexity: 1, totaling 2.
- Respondent 56 has Inconsistency: 1 and System_Complexity: 2, totaling 3.
- Respondent 33 has Inconsistency: 1 and System_Complexity: 1, totaling 2.
- Respondent 73 has Inconsistency: 1 and System_Complexity: 1, totaling 2.
- Respondent 8 has Inconsistency: 1 and System_Complexity: 1, totaling 2.
- Respondent 68 has Inconsistency: 2 and System_Complexity: 3, totaling 5.
- Respondent 36 has Inconsistency: 1 and System_Complexity: 1, totaling 2.

All of these respondents (43, 17, 20, 37, 33, 73, 8, 36) have a combined score of 2 for Inconsistency and System_Complexity. We now need to determine their Groups:
- Respondent 43: Group C
- Respondent 17: Group C
- Respondent 20: Group C
- Respondent 37: Group C
- Respondent 33: Group C
- Respondent 73: Group C
- Respondent 8: Group B
- Respondent 36: Group B

Therefore, the Groups of the respondents whose combined score for Inconsistency and System_Complexity was exactly 2 are C and B.",False

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the Inconsistency of the respondent from the Junior group with the highest Integration_of_Functions score?
</task>","To find the Inconsistency of the respondent from the Junior group with the highest Integration_of_Functions score, we first need to identify all respondents from the Junior group and then determine which of them has the highest Integration_of_Functions score.

From the provided data, the respondents from the Junior group (Group B) are:
- Respondent 8
- Respondent 3
- Respondent 23
- Respondent 32

Now, we compare their Integration_of_Functions scores:
- Respondent 8: 5
- Respondent 3: 2
- Respondent 23: 4
- Respondent 32: 5

Both Respondent 8 and Respondent 32 have the highest Integration_of_Functions score of 5. We then need to find the Inconsistency score for both and provide the answer based on the question's requirements.

- Respondent 8's Inconsistency score: 1
- Respondent 32's Inconsistency score: 1

Both respondents have the same Inconsistency score. Since the task does not specify what to do in the case of a tie, we can provide the Inconsistency score for either respondent as both are correct based on the given criteria.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
What is the Confidence_in_Use of the respondent whose combined score for System_Complexity and Integration_of_Functions was exactly 5?
</task>","To find the respondent whose combined score for System_Complexity and Integration_of_Functions was exactly 5, we need to examine each respondent's scores for these two questions and then identify the Confidence_in_Use score for the respondent(s) who meet this criterion.

From the provided data:

1. Respondent 82: System_Complexity = 1, Integration_of_Functions = 4, Total = 5
2. Respondent 54: System_Complexity = 1, Integration_of_Functions = 5, Total = 6
3. Respondent 55: System_Complexity = 1, Integration_of_Functions = 3, Total = 4
4. Respondent 14: System_Complexity = 1, Integration_of_Functions = 3, Total = 4
5. Respondent 9: System_Complexity = 3, Integration_of_Functions = 1, Total = 4
6. Respondent 47: System_Complexity = 1, Integration_of_Functions = 5, Total = 6
7. Respondent 90: System_Complexity = 1, Integration_of_Functions = 5, Total = 6
8. Respondent 60: System_Complexity = 1, Integration_of_Functions = 4, Total = 5
9. Respondent 48: System_Complexity = 1, Integration_of_Functions = 5, Total = 6
10. Respondent 6: System_Complexity = 1, Integration_of_Functions = 5, Total = 6
11. Respondent 78: System_Complexity = 1, Integration_of_Functions = 4, Total = 5

Respondents 82, 60, and 78 have a combined score of exactly 5 for System_Complexity and Integration_of_Functions.

Now, looking at the Confidence_in_Use for these respondents:
- Respondent 82: Confidence_in_Use = 4
- Respondent 60: Confidence_in_Use = 4
- Respondent 78: Confidence_in_Use = 2

The question asks for the Confidence_in_Use of the respondent whose combined score for System_Complexity and Integration_of_Functions was exactly 5. Since there are multiple respondents meeting the criterion and the question does not specify how to handle multiple respondents, we will list the Confidence_in_Use scores for all qualifying respondents as the question does not provide instructions for handling ties or multiple qualifying responses.

Therefore, the Confidence_in_Use scores for the respondents with a combined score of 5 are 4, 4, and 2.",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the Integration_of_Functions of the respondent from the Intern group whose System_Complexity is higher than the average System_Complexity for the Junior group in this case?
</task>","To answer this question, we first need to calculate the average System_Complexity for the Junior group. Then, we identify the respondent from the Intern group whose System_Complexity is higher than this average. Finally, we determine the Integration_of_Functions for this respondent.

1. **Calculate the average System_Complexity for the Junior group:**

Respondents in the Junior group (B) are:
- Respondent 36: System_Complexity = 1

Since there's only one respondent in the Junior group, the average System_Complexity for the Junior group is 1.

2. **Identify the respondent from the Intern group whose System_Complexity is higher than the average:**

Respondents in the Intern group (D) are:
- Respondent 49: System_Complexity = 5
- Respondent 30: System_Complexity = 1
- Respondent 74: System_Complexity = 1
- Respondent 71: System_Complexity = 1

The respondent from the Intern group with a System_Complexity higher than the average of the Junior group (which is 1) is Respondent 49, with a System_Complexity of 5.

3. **Determine the Integration_of_Functions for this respondent:**

Respondent 49's Integration_of_Functions = 5

Since the question asks for the Integration_of_Functions value, which is on a Likert scale (1–5), and not a text description, the answer directly corresponds to the numerical value given in the response.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
What is the Inconsistency of the respondent from the Junior group whose Need_for_Technical_Support is lower than the average Need_for_Technical_Support for the Intern group in this case?
</task>","To find the Inconsistency of the respondent from the Junior group whose Need_for_Technical_Support is lower than the average Need_for_Technical_Support for the Intern group, we first need to calculate the average Need_for_Technical_Support for the Intern group.

From the responses, the Intern group (D) respondents and their Need_for_Technical_Support scores are:
- Respondent 15: 1
- Respondent 29: 1
- Respondent 18: 1
- Respondent 12: 2

The average Need_for_Technical_Support for the Intern group is (1 + 1 + 1 + 2) / 4 = 5 / 4 = 1.25.

Next, we look for respondents from the Junior group (B) whose Need_for_Technical_Support is lower than 1.25. Since the lowest possible score is 1, we look for Junior group respondents with a Need_for_Technical_Support score of 1.

The Junior group (B) respondents with their Need_for_Technical_Support scores are:
- Respondent 36: 1
- Respondent 32: 1
- Respondent 14: 1

All of these respondents have a Need_for_Technical_Support score of 1, which is lower than the average for the Intern group. Now, we need to find the Inconsistency score for these respondents:
- Respondent 36: Inconsistency = 1
- Respondent 32: Inconsistency = 1
- Respondent 14: Inconsistency = 1

Since all respondents in the Junior group with a Need_for_Technical_Support score lower than the average for the Intern group have the same Inconsistency score, the answer would be the same for any of them. Therefore, the Inconsistency of the respondent from the Junior group whose Need_for_Technical_Support is lower than the average Need_for_Technical_Support for the Intern group is 1, which corresponds to ""Strongly Disagree"". 

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
What is the Confidence_in_Use of the respondent from the Senior group with the highest Inconsistency score?
</task>","To answer this question, we first need to identify the respondents from the Senior group and then find the one with the highest Inconsistency score. After that, we will determine their Confidence_in_Use score.

From the provided data, the respondents from the Senior group (Group A) are:
- Respondent 86
- Respondent 13
- Respondent 59

Now, let's look at their Inconsistency scores:
- Respondent 86: Inconsistency = 3
- Respondent 13: Inconsistency = 1
- Respondent 59: Inconsistency = 1

The respondent with the highest Inconsistency score from the Senior group is Respondent 86, with an Inconsistency score of 3.

Next, we need to find the Confidence_in_Use score for Respondent 86:
- Respondent 86: Confidence_in_Use = 4

Therefore, the Confidence_in_Use of the respondent from the Senior group with the highest Inconsistency score is 4.",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the Need_to_Learn_Before_Use of the respondent whose combined score for Confidence_in_Use and Ease_of_Learning was exactly 10?
</task>","To find the respondent whose combined score for Confidence_in_Use and Ease_of_Learning was exactly 10, we need to examine each respondent's scores for these two questions and then identify the Need_to_Learn_Before_Use score for the respondent(s) who meet this criterion.

1. Respondent 53: Confidence_in_Use = 5, Ease_of_Learning = 5. Combined score = 10.
2. Respondent 67: Confidence_in_Use = 5, Ease_of_Learning = 5. Combined score = 10.
3. Respondent 70: Confidence_in_Use = 5, Ease_of_Learning = 5. Combined score = 10.
4. Respondent 90: Confidence_in_Use = 5, Ease_of_Learning = 5. Combined score = 10.
5. Respondent 15: Confidence_in_Use = 4, Ease_of_Learning = 4. Combined score = 8.
6. Respondent 23: Confidence_in_Use = 2, Ease_of_Learning = 4. Combined score = 6.
7. Respondent 49: Confidence_in_Use = 4, Ease_of_Learning = 4. Combined score = 8.
8. Respondent 29: Confidence_in_Use = 4, Ease_of_Learning = 5. Combined score = 9.

Respondents 53, 67, 70, and 90 have a combined score of exactly 10 for Confidence_in_Use and Ease_of_Learning. We now need to find their Need_to_Learn_Before_Use scores:

- Respondent 53: Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = 1
- Respondent 67: Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = 1
- Respondent 70: Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = 1
- Respondent 90: Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = 1

All respondents who meet the criterion have the same Need_to_Learn_Before_Use score.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
What is the Cumbersome_to_Use of the respondent from the Senior group who rated Confidence_in_Use as 5 and Integration_of_Functions as 5?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to find the respondent from the Senior group who rated Confidence_in_Use as 5 and Integration_of_Functions as 5, and then determine their rating for Cumbersome_to_Use.

From the responses, we can see that Respondent 67 meets the criteria:
- Group: A (which corresponds to Senior)
- Confidence_in_Use: 5
- Integration_of_Functions: 5

The Cumbersome_to_Use rating for Respondent 67 is 1.

According to the schema, a rating of 1 for Cumbersome_to_Use means ""Strongly Disagree"" that the system is very awkward to use. 

The final answer is: Strongly Disagree",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the Need_to_Learn_Before_Use of the respondent from the Senior group whose Integration_of_Functions is lower than the average Integration_of_Functions for the Intern group in this case?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average Integration_of_Functions for the Intern group. Then, we identify respondents from the Senior group whose Integration_of_Functions score is lower than this average. Finally, we determine the Need_to_Learn_Before_Use for these identified respondents.

1. **Calculate the average Integration_of_Functions for the Intern group:**

Respondents from the Intern group (D) are: 71, 74.

- Respondent 71: Integration_of_Functions = 4
- Respondent 74: Integration_of_Functions = 5

Average Integration_of_Functions for Intern group = (4 + 5) / 2 = 9 / 2 = 4.5

2. **Identify respondents from the Senior group (A) whose Integration_of_Functions is lower than 4.5:**

Respondents from the Senior group are: 46, 56, 59, 44 (note: group B is Junior, so 44 is not Senior), 33 (note: group C is Middle, so 33 is not Senior), but actually, 44 and 33 are not in the Senior group, my mistake in including them in the list initially. The correct list should only include 46, 56, and 59.

- Respondent 46: Integration_of_Functions = 1
- Respondent 56: Integration_of_Functions = 5
- Respondent 59: Integration_of_Functions = 5

Only Respondent 46 has an Integration_of_Functions score lower than 4.5.

3. **Determine the Need_to_Learn_Before_Use for Respondent 46:**

Need_to_Learn_Before_Use for Respondent 46 = 1

What is the Inconsistency of the respondent from the Middle group whose System_Complexity is higher than the average System_Complexity for the Intern group in this case?
</task>","To find the Inconsistency of the respondent from the Middle group whose System_Complexity is higher than the average System_Complexity for the Intern group, we first need to calculate the average System_Complexity for the Intern group.

From the responses, the Intern group (Group D) respondents and their System_Complexity scores are:
- Respondent 71: System_Complexity = 1
- Respondent 41: System_Complexity = 1
- Respondent 25: System_Complexity = 3

The average System_Complexity for the Intern group is (1 + 1 + 3) / 3 = 5 / 3 = 1.67.

Next, we look for respondents from the Middle group (Group C) whose System_Complexity is higher than 1.67:
- Respondent 17: System_Complexity = 1 (does not meet the criteria)
- Respondent 39: System_Complexity = 4 (meets the criteria)

Since Respondent 39 is the one from the Middle group with a System_Complexity higher than the average for the Intern group, we look at their Inconsistency score:
- Respondent 39: Inconsistency = 4

According to the schema, the Inconsistency question is rated on a Likert scale of 1–5, where 1 = Strongly Disagree and 5 = Strongly Agree. Therefore, an Inconsistency score of 4 means the respondent somewhat agrees that there is too much inconsistency in the system, but since the output requires a human-readable value based on the provided scale, we interpret this as the respondent thinking there is ""too much inconsistency"" to a degree that is one step below ""Strongly Agree"".

However, following the instructions to provide the human-readable value directly and concisely without including the scale or interpretation beyond the provided data, the answer should directly correspond to the value given in the context of the question, which in this structured format, means providing the scale value as it directly answers the question about the level of inconsistency experienced by the respondent.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
What is the Integration_of_Functions of the respondent from the Intern group with the lowest Ease_of_Use score?
</task>","To find the Integration_of_Functions of the respondent from the Intern group with the lowest Ease_of_Use score, we first need to identify all respondents from the Intern group and then determine which of these has the lowest Ease_of_Use score.

From the provided data, the Intern group is denoted by 'D'. We look through the responses to find individuals in this group:

- Respondent 64: Group D, Ease_of_Use: 2

This is the only respondent from the Intern group. Thus, we do not need to compare Ease_of_Use scores among multiple respondents in this group, as there is only one.

The Integration_of_Functions score for Respondent 64 is 2.

According to the schema, Integration_of_Functions is rated on a Likert scale of 1–5, where 1 = Strongly Disagree and 5 = Strongly Agree, regarding the statement ""I found the various functions in this system were well integrated.""

Therefore, the Integration_of_Functions of the respondent from the Intern group with the lowest Ease_of_Use score is 2, which corresponds to ""Strongly Disagree"" that the functions were well integrated, but since the question asks for the score and not the interpretation, the answer is simply the score value as per the output rules.",True
