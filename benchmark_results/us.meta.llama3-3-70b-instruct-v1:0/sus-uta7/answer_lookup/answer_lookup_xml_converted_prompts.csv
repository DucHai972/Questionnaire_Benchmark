</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

What is the Group of the respondent who rated Cumbersome_to_Use as 4?
</task>","To find the Group of the respondent who rated Cumbersome_to_Use as 4, we need to look at the responses section and find the respondent who answered 4 to the Cumbersome_to_Use question. 

Upon examining the responses, we find that respondent '39' answered 4 to the Cumbersome_to_Use question. 

Now, we look at the answer to the Group question for respondent '39', which is 'C'. 

According to the questions schema, 'C' corresponds to 'Middle'.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
What is the Frequent_Usage of the respondent from the Junior group?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to find the respondent from the Junior group and then determine their Frequent_Usage score.

From the 'questions' section, we know that the ""Group"" question is a multiple-choice question with the following options: A. Senior, B. Junior, C. Middle, D. Intern.

Looking at the 'responses' section, we can see that the respondent with id ""68"" has answered ""B"" to the ""Group"" question, which corresponds to the ""Junior"" group.

The Frequent_Usage score for respondent ""68"" is 4.

Therefore, the Frequent_Usage of the respondent from the Junior group is 4.",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
What is the Group of the respondent who rated Cumbersome_to_Use as 1?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to find the respondent(s) who rated ""Cumbersome_to_Use"" as 1 and then determine their Group.

From the 'responses' section, we can see that the following respondents rated ""Cumbersome_to_Use"" as 1:
- Respondent 74
- Respondent 11
- Respondent 63
- Respondent 34
- Respondent 5

Now, we need to find the Group for each of these respondents:
- Respondent 74: Group D
- Respondent 11: Group A
- Respondent 63: Group C
- Respondent 34: Group A
- Respondent 5: Group C

Since the question asks for the Group of the respondent who rated Cumbersome_to_Use as 1, and there are multiple respondents with different Groups, the answer should be a list of the Groups corresponding to the respondents who rated Cumbersome_to_Use as 1.

The final answer is: D, A, C, A, C",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the Confidence_in_Use of the respondent from the Senior group?
</task>","To find the Confidence_in_Use of the respondent from the Senior group, we first need to identify which respondent belongs to the Senior group. According to the schema, the group is identified by the question ""Group"" with options ""[MCQ: A. Senior B. Junior C. Middle D. Intern]"".

Looking through the responses, the respondent with id ""6"" has answered ""A"" to the ""Group"" question, which corresponds to ""Senior"" according to the schema.

Now, we look at the answer provided by respondent ""6"" to the ""Confidence_in_Use"" question. The ""Confidence_in_Use"" question is ""[Likert 1–5: 1 = Strongly Disagree, 5 = Strongly Agree]"". Respondent ""6"" answered ""5"" to this question.

Since ""5"" corresponds to ""Strongly Agree"" on the Likert scale provided in the schema for the ""Confidence_in_Use"" question, the Confidence_in_Use of the respondent from the Senior group is ""5"", which means they ""Strongly Agree"" that they felt very confident using the system.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
What is the System_Complexity of the respondent from the Middle group?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to find the respondent from the Middle group and then determine their System_Complexity.

From the 'questions' section, we know that the ""Group"" question has the following options: 
A. Senior 
B. Junior 
C. Middle 
D. Intern

We are looking for respondents who belong to the ""Middle"" group, which corresponds to option C.

Looking at the 'responses' section, we find the following respondents who belong to the Middle group:
- Respondent id ""5"" with answer ""C"" for the ""Group"" question.
- Respondent id ""2"" with answer ""C"" for the ""Group"" question.
- Respondent id ""62"" with answer ""C"" for the ""Group"" question.

Now, we need to find the System_Complexity for each of these respondents:
- Respondent id ""5"" has a System_Complexity of 1.
- Respondent id ""2"" has a System_Complexity of 1.
- Respondent id ""62"" has a System_Complexity of 1.

Since all respondents from the Middle group have the same System_Complexity, the answer is the same for all of them.

According to the 'questions' schema, a System_Complexity of 1 corresponds to ""Strongly Disagree"" with the statement ""I found the system unnecessarily complex.""

Therefore, the System_Complexity of the respondents from the Middle group is Strongly Disagree.",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
What is the Frequent_Usage of the respondent from the Senior group?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to find the respondent from the Senior group and then determine their Frequent_Usage score.

From the 'questions' section, we know that the ""Group"" question has the following options: 
""[MCQ: A. Senior B. Junior C. Middle D. Intern]"".

We need to find a respondent with ""Group"" answer ""A"" (which corresponds to ""Senior"").

Looking at the 'responses' section, we find the following respondents from the Senior group:
- Respondent ""58"" with ""Group"" answer ""A"" and ""Frequent_Usage"" score ""2"".
- Respondent ""72"" with ""Group"" answer ""A"" and ""Frequent_Usage"" score ""5"".
- Respondent ""76"" with ""Group"" answer ""A"" and ""Frequent_Usage"" score ""1"".

Since the question asks for the Frequent_Usage of the respondent from the Senior group, and there are multiple respondents from the Senior group, the question is ambiguous. However, based on the provided instructions and the format for output, it seems we should provide the scores as they are, since the question does not specify which respondent to choose.

Therefore, the Frequent_Usage scores for the Senior group respondents are 2, 5, and 1. 

However, following the format to the letter as requested and considering the nature of the question, it seems there might be an expectation for a single answer or a list. Given the data and the instruction to preserve the format, the most direct interpretation would be to list the scores for the Senior group, but since the format asks for a ""human-readable value"" and given the nature of the question, it seems more appropriate to clarify that there are multiple respondents. Yet, adhering strictly to the format provided without further interpretation:

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
What is the Ease_of_Learning of the respondent from the Senior group?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to find the respondent from the Senior group and then look at their answer to the ""Ease_of_Learning"" question.

From the 'questions' section, we understand that the ""Group"" question has the following options: 
A. Senior 
B. Junior 
C. Middle 
D. Intern

We are looking for respondents who answered ""A"" (Senior) to the ""Group"" question. 

Looking through the 'responses' section, we find the following respondents who are from the Senior group (answered ""A"" to the ""Group"" question):
- Respondent ""34""
- Respondent ""38""
- Respondent ""86""

Now, we look at the answers these respondents gave to the ""Ease_of_Learning"" question:
- Respondent ""34"" answered ""2""
- Respondent ""38"" answered ""4""
- Respondent ""86"" answered ""5""

Since the question asks for the Ease_of_Learning of the respondent from the Senior group, and there are multiple respondents from the Senior group with different answers, the question is ambiguous as it does not specify which Senior respondent to consider. However, following the provided instructions strictly and the format for output, it seems we should provide the answers as they are since the question does not specify further details on how to handle multiple respondents.

Given the constraints of the output format which seems to expect a single value or a list, and the instruction to preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (but the schema does not provide text for the ""Ease_of_Learning"" scores), we interpret the scores directly as they are the most straightforward representation of the respondents' answers to the ""Ease_of_Learning"" question.

Therefore, the Ease_of_Learning scores for the Senior group respondents are 2, 4, and 5. 

The final answer is: $\boxed{2, 4, 5}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
What is the Confidence_in_Use of the respondent from the Middle group?
</task>","To find the Confidence_in_Use of the respondent from the Middle group, we first need to identify the respondents who belong to the Middle group. According to the schema, the Middle group is represented by the letter ""C"".

Looking through the responses, we find the following respondents who belong to the Middle group:

- Respondent id=""87""
- Respondent id=""51""
- Respondent id=""19""

Now, we need to find the Confidence_in_Use for each of these respondents:

- Respondent id=""87"": Confidence_in_Use = 5
- Respondent id=""51"": Confidence_in_Use = 5
- Respondent id=""19"": Confidence_in_Use = 4

Since the question asks for the Confidence_in_Use of the respondent from the Middle group, and there are multiple respondents from this group with different Confidence_in_Use values, the question is ambiguous as it does not specify which respondent to consider. However, following the provided instructions to the letter as requested, I will provide the Confidence_in_Use value for the first Middle group respondent listed, which is respondent id=""87"".

The Confidence_in_Use score of 5 corresponds to ""Strongly Agree"" according to the schema for the Confidence_in_Use question, which asks ""I felt very confident using the system. [Likert 1–5: 1 = Strongly Disagree, 5 = Strongly Agree]"". 

Therefore, the Confidence_in_Use of the first listed respondent from the Middle group is ""Strongly Agree"".",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
What is the Group of the respondent who rated Integration_of_Functions as 5?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to examine the 'responses' section of the provided data and find the respondents who rated 'Integration_of_Functions' as 5. Then, we will determine their respective groups based on the 'Group' question.

From the data, the respondents who rated 'Integration_of_Functions' as 5 are:

- Respondent id=""13"" with Group=""A""
- Respondent id=""42"" with Group=""A""
- Respondent id=""74"" with Group=""D""

Therefore, the groups of the respondents who rated 'Integration_of_Functions' as 5 are A, A, and D.

Since the question asks for the group of the respondent (implying a singular respondent but the data shows multiple), and given the instruction to provide a simple comma-separated list for lists of names or IDs, we will interpret this as requesting the groups of all such respondents.

The final answer is: $\boxed{A, A, D}$",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
What is the Group of the respondent who rated System_Complexity as 2?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to find the respondent who rated System_Complexity as 2 and then determine their Group.

From the 'responses' section, we can see that there are two respondents who rated System_Complexity as 2: respondent 22 and respondent 89.

Respondent 22's Group is C (Middle).
Respondent 89's Group is A (Senior).

Since the question asks for the Group of the respondent who rated System_Complexity as 2, and there are two such respondents with different Groups, the answer should reflect both. However, following the format instructions strictly, it seems we are to provide a single value or a list as appropriate. Given the instruction to preserve capitalization and provide a simple comma-separated list for names or IDs, and considering the question's request for a group which is not explicitly asking for a list but rather a categorization, the most fitting response based on the provided instructions would be to list the groups as they are categorized in the schema, maintaining capitalization:

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the Frequent_Usage of the respondent from the Middle group?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to find the respondent from the Middle group and then determine their Frequent_Usage score.

From the 'questions' section, we know that the ""Group"" question is a multiple-choice question with the following options:
A. Senior
B. Junior
C. Middle
D. Intern

We are looking for the respondent from the Middle group, which corresponds to option C.

Looking at the 'responses' section, we find the following respondents from the Middle group:
Respondent 4: 
<answer question=""Group"">C</answer>
<answer question=""Frequent_Usage"">4</answer>

Respondent 24: 
<answer question=""Group"">C</answer>
<answer question=""Frequent_Usage"">2</answer>

Since there are multiple respondents from the Middle group, the question is ambiguous, and we cannot provide a single answer. However, based on the provided instructions, I will assume that the question is asking for the Frequent_Usage score of one of the respondents from the Middle group.

The Frequent_Usage score for respondent 4 is 4, which corresponds to a Likert scale score. According to the 'questions' section, the Likert scale for Frequent_Usage is:
1 = Strongly Disagree
2 = 
3 = 
4 = 
5 = Strongly Agree

Since the exact mapping of the Likert scale is not provided, we will assume that the scores are evenly spaced and that a higher score indicates a stronger agreement.

Therefore, the Frequent_Usage of the respondent from the Middle group is 4, which indicates a relatively strong agreement with the statement ""I think that I would like to use this system frequently.""",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
What is the Group of the respondent who rated Integration_of_Functions as 5?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to examine the 'responses' section of the dataset and find the respondent(s) who rated 'Integration_of_Functions' as 5. Then, we will determine the 'Group' for that respondent based on the provided 'questions' schema.

Looking through the responses:

- Respondent '50' has 'Integration_of_Functions' rated as 5 and 'Group' as C.
- Respondent '28' has 'Integration_of_Functions' rated as 5 and 'Group' as A.
- Respondent '86' has 'Integration_of_Functions' rated as 5 and 'Group' as A.

Therefore, the groups of the respondents who rated 'Integration_of_Functions' as 5 are A and C.

Since the task asks for the group of the respondent (implying a singular respondent but the data shows multiple), and given the instruction to provide a simple comma-separated list for lists of names or IDs, we will interpret this as requesting the groups of all such respondents.

The final answer is: $\boxed{A, C}$",False

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

What is the Confidence_in_Use of the respondent from the Junior group?
</task>","To find the Confidence_in_Use of the respondent from the Junior group, we first need to identify which respondent belongs to the Junior group. According to the schema, the group options are ""[MCQ: A. Senior B. Junior C. Middle D. Intern]"".

Looking through the responses, we find that respondent ""61"" is the one who belongs to the Junior group, as indicated by their answer to the ""Group"" question being ""B"".

Now, we look at respondent ""61""'s answer to the ""Confidence_in_Use"" question, which is ""1"". According to the schema, the ""Confidence_in_Use"" question is answered on a Likert scale of 1–5, where 1 = Strongly Disagree. 

Therefore, the Confidence_in_Use of the respondent from the Junior group is Strongly Disagree.",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
What is the Cumbersome_to_Use of the respondent whose combined score for Need_for_Technical_Support and Integration_of_Functions was exactly 6?
</task>","To find the Cumbersome_to_Use score of the respondent whose combined score for Need_for_Technical_Support and Integration_of_Functions was exactly 6, we need to examine each respondent's answers.

1. Respondent 26: Need_for_Technical_Support = 2, Integration_of_Functions = 4, Combined = 6
2. Respondent 85: Need_for_Technical_Support = 1, Integration_of_Functions = 5, Combined = 6
3. Respondent 27: Need_for_Technical_Support = 4, Integration_of_Functions = 2, Combined = 6
4. Respondent 56: Need_for_Technical_Support = 1, Integration_of_Functions = 5, Combined = 6
5. Respondent 77: Need_for_Technical_Support = 1, Integration_of_Functions = 4, Combined = 5 (does not meet the criteria)

The respondents who meet the criteria are 26, 85, 27, and 56. 

For respondent 26, Cumbersome_to_Use = 2
For respondent 85, Cumbersome_to_Use = 1
For respondent 27, Cumbersome_to_Use = 5
For respondent 56, Cumbersome_to_Use = 1

Since the question asks for the Cumbersome_to_Use score of the respondent whose combined score for Need_for_Technical_Support and Integration_of_Functions was exactly 6, and there are multiple respondents meeting this condition with different Cumbersome_to_Use scores, the question's request is ambiguous as it implies a singular answer. However, following the format strictly and the task as defined, we cannot provide a list or an explanation in the final answer box. Given the constraints of the format, I will provide the score for the first respondent that meets the criteria as the final answer, acknowledging this does not fully address the ambiguity in the question.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
What is the Ease_of_Use of the respondent whose combined score for System_Complexity and Confidence_in_Use was exactly 8?
</task>","To find the Ease_of_Use of the respondent whose combined score for System_Complexity and Confidence_in_Use was exactly 8, we need to examine each respondent's answers.

1. Respondent 84: System_Complexity = 3, Confidence_in_Use = 5, Combined = 8
2. Respondent 62: System_Complexity = 1, Confidence_in_Use = 5, Combined = 6
3. Respondent 90: System_Complexity = 1, Confidence_in_Use = 5, Combined = 6
4. Respondent 36: System_Complexity = 1, Confidence_in_Use = 4, Combined = 5
5. Respondent 37: System_Complexity = 1, Confidence_in_Use = 5, Combined = 6

Only Respondent 84 has a combined score of exactly 8. 

The Ease_of_Use for Respondent 84 is 1, which according to the schema means ""Strongly Disagree"" that the system was easy to use. However, the task asks for the Ease_of_Use, which is a Likert scale from 1 to 5. Since the output rules specify to output the human-readable value for MCQ fields but this is a Likert scale, we interpret the instruction as providing the value that corresponds to the respondent's answer in the context given.

Therefore, the Ease_of_Use is 1, which corresponds to ""Strongly Disagree"" in the context of the question about ease of use. However, following the format strictly and considering the nature of the question, the answer should reflect the value as it directly relates to the question's scale, which in this structured data, directly translates to the number given by the respondent for that specific question.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the Inconsistency of the respondent from the Intern group who rated Need_to_Learn_Before_Use as 1 and Ease_of_Use as 4?
</task>","To find the Inconsistency of the respondent from the Intern group who rated Need_to_Learn_Before_Use as 1 and Ease_of_Use as 4, we first need to identify the respondent who matches these criteria.

From the provided data, we look for a respondent with the following characteristics:
1. Group: Intern (which corresponds to option D in the schema)
2. Need_to_Learn_Before_Use: 1
3. Ease_of_Use: 4

Upon examining the responses:
- Respondent 15: Group D (Intern), Need_to_Learn_Before_Use is 2 (does not match), Ease_of_Use is 4 (matches).
- Respondent 17: Group C (Middle), does not match the group criteria.
- Respondent 70: Group C (Middle), does not match the group criteria.
- Respondent 77: Group D (Intern), Need_to_Learn_Before_Use is 1 (matches), Ease_of_Use is 5 (does not match).
- Respondent 23: Group B (Junior), does not match the group criteria.
- Respondent 29: Group D (Intern), Need_to_Learn_Before_Use is 1 (matches), Ease_of_Use is 4 (matches).
- Respondent 82: Group C (Middle), does not match the group criteria.
- Respondent 60: Group D (Intern), Need_to_Learn_Before_Use is 2 (does not match), Ease_of_Use is 5 (does not match).

Respondent 29 matches all the given criteria: they are from the Intern group, rated Need_to_Learn_Before_Use as 1, and Ease_of_Use as 4.

Now, we look at respondent 29's answer for the question ""Inconsistency"":
Respondent 29's answer for ""Inconsistency"" is 1.

According to the schema, ""Inconsistency"" is measured on a Likert scale of 1–5, where 1 = Strongly Disagree. Therefore, the Inconsistency of respondent 29 is ""Strongly Disagree"". 

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
What is the Inconsistency of the respondent from the Junior group with the highest Ease_of_Use score?
</task>","To find the Inconsistency of the respondent from the Junior group with the highest Ease_of_Use score, we first need to identify all respondents from the Junior group, which corresponds to the answer ""B"" in the ""Group"" question. Then, we find the one with the highest Ease_of_Use score and report their Inconsistency score.

From the provided data, the respondents in the Junior group (Group = ""B"") are:

- Respondent id=""66""
- Respondent id=""3""

Their Ease_of_Use scores are:
- Respondent id=""66"": 5
- Respondent id=""3"": 3

The respondent with the highest Ease_of_Use score is id=""66"" with a score of 5.

Now, we look at the Inconsistency score for respondent id=""66"":
- Inconsistency: 2

Therefore, the Inconsistency of the respondent from the Junior group with the highest Ease_of_Use score is 2, which corresponds to the answer ""2"" on the Likert scale. However, since the question asks for the human-readable value and given the scale is defined as ""1 = Strongly Disagree, 5 = Strongly Agree"" for the statement ""I thought there was too much inconsistency in this system,"" the value ""2"" does not directly map to a specific text description provided in the schema. The task requires us to follow specific output rules, but since ""2"" does not map directly to a text description like the MCQ fields do, and given the nature of the question, the most accurate interpretation of the instruction is to provide the numerical value as it reflects the degree of agreement with the statement about inconsistency.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
What is the Frequent_Usage of the respondent from the Middle group who rated Need_to_Learn_Before_Use as 1 and Integration_of_Functions as 5?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to find the respondent from the Middle group who rated Need_to_Learn_Before_Use as 1 and Integration_of_Functions as 5, and then determine their Frequent_Usage.

From the 'questions' section, we know that the Middle group corresponds to option C.

Looking at the 'responses' section, we can see that respondents 70 and 4 are from the Middle group (option C). However, only respondent 70 and 4 have a rating of 1 for Need_to_Learn_Before_Use and a rating of 5 for Integration_of_Functions is found in respondents 70 and other respondents, but the combination of Need_to_Learn_Before_Use as 1 and Integration_of_Functions as 5 and being in the Middle group is found in respondents 70 and 4.

The Frequent_Usage of respondent 70 is 5 and the Frequent_Usage of respondent 4 is 4.

Since the question is asking for a single value, it seems there might be an oversight in the question as there are two respondents fitting the criteria. However, following the instructions strictly and the format provided, I will provide the answer for the first respondent that matches the criteria, which is a common approach when the question format expects a single answer but the data provides multiple matches.

The final answer is: 5",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
What is the Frequent_Usage of the respondent from the Senior group who rated Need_to_Learn_Before_Use as 1 and Need_for_Technical_Support as 1?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to find the respondent from the Senior group who rated Need_to_Learn_Before_Use as 1 and Need_for_Technical_Support as 1, and then determine their Frequent_Usage.

From the 'questions' section, we understand that:
- The ""Group"" question has options A. Senior, B. Junior, C. Middle, D. Intern.
- The ""Frequent_Usage"" question is a Likert scale from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree).
- The ""Need_to_Learn_Before_Use"" and ""Need_for_Technical_Support"" questions are also Likert scales.

Looking at the 'responses' section, we find respondents who match the criteria:
- Respondent ""6"" is from group ""A"" (Senior), and they rated both ""Need_to_Learn_Before_Use"" and ""Need_for_Technical_Support"" as 1.

The Frequent_Usage of respondent ""6"" is 5, which according to the schema means they ""Strongly Agree"" that they would like to use the system frequently.

The final answer is: 5",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the Confidence_in_Use of the respondent from the Intern group with the highest Cumbersome_to_Use score?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the respondents from the Intern group.
2. Find the respondent with the highest Cumbersome_to_Use score among them.
3. Determine the Confidence_in_Use score of that respondent.

From the 'questions' section, we understand that the ""Group"" question is a multiple-choice question with options A. Senior, B. Junior, C. Middle, D. Intern. We are interested in respondents who answered ""D"" to this question, as they belong to the Intern group.

Looking through the 'responses' section, we find the following respondents from the Intern group (Group = D):

- Respondent 10
- Respondent 31
- Respondent 64
- Respondent 90

Now, we compare their Cumbersome_to_Use scores:
- Respondent 10: 1
- Respondent 31: 3
- Respondent 64: 4
- Respondent 90: 2

The respondent with the highest Cumbersome_to_Use score is Respondent 64, with a score of 4.

Finally, we look at the Confidence_in_Use score for Respondent 64, which is 2.

The final answer is: 2",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
What is the Frequent_Usage of the respondent from the Senior group with the lowest Integration_of_Functions score?
</task>","To find the Frequent_Usage of the respondent from the Senior group with the lowest Integration_of_Functions score, we first need to identify all respondents from the Senior group and then find the one with the lowest Integration_of_Functions score.

From the 'questions' section, we understand that the ""Group"" question is a multiple-choice question with options A. Senior, B. Junior, C. Middle, D. Intern. We are interested in respondents who answered ""A"" (which corresponds to ""Senior"").

Looking through the 'responses' section, we find the respondent with id ""81"" is from the Senior group because their answer to the ""Group"" question is ""A"".

Now, we need to find the Integration_of_Functions score for this respondent. According to the data, respondent ""81"" has an Integration_of_Functions score of ""4"".

However, to ensure this is the lowest among all Senior respondents, we should check if there are other Senior respondents with a lower Integration_of_Functions score. Upon reviewing the data again, we see that respondent ""81"" is the only one from the Senior group.

Thus, the Frequent_Usage score for the Senior respondent with the lowest Integration_of_Functions score (which is respondent ""81"") is ""1"".

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the Need_for_Technical_Support of the respondent from the Intern group who rated Ease_of_Use as 5 and Need_to_Learn_Before_Use as 1?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to find the respondent from the Intern group who rated Ease_of_Use as 5 and Need_to_Learn_Before_Use as 1, and then determine their Need_for_Technical_Support rating.

From the 'questions' section, we know that the Intern group corresponds to the answer ""D"" in the ""Group"" question.

Looking at the 'responses' section, we can see that respondent ""30"" is from the Intern group (Group = ""D""), rated Ease_of_Use as 5, and rated Need_to_Learn_Before_Use as 1.

The Need_for_Technical_Support rating for respondent ""30"" is 1.

According to the 'questions' schema, the Need_for_Technical_Support question is a Likert scale from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). Since the respondent rated it as 1, it means they Strongly Disagree that they would need the support of a technical person to use the system.

However, the task asks for the rating value itself, not the interpretation. Therefore, the answer is:

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the Group of the respondent whose combined score for Inconsistency and System_Complexity was exactly 2?
</task>","To find the Group of the respondent whose combined score for Inconsistency and System_Complexity was exactly 2, we need to examine each respondent's answers for these two questions.

The question regarding Inconsistency is scored on a Likert scale of 1-5, where 1 = Strongly Disagree and 5 = Strongly Agree. The question about System_Complexity is also scored on a Likert scale of 1-5, with the same meaning.

We are looking for a respondent with a combined score of exactly 2 for these two questions. This means the possible combinations could be (1,1), given that any other combination would result in a score greater than 2.

Let's examine the responses:

- Respondent 71: Inconsistency = 2, System_Complexity = 1. Combined score = 3.
- Respondent 43: Inconsistency = 1, System_Complexity = 1. Combined score = 2.
- Respondent 17: Inconsistency = 1, System_Complexity = 1. Combined score = 2.
- Respondent 44: Inconsistency = 1, System_Complexity = 2. Combined score = 3.
- Respondent 20: Inconsistency = 1, System_Complexity = 1. Combined score = 2.
- Respondent 37: Inconsistency = 1, System_Complexity = 1. Combined score = 2.
- Respondent 56: Inconsistency = 1, System_Complexity = 2. Combined score = 3.
- Respondent 33: Inconsistency = 1, System_Complexity = 1. Combined score = 2.
- Respondent 73: Inconsistency = 1, System_Complexity = 1. Combined score = 2.
- Respondent 8: Inconsistency = 1, System_Complexity = 1. Combined score = 2.
- Respondent 68: Inconsistency = 2, System_Complexity = 3. Combined score = 5.
- Respondent 36: Inconsistency = 1, System_Complexity = 1. Combined score = 2.

The respondents with a combined score of exactly 2 for Inconsistency and System_Complexity are: 43, 17, 20, 37, 33, 73, 8, and 36.

Now, let's find the Group for each of these respondents:

- Respondent 43: Group = C
- Respondent 17: Group = C
- Respondent 20: Group = C
- Respondent 37: Group = C
- Respondent 33: Group = C
- Respondent 73: Group = C
- Respondent 8: Group = B
- Respondent 36: Group = B

Therefore, the Groups of the respondents whose combined score for Inconsistency and System_Complexity was exactly 2 are C and B.",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the Inconsistency of the respondent from the Junior group with the highest Integration_of_Functions score?
</task>","To find the Inconsistency of the respondent from the Junior group with the highest Integration_of_Functions score, we first need to identify all respondents who belong to the Junior group, which corresponds to option ""B"" in the schema. Then, we find the one with the highest score for Integration_of_Functions and report their Inconsistency score.

From the schema:
- Group: [MCQ: A. Senior B. Junior C. Middle D. Intern]
- Integration_of_Functions: I found the various functions in this system were well integrated. [Likert 1–5: 1 = Strongly Disagree, 5 = Strongly Agree]
- Inconsistency: I thought there was too much inconsistency in this system. [Likert 1–5: 1 = Strongly Disagree, 5 = Strongly Agree]

Respondents in the Junior group (B) are:
- Respondent 8
- Respondent 3
- Respondent 23
- Respondent 32

Their Integration_of_Functions scores are:
- Respondent 8: 5
- Respondent 3: 2
- Respondent 23: 4
- Respondent 32: 5

The highest Integration_of_Functions score among these respondents is 5, which is shared by Respondent 8 and Respondent 32.

Now, we look at the Inconsistency scores for these two respondents:
- Respondent 8: 1
- Respondent 32: 1

Both respondents have the same Inconsistency score. Therefore, the Inconsistency of the respondent from the Junior group with the highest Integration_of_Functions score is 1, which corresponds to ""Strongly Disagree"". 

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the Need_to_Learn_Before_Use of the respondent from the Middle group with the lowest Confidence_in_Use score?
</task>","To answer this question, we first need to identify the respondents from the Middle group, then find the one with the lowest Confidence_in_Use score, and finally report their Need_to_Learn_Before_Use score.

From the 'questions' section, we understand that the ""Group"" question is a multiple-choice question with options A. Senior, B. Junior, C. Middle, D. Intern. We are interested in respondents who belong to the ""C. Middle"" group.

Looking through the 'responses' section, we identify the following respondents from the Middle group based on their answer to the ""Group"" question:

- Respondent id=""88"" with answer ""C""
- Respondent id=""82"" with answer ""C""
- Respondent id=""5"" with answer ""C""

Now, we compare their Confidence_in_Use scores to find the lowest:

- Respondent id=""88"" has a Confidence_in_Use score of 5
- Respondent id=""82"" has a Confidence_in_Use score of 4
- Respondent id=""5"" has a Confidence_in_Use score of 5

The respondent with the lowest Confidence_in_Use score from the Middle group is respondent id=""82"" with a score of 4.

Finally, we look at the Need_to_Learn_Before_Use score for respondent id=""82"", which is 5.

The final answer is: 5",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the Confidence_in_Use of the respondent whose combined score for System_Complexity and Integration_of_Functions was exactly 5?
</task>","To find the Confidence_in_Use of the respondent whose combined score for System_Complexity and Integration_of_Functions was exactly 5, we need to examine each respondent's answers.

The relevant questions from the schema are:
- System_Complexity: I found the system unnecessarily complex. [Likert 1–5: 1 = Strongly Disagree, 5 = Strongly Agree]
- Integration_of_Functions: I found the various functions in this system were well integrated. [Likert 1–5: 1 = Strongly Disagree, 5 = Strongly Agree]
- Confidence_in_Use: I felt very confident using the system. [Likert 1–5: 1 = Strongly Disagree, 5 = Strongly Agree]

We are looking for a respondent with a combined score of exactly 5 for System_Complexity and Integration_of_Functions. This could be achieved with scores like (1,4), (2,3), (3,2), or (4,1) for System_Complexity and Integration_of_Functions, respectively.

Let's examine the responses:

1. Respondent 82: System_Complexity = 1, Integration_of_Functions = 4. Combined score = 5. Confidence_in_Use = 4.
2. Respondent 54: System_Complexity = 1, Integration_of_Functions = 5. Combined score = 6. Not a match.
3. Respondent 55: System_Complexity = 1, Integration_of_Functions = 3. Combined score = 4. Not a match.
4. Respondent 14: System_Complexity = 1, Integration_of_Functions = 3. Combined score = 4. Not a match.
5. Respondent 9: System_Complexity = 3, Integration_of_Functions = 1. Combined score = 4. Not a match.
6. Respondent 47: System_Complexity = 1, Integration_of_Functions = 5. Combined score = 6. Not a match.
7. Respondent 90: System_Complexity = 1, Integration_of_Functions = 5. Combined score = 6. Not a match.
8. Respondent 60: System_Complexity = 1, Integration_of_Functions = 4. Combined score = 5. Confidence_in_Use = 4.
9. Respondent 48: System_Complexity = 1, Integration_of_Functions = 5. Combined score = 6. Not a match.
10. Respondent 6: System_Complexity = 1, Integration_of_Functions = 5. Combined score = 6. Not a match.
11. Respondent 78: System_Complexity = 1, Integration_of_Functions = 4. Combined score = 5. Confidence_in_Use = 2.

Respondents 82, 60, and 78 have a combined score of exactly 5 for System_Complexity and Integration_of_Functions. Their Confidence_in_Use scores are 4, 4, and 2, respectively.

The task does not specify what to do if there are multiple respondents meeting the criteria, so based on the provided instructions, we should look for a single answer. However, the question as posed does not have a unique solution based on the data provided, as there are multiple respondents who meet the condition with different Confidence_in_Use scores. 

Given the format requirements and the nature of the question, it seems there might be an expectation of a single numerical answer, which is not directly derivable from the question as it stands due to the presence of multiple qualifying respondents with different scores. 

However, following the format strictly and acknowledging the primary instruction to provide a ""human-readable value,"" and considering the possibility that the question seeks a representative or specific instance's answer without clear guidance on handling multiples, one might select a respondent's score that meets the criteria, such as respondent 82's score, for the sake of providing a concise final answer as instructed.

The final answer is: 4",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

What is the Group of the respondent from the Intern group who rated Ease_of_Use as 3 and Inconsistency as 4?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to find the respondent who belongs to the Intern group, rated Ease_of_Use as 3, and rated Inconsistency as 4.

From the 'questions' section, we know that the Intern group corresponds to the option ""D. Intern"".

Looking at the 'responses' section, we can see that respondent 25 belongs to the Intern group (since their answer to the ""Group"" question is ""D""), rated Ease_of_Use as 3, and rated Inconsistency as 4.

Therefore, the Group of the respondent from the Intern group who rated Ease_of_Use as 3 and Inconsistency as 4 is Intern.",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
What is the Integration_of_Functions of the respondent from the Intern group whose System_Complexity is higher than the average System_Complexity for the Junior group in this case?
</task>","To answer this question, we first need to calculate the average System_Complexity for the Junior group. Then, we need to find the respondent from the Intern group whose System_Complexity is higher than this average. Finally, we will determine the Integration_of_Functions for this respondent.

1. **Calculate the average System_Complexity for the Junior group:**

   - Respondent 36 is from the Junior group with a System_Complexity of 1.
   - There are no other respondents from the Junior group.
   - Therefore, the average System_Complexity for the Junior group is 1.

2. **Find the respondent from the Intern group whose System_Complexity is higher than the average System_Complexity for the Junior group:**

   - The average System_Complexity for the Junior group is 1.
   - Respondent 49 is from the Intern group with a System_Complexity of 5, which is higher than 1.
   - Respondent 30 is from the Intern group with a System_Complexity of 1, which is not higher than 1.
   - Respondent 71 is from the Intern group with a System_Complexity of 1, which is not higher than 1.
   - Respondent 74 is from the Intern group with a System_Complexity of 1, which is not higher than 1.
   - Therefore, respondent 49 is the one from the Intern group whose System_Complexity is higher than the average for the Junior group.

3. **Determine the Integration_of_Functions for this respondent:**

   - Respondent 49 has an Integration_of_Functions of 5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
What is the Inconsistency of the respondent from the Junior group whose Need_for_Technical_Support is lower than the average Need_for_Technical_Support for the Intern group in this case?
</task>","To find the Inconsistency of the respondent from the Junior group whose Need_for_Technical_Support is lower than the average Need_for_Technical_Support for the Intern group, we first need to calculate the average Need_for_Technical_Support for the Intern group.

From the provided data, the respondents from the Intern group (D) are:
- Respondent 15 with Need_for_Technical_Support = 1
- Respondent 29 with Need_for_Technical_Support = 1
- Respondent 18 with Need_for_Technical_Support = 1
- Respondent 12 with Need_for_Technical_Support = 2

The average Need_for_Technical_Support for the Intern group is (1 + 1 + 1 + 2) / 4 = 5 / 4 = 1.25.

Next, we look for respondents from the Junior group (B) whose Need_for_Technical_Support is lower than 1.25. Since the lowest possible score is 1, we look for respondents with a Need_for_Technical_Support of 1.

The respondents from the Junior group with Need_for_Technical_Support = 1 are:
- Respondent 36
- Respondent 32
- Respondent 14

Now, we need to find the Inconsistency for these respondents:
- Respondent 36 has Inconsistency = 1
- Respondent 32 has Inconsistency = 1
- Respondent 14 has Inconsistency = 1

All the respondents from the Junior group with a Need_for_Technical_Support lower than the average for the Intern group have an Inconsistency of 1, which corresponds to ""Strongly Disagree"" according to the schema. However, the task asks for the human-readable value of the Inconsistency score directly, not the corresponding text from the schema. Therefore, the answer should reflect the score itself as it directly answers the question about the level of inconsistency experienced by the respondents in question.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the Confidence_in_Use of the respondent from the Senior group with the highest Inconsistency score?
</task>","To find the Confidence_in_Use of the respondent from the Senior group with the highest Inconsistency score, we first need to identify all respondents from the Senior group and then find the one with the highest Inconsistency score.

From the 'questions' section, we understand that the ""Group"" question is a multiple-choice question with options A. Senior, B. Junior, C. Middle, D. Intern. We are interested in respondents who answered ""A"" (which corresponds to ""Senior"").

Looking through the 'responses' section, we find respondents who belong to the Senior group by looking for answers to the ""Group"" question that are ""A"" (since ""A"" corresponds to ""Senior""). The respondents from the Senior group are:

- Respondent id=""86""
- Respondent id=""13""
- Respondent id=""59""

Now, we need to find the Inconsistency scores for these respondents. The question ""Inconsistency"" has the id ""Inconsistency"", and we look for the answers to this question for the identified Senior respondents:

- Respondent id=""86"" answered ""3"" to the Inconsistency question.
- Respondent id=""13"" answered ""1"" to the Inconsistency question.
- Respondent id=""59"" answered ""1"" to the Inconsistency question.

Among these, respondent id=""86"" has the highest Inconsistency score with a value of ""3"".

Finally, we need to find the Confidence_in_Use for respondent id=""86"". The Confidence_in_Use question has the id ""Confidence_in_Use"". For respondent id=""86"", the answer to the Confidence_in_Use question is ""4"".

Since the Confidence_in_Use question is a Likert scale from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree) for the statement ""I felt very confident using the system"", a score of ""4"" means the respondent somewhat agrees with the statement, but since the output should be based on the provided scale, we directly map this to the corresponding level of agreement.

The final answer is: 4",True

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the Need_to_Learn_Before_Use of the respondent whose combined score for Confidence_in_Use and Ease_of_Learning was exactly 10?
</task>","To find the respondent whose combined score for Confidence_in_Use and Ease_of_Learning was exactly 10, we need to examine each respondent's answers for these two questions and then find the Need_to_Learn_Before_Use score for the respondent(s) that meet this criterion.

From the provided data:

1. Respondent 53: Confidence_in_Use = 5, Ease_of_Learning = 5. Combined score = 10.
2. Respondent 67: Confidence_in_Use = 5, Ease_of_Learning = 5. Combined score = 10.
3. Respondent 70: Confidence_in_Use = 5, Ease_of_Learning = 5. Combined score = 10.
4. Respondent 90: Confidence_in_Use = 5, Ease_of_Learning = 5. Combined score = 10.
5. Respondent 15: Confidence_in_Use = 4, Ease_of_Learning = 4. Combined score = 8.
6. Respondent 23: Confidence_in_Use = 2, Ease_of_Learning = 4. Combined score = 6.
7. Respondent 49: Confidence_in_Use = 4, Ease_of_Learning = 4. Combined score = 8.
8. Respondent 29: Confidence_in_Use = 4, Ease_of_Learning = 5. Combined score = 9.

Respondents 53, 67, 70, and 90 have a combined score of exactly 10 for Confidence_in_Use and Ease_of_Learning. We now need to find their Need_to_Learn_Before_Use scores:

1. Respondent 53: Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = 1.
2. Respondent 67: Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = 1.
3. Respondent 70: Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = 1.
4. Respondent 90: Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = 1.

All respondents with a combined score of 10 for Confidence_in_Use and Ease_of_Learning have the same Need_to_Learn_Before_Use score, which is 1. According to the schema, this score corresponds to ""Strongly Disagree"" since the scale is 1–5, where 1 = Strongly Disagree. However, the task asks for the output as per the given rules, which for Likert scale questions like this would typically mean providing the numerical value as it directly corresponds to the level of agreement/disagreement without converting it into text. 

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
What is the Group of the respondent from the Senior group who rated Cumbersome_to_Use as 1 and Need_for_Technical_Support as 5?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to find the respondent who belongs to the Senior group, rated Cumbersome_to_Use as 1, and rated Need_for_Technical_Support as 5.

From the 'questions' section, we know that the Senior group corresponds to option A.

Looking at the 'responses' section, we can see that respondent '11' and respondent '35' are from the Senior group (Group A). However, only respondent '11' rated Cumbersome_to_Use as 1 and Need_for_Technical_Support as 5.

Therefore, the Group of the respondent from the Senior group who rated Cumbersome_to_Use as 1 and Need_for_Technical_Support as 5 is Senior.

The final answer is: Senior",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

What is the Cumbersome_to_Use of the respondent from the Senior group who rated Confidence_in_Use as 5 and Integration_of_Functions as 5?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to find the respondent from the Senior group who rated Confidence_in_Use as 5 and Integration_of_Functions as 5, and then determine their rating for Cumbersome_to_Use.

From the 'questions' section, we know that the ""Group"" question is a multiple-choice question with options A. Senior, B. Junior, C. Middle, and D. Intern. We are looking for a respondent from the Senior group, which corresponds to option A.

We search through the 'responses' section to find a respondent who meets the specified criteria:

1. Group: A (Senior)
2. Confidence_in_Use: 5
3. Integration_of_Functions: 5

After examining the responses, we find that respondents 6 and 67 match these criteria:

- Respondent 6: 
  - Group: A
  - Confidence_in_Use: 5
  - Integration_of_Functions: 5
  - Cumbersome_to_Use: 1

- Respondent 67: 
  - Group: A
  - Confidence_in_Use: 5
  - Integration_of_Functions: 5
  - Cumbersome_to_Use: 1

Both respondents 6 and 67 are from the Senior group, rated Confidence_in_Use as 5, and Integration_of_Functions as 5. Their ratings for Cumbersome_to_Use are both 1, which according to the schema means ""Strongly Disagree"" that the system is very awkward to use.

The final answer is: Strongly Disagree",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the Need_to_Learn_Before_Use of the respondent from the Senior group whose Integration_of_Functions is lower than the average Integration_of_Functions for the Intern group in this case?
</task>","To solve this, we first need to calculate the average Integration_of_Functions for the Intern group, then find the Senior group respondents with Integration_of_Functions lower than this average, and finally determine their Need_to_Learn_Before_Use.

1. **Calculate the average Integration_of_Functions for the Intern group:**

Intern respondents are those with Group = D. From the data:
- Respondent 71: Integration_of_Functions = 4
- Respondent 74: Integration_of_Functions = 5

Average Integration_of_Functions for Interns = (4 + 5) / 2 = 4.5

2. **Find Senior group respondents with Integration_of_Functions lower than 4.5:**

Senior respondents are those with Group = A. From the data:
- Respondent 46: Integration_of_Functions = 1
- Respondent 56: Integration_of_Functions = 5
- Respondent 59: Integration_of_Functions = 5
- Respondent 44 is not a Senior, but a Junior (B).
- Respondent 33 is not a Senior, but a Middle (C).

Only Respondent 46 has an Integration_of_Functions (1) lower than the average for Interns (4.5).

3. **Determine the Need_to_Learn_Before_Use for this respondent:**

For Respondent 46, Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = 1

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
What is the Inconsistency of the respondent from the Middle group whose System_Complexity is higher than the average System_Complexity for the Intern group in this case?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the average System_Complexity for the Intern group.
2. Identify respondents from the Middle group whose System_Complexity is higher than this average.
3. Determine the Inconsistency for these respondents.

**Step 1: Calculate the average System_Complexity for the Intern group.**

Intern group respondents are those with ""Group"" answer as ""D"". From the data:

- Respondent 71: System_Complexity = 1
- Respondent 41: System_Complexity = 1
- Respondent 25: System_Complexity = 3

Average System_Complexity for Intern group = (1 + 1 + 3) / 3 = 5 / 3 = 1.67

**Step 2: Identify respondents from the Middle group whose System_Complexity is higher than this average.**

Middle group respondents are those with ""Group"" answer as ""C"". From the data:

- Respondent 17: System_Complexity = 1 (not higher than 1.67)
- Respondent 39: System_Complexity = 4 (higher than 1.67)

**Step 3: Determine the Inconsistency for these respondents.**

For Respondent 39, Inconsistency = 4

Since there's only one respondent from the Middle group with a System_Complexity higher than the average for the Intern group, the answer is based on this single respondent.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

What is the Inconsistency of the respondent from the Middle group who rated Integration_of_Functions as 5 and Inconsistency as 1?
</task>","To find the Inconsistency of the respondent from the Middle group who rated Integration_of_Functions as 5 and Inconsistency as 1, we first need to identify the respondent who matches these criteria.

From the 'questions' section, we understand that:
- The ""Group"" question has options A. Senior, B. Junior, C. Middle, D. Intern.
- The ""Integration_of_Functions"" and ""Inconsistency"" questions are rated on a Likert scale of 1-5.

Looking through the 'responses' section for a respondent in the Middle group (C) who rated Integration_of_Functions as 5 and Inconsistency as 1, we find:

Respondent id=""53"" matches our criteria because they are in the Middle group (C), rated Integration_of_Functions as 5, and rated Inconsistency as 1.

Therefore, the Inconsistency of this respondent is ""Strongly Disagree"" since they rated Inconsistency as 1, according to the Likert scale provided in the schema.

The final answer is: Strongly Disagree",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
What is the Integration_of_Functions of the respondent from the Intern group with the lowest Ease_of_Use score?
</task>","To answer this question, we first need to identify the respondents from the Intern group, then find the one with the lowest Ease_of_Use score, and finally determine their Integration_of_Functions score.

From the 'questions' section, we understand that the Intern group is represented by the letter 'D' in the ""Group"" question.

Looking through the 'responses' section for respondents with the answer ""D"" for the ""Group"" question, we find:

- Respondent id=""64"" with ""Group"" answer=""D"", ""Ease_of_Use"" score=2, and ""Integration_of_Functions"" score=2.

There are no other respondents from the Intern group, so respondent id=""64"" is the one we are looking for.

The Integration_of_Functions score for this respondent is 2, which according to the schema means they somewhat disagree that the various functions in the system were well integrated. However, since the question asks for the score as per the human-readable value and given the scale is from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree), the score itself is what we need to focus on for the direct answer, but since the output rules specify providing the human-readable value for MCQ fields and this is a Likert scale, the direct score is the answer.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$",True
