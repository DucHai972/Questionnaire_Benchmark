<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who are in the 'Middle' group.
</task>","To determine the count of respondents in the 'Middle' group, we need to look at the 'Group' field in each respondent's data and identify those marked as 'C', since according to the schema, 'C' corresponds to 'Middle'.

From the provided data:

- Respondent 22: **Group:** C
- Respondent 40: **Group:** C

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents from the 'Junior' group who rated 'Ease_of_Learning' as 5.
</task>","To answer this question, we first need to identify the respondents who belong to the 'Junior' group and then check their ratings for 'Ease_of_Learning' to see if any of them rated it as 5.

From the 'questions' section, we understand that the 'Group' is categorized as follows: A. Senior, B. Junior, C. Middle, D. Intern. Therefore, respondents belonging to the 'Junior' group will have 'B' marked under the 'Group' category in the 'responses' section.

Next, we look through the responses to find individuals who are in the 'Junior' group (marked as 'B') and see if any of them have rated 'Ease_of_Learning' as 5.

Respondent 66 and Respondent 61 are in the 'Junior' group. 

- Respondent 66 rated 'Ease_of_Learning' as 5.
- Respondent 61 rated 'Ease_of_Learning' as 2.

Therefore, there is only 1 respondent from the 'Junior' group who rated 'Ease_of_Learning' as 5.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the respondents from the 'Middle' group who rated 'Ease_of_Use' as 3.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to identify the respondents who belong to the 'Middle' group and then check their ratings for 'Ease_of_Use' to find those who rated it as 3.

From the 'questions' section, we understand that the 'Group' is categorized as follows: A. Senior, B. Junior, C. Middle, D. Intern. Therefore, respondents belonging to the 'Middle' group are those whose 'Group' response is 'C'.

Next, we look through the 'responses' to find respondents with 'Group' as 'C' and 'Ease_of_Use' as 3.

Respondent 87 has 'Group' as 'C' (Middle) and 'Ease_of_Use' as 3.

No other respondent fits this criterion.

Therefore, the count of respondents from the 'Middle' group who rated 'Ease_of_Use' as 3 is 1.",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents from the 'Junior' group who rated 'Cumbersome_to_Use' as 4.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify respondents in the 'Junior' group.
2. Among those, find respondents who rated 'Cumbersome_to_Use' as 4.

From the 'questions' section, we know 'Junior' corresponds to option B.

Now, let's examine the responses:

### Respondent 18
- **Group:** D (Not Junior)

### Respondent 32
- **Group:** B (Junior)
- **Cumbersome_to_Use:** 1 (Not 4)

### Respondent 4
- **Group:** C (Not Junior)

### Respondent 79
- **Group:** B (Junior)
- **Cumbersome_to_Use:** 1 (Not 4)

### Respondent 58
- **Group:** A (Not Junior)

### Respondent 24
- **Group:** C (Not Junior)

### Respondent 90
- **Group:** D (Not Junior)

### Respondent 16
- **Group:** B (Junior)
- **Cumbersome_to_Use:** 1 (Not 4)

### Respondent 84
- **Group:** D (Not Junior)

### Respondent 45
- **Group:** D (Not Junior)

### Respondent 11
- **Group:** A (Not Junior)

### Respondent 30
- **Group:** D (Not Junior)

Only Respondent 24 is not in the 'Junior' group but has a 'Cumbersome_to_Use' rating. However, they are in the 'Middle' group, not 'Junior'. 

Upon reviewing, none of the respondents in the 'Junior' group rated 'Cumbersome_to_Use' as 4.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who are in the 'Senior' group.
</task>","To determine the count of respondents in the 'Senior' group, we first need to identify which group label corresponds to 'Senior' in the provided schema. According to the schema, the groups are labeled as follows: A. Senior, B. Junior, C. Middle, D. Intern. Thus, 'Senior' corresponds to option A.

Next, we go through the responses and count how many respondents have selected 'A' as their group.

- Respondent 38: A
- Respondent 11: A
- Respondent 76: A
- Respondent 55: A
- Respondent 46: A

<task>
Count the respondents whose combined score for 'Ease_of_Use' and 'System_Complexity' is less than 6.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to examine each respondent's scores for 'Ease_of_Use' and 'System_Complexity', add these two scores together, and then count how many respondents have a combined score of less than 6.

Let's calculate the combined scores:

### Respondent 26
- **Ease_of_Use:** 4
- **System_Complexity:** 2
- Combined score: 4 + 2 = 6

### Respondent 85
- **Ease_of_Use:** 5
- **System_Complexity:** 1
- Combined score: 5 + 1 = 6

### Respondent 27
- **Ease_of_Use:** 2
- **System_Complexity:** 4
- Combined score: 2 + 4 = 6

### Respondent 56
- **Ease_of_Use:** 4
- **System_Complexity:** 2
- Combined score: 4 + 2 = 6

### Respondent 77
- **Ease_of_Use:** 5
- **System_Complexity:** 1
- Combined score: 5 + 1 = 6

From the calculations, we see that all respondents have a combined score of exactly 6, and none have a combined score of less than 6.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the respondents whose combined score for 'Frequent_Usage' and 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' is less than 5.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to go through each respondent's data, calculate the combined score for 'Frequent_Usage' and 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use', and then count how many of these combined scores are less than 5.

1. Respondent 15: 'Frequent_Usage' = 2, 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 2. Combined score = 2 + 2 = 4. This is less than 5.
2. Respondent 17: 'Frequent_Usage' = 5, 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 1. Combined score = 5 + 1 = 6. This is not less than 5.
3. Respondent 70: 'Frequent_Usage' = 5, 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 1. Combined score = 5 + 1 = 6. This is not less than 5.
4. Respondent 77: 'Frequent_Usage' = 5, 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 1. Combined score = 5 + 1 = 6. This is not less than 5.
5. Respondent 23: 'Frequent_Usage' = 4, 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 3. Combined score = 4 + 3 = 7. This is not less than 5.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the respondents from the 'Middle' group who rated 'System_Complexity' as 3 and 'Inconsistency' as 1.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to identify respondents who belong to the 'Middle' group, and within that group, find those who rated 'System_Complexity' as 3 and 'Inconsistency' as 1.

From the 'questions' section, we understand that the 'Group' is categorized as follows: A. Senior, B. Junior, C. Middle, D. Intern. Therefore, respondents belonging to the 'Middle' group are those with 'Group' coded as 'C'.

We then need to look through the 'responses' to find individuals who meet both criteria: 
1. Their 'Group' is 'C' (Middle).
2. Their 'System_Complexity' rating is 3.
3. Their 'Inconsistency' rating is 1.

Let's examine the responses:

- Respondent 2: Group = C, System_Complexity = 1, Inconsistency = 1 (Does not meet the System_Complexity criterion)
- Respondent 61: Group = B (Does not meet the Group criterion)
- Respondent 15: Group = D (Does not meet the Group criterion)
- Respondent 51: Group = C, System_Complexity = 1, Inconsistency = 1 (Does not meet the System_Complexity criterion)
- Respondent 19: Group = C, System_Complexity = 1, Inconsistency = 1 (Does not meet the System_Complexity criterion)
- Respondent 88: Group = C, System_Complexity = 2, Inconsistency = 3 (Does not meet either criterion)
- Respondent 6: Group = A (Does not meet the Group criterion)
- Respondent 18: Group = D (Does not meet the Group criterion)
- Respondent 69: Group = B (Does not meet the Group criterion)

Upon reviewing the provided responses, there is no respondent who meets all the specified criteria (being in the 'Middle' group and rating 'System_Complexity' as 3 and 'Inconsistency' as 1).

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the respondents who have a total positive usability score ('Ease_of_Use' + 'Integration_of_Functions') that is lower than the average for all respondents not in their group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average total positive usability score for each group, excluding the respondents in the 'Intern' group (since we're comparing each respondent's score to the average of the other groups). The total positive usability score is the sum of 'Ease_of_Use' and 'Integration_of_Functions'.

Given the data, let's first identify the respondents in the 'Intern' group and calculate the average total positive usability score for the other groups.

Respondents in the 'Intern' group (Group D) are:
- Respondent 49
- Respondent 30
- Respondent 74
- Respondent 71

Now, let's calculate the total positive usability score for each respondent not in the 'Intern' group and then find the average for these groups.

### Respondents not in the 'Intern' group:

- Respondent 43 (Group C): Ease_of_Use = 5, Integration_of_Functions = 5, Total = 10
- Respondent 22 (Group C): Ease_of_Use = 4, Integration_of_Functions = 4, Total = 8
- Respondent 50 (Group C): Ease_of_Use = 5, Integration_of_Functions = 5, Total = 10
- Respondent 89 (Group A): Ease_of_Use = 3, Integration_of_Functions = 5, Total = 8
- Respondent 37 (Group C): Ease_of_Use = 5, Integration_of_Functions = 5, Total = 10
- Respondent 36 (Group B): Ease_of_Use = 5, Integration_of_Functions = 5, Total = 10

Total scores for non-Intern groups: 10 + 8 + 10 + 8 + 10 + 10 = 56

Number of respondents not in the 'Intern' group: 6

Average total positive usability score for non-Intern groups: 56 / 6 = 9.33

Now, let's calculate the total positive usability score for each respondent in the 'Intern' group and compare it to the average calculated above.

- Respondent 49: Ease_of_Use = 5, Integration_of_Functions = 5, Total = 10
- Respondent 30: Ease_of_Use = 5, Integration_of_Functions = 5, Total = 10
- Respondent 74: Ease_of_Use = 5, Integration_of_Functions = 5, Total = 10
- Respondent 71: Ease_of_Use = 5, Integration_of_Functions = 4, Total = 9

Comparing these scores to the average of 9.33:
- Respondent 49: 10 >= 9.33, so not lower
- Respondent 30: 10 >= 9.33, so not lower
- Respondent 74: 10 >= 9.33, so not lower
- Respondent 71: 9 < 9.33, so lower

Only Respondent 71 has a total positive usability score lower than the average for all respondents not in their group.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$",True

<task>
Count the respondents who have a 'System_Complexity' score that is higher than the average 'System_Complexity' score for their group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'System_Complexity' score for each group and then compare each respondent's score to this average to determine if it's higher.

Given the data, let's calculate the average 'System_Complexity' score for each group:

1. **Group A (Senior):** There are no respondents in this group, so we cannot calculate an average.
2. **Group B (Junior):**
   - Respondent 36: 1
   - Respondent 32: 1
   - Respondent 14: 1
   - Average for Group B: (1 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 3 / 3 = 1
3. **Group C (Middle):**
   - Respondent 82: 1
   - Respondent 4: 1
   - Respondent 87: 2
   - Respondent 70: 1
   - Average for Group C: (1 + 1 + 2 + 1) / 4 = 5 / 4 = 1.25
4. **Group D (Intern):**
   - Respondent 15: 2
   - Respondent 29: 1
   - Respondent 18: 1
   - Respondent 12: 2
   - Average for Group D: (2 + 1 + 1 + 2) / 4 = 6 / 4 = 1.5

Now, let's identify respondents with a 'System_Complexity' score higher than their group's average:

- **Group B:** Since the average is 1, and all scores are 1, there are no respondents with a score higher than the average.
- **Group C:** The average is 1.25. Respondent 87 has a score of 2, which is higher than 1.25.
- **Group D:** The average is 1.5. Respondents 15 and 12 have scores of 2, which is higher than 1.5.

- Respondent 87 from Group C
- Respondent 15 from Group D
- Respondent 12 from Group D

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who have a total positive usability score ('Ease_of_Use' + 'Integration_of_Functions') that is lower than the average for all respondents not in their group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average total positive usability score for each group, excluding the respondents in the 'Intern' group (since the question implicitly asks for a comparison involving the 'Intern' group, but the provided example and the task description do not perfectly align, we'll proceed with the understanding that we compare each group's average score excluding the group itself).

Given the 'questions' section defines:
- **Ease_of_Use:** I thought the system was easy to use. [Likert 1–5: 1 = Strongly Disagree, 5 = Strongly Agree]
- **Integration_of_Functions:** I found the various functions in this system were well integrated. [Likert 1–5: 1 = Strongly Disagree, 5 = Strongly Agree]

And the groups are defined as:
- **Group:** Group of the respondent [MCQ: A. Senior B. Junior C. Middle D. Intern]

Let's calculate the total positive usability score for each respondent and then find the averages for each group, excluding the respondents in the 'Intern' group (D).

### Respondents and Their Scores

1. Respondent 5 (C): Ease_of_Use = 5, Integration_of_Functions = 5, Total = 10
2. Respondent 37 (C): Ease_of_Use = 5, Integration_of_Functions = 5, Total = 10
3. Respondent 90 (D): Ease_of_Use = 5, Integration_of_Functions = 5, Total = 10
4. Respondent 19 (C): Ease_of_Use = 5, Integration_of_Functions = 3, Total = 8
5. Respondent 60 (D): Ease_of_Use = 5, Integration_of_Functions = 4, Total = 9
6. Respondent 48 (D): Ease_of_Use = 5, Integration_of_Functions = 5, Total = 10
7. Respondent 86 (A): Ease_of_Use = 1, Integration_of_Functions = 5, Total = 6
8. Respondent 13 (A): Ease_of_Use = 5, Integration_of_Functions = 5, Total = 10
9. Respondent 59 (A): Ease_of_Use = 5, Integration_of_Functions = 5, Total = 10
10. Respondent 77 (D): Ease_of_Use = 5, Integration_of_Functions = 4, Total = 9
11. Respondent 64 (D): Ease_of_Use = 2, Integration_of_Functions = 2, Total = 4
12. Respondent 78 (D): Ease_of_Use = 3, Integration_of_Functions = 4, Total = 7

### Group Averages Excluding Own Group

- For Group A (excluding A): (10+10+10+10+9+9+10+9+4+7)/8 = 88/8 = 11
- For Group B (no respondents): N/A
- For Group C (excluding C): (10+10+10+9+10+9+4+7)/8 = 69/8 = 8.625
- For Group D (excluding D): (10+10+10+8+6+10+10)/7 = 64/7 = 9.143

### Counting Respondents with Lower Score Than Average of Other Groups

- Group A: Average of others = (88+69)/2 = 157/2 = 78.5, then 78.5/7 = 11.214. Respondents in A with score lower than 11.214: Respondent 86 (score = 6). Count = 1
- Group B: No respondents.
- Group C: Average of others = (88+64)/2 = 152/2 = 76, then 76/6 = 12.667. Respondents in C with score lower than 12.667: Respondent 19 (score = 8). Count = 1
- Group D: Average of others = (88+64)/2 = 152/2 = 76, then 76/7 = 10.857. Respondents in D with score lower than 10.857: Respondents 60 (score = 9), 77 (score = 9), 64 (score = 4), 78 (score = 7). Count = 4

### Final Answer

Count of respondents who have a total positive usability score lower than the average for all respondents not in their group = 1 (from A) + 1 (from C) + 4 (from D) = 6

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who have a 'Integration_of_Functions' score that is higher than the average 'Integration_of_Functions' score for their group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Integration_of_Functions' score for each group and then compare each respondent's score to this average to determine if it's higher.

Given the data:

- Respondent 53 (Group C): Integration_of_Functions = 5
- Respondent 67 (Group A): Integration_of_Functions = 5
- Respondent 70 (Group C): Integration_of_Functions = 5
- Respondent 90 (Group D): Integration_of_Functions = 5
- Respondent 15 (Group D): Integration_of_Functions = 5
- Respondent 23 (Group B): Integration_of_Functions = 4
- Respondent 49 (Group D): Integration_of_Functions = 5
- Respondent 29 (Group D): Integration_of_Functions = 4

Let's calculate the average 'Integration_of_Functions' score for each group:

- Group A: (5) / 1 = 5
- Group B: (4) / 1 = 4
- Group C: (5 + 5) / 2 = 5
- Group D: (5 + 5 + 5 + 4) / 4 = 4.75

Now, let's compare each respondent's 'Integration_of_Functions' score to their group's average:

- Respondent 53 (Group C): 5 == 5 (not higher)
- Respondent 67 (Group A): 5 == 5 (not higher)
- Respondent 70 (Group C): 5 == 5 (not higher)
- Respondent 90 (Group D): 5 > 4.75 (higher)
- Respondent 15 (Group D): 5 > 4.75 (higher)
- Respondent 23 (Group B): 4 == 4 (not higher)
- Respondent 49 (Group D): 5 > 4.75 (higher)
- Respondent 29 (Group D): 4 < 4.75 (not higher)

Counting the respondents with a score higher than their group's average:

- Respondent 90
- Respondent 15
- Respondent 49

There are 3 respondents whose 'Integration_of_Functions' score is higher than the average for their group.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who have a 'Confidence_in_Use' score that is higher than the average 'Confidence_in_Use' score for their group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Confidence_in_Use' score for each group and then compare each respondent's score to their group's average.

### Step 1: Calculate the average 'Confidence_in_Use' score for each group.

- Group A: Respondents 35 and 11. Scores are 1 and 3, respectively. Average = (1 + 3) / 2 = 2.
- Group B: Respondents 44 and 3. Scores are 1 and 5, respectively. Average = (1 + 5) / 2 = 3.
- Group C: Respondents 54, 63, 33, 39, and 62. Scores are 4, 5, 4, 4, and 5, respectively. Average = (4 + 5 + 4 + 4 + 5) / 5 = 4.4.
- Group D: Respondent 10. Score is 5. Average = 5.

### Step 2: Identify respondents with a 'Confidence_in_Use' score higher than their group's average.

- Group A: None, since both scores are at or below the average.
- Group B: Respondent 3, with a score of 5, which is higher than the group average of 3.
- Group C: Respondents 63 and 62, with scores of 5, which is higher than the group average of 4.4. Also, respondents 54 and 39 have scores of 4, which is below the average, and respondent 33 has a score of 4, which is also below the average. So, only respondents 63 and 62 meet the criteria.
- Group D: Since there's only one respondent, and the average is exactly their score, there's no one with a score higher than the average in this group.

### Step 3: Count the identified respondents.

From the analysis:
- Group B contributes 1 respondent (Respondent 3).
- Group C contributes 2 respondents (Respondents 63 and 62).

Total count = 1 (from Group B) + 2 (from Group C) = 3.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who have a 'Integration_of_Functions' score that is higher than the average 'Integration_of_Functions' score for their group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Integration_of_Functions' score for each group and then compare each respondent's score to this average to determine if it's higher.

Given the data:

1. **Respondent 10 (D)**: Integration_of_Functions = 5
2. **Respondent 52 (A)**: Integration_of_Functions = 4
3. **Respondent 6 (A)**: Integration_of_Functions = 5
4. **Respondent 76 (A)**: Integration_of_Functions = 4
5. **Respondent 30 (D)**: Integration_of_Functions = 5
6. **Respondent 82 (C)**: Integration_of_Functions = 4
7. **Respondent 67 (A)**: Integration_of_Functions = 5
8. **Respondent 20 (C)**: Integration_of_Functions = 4

Let's calculate the average 'Integration_of_Functions' score for each group:

- **Group A (Senior)**: (4 + 5 + 4 + 5) / 4 = 18 / 4 = 4.5
- **Group D (Intern)**: (5 + 5) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5
- **Group C (Middle)**: (4 + 4) / 2 = 8 / 2 = 4

Now, let's identify respondents whose 'Integration_of_Functions' score is higher than their group's average:

- **Group A**: Average = 4.5, Respondents with score > 4.5 are Respondent 6 and Respondent 67.
- **Group D**: Average = 5, No respondents have a score higher than 5.
- **Group C**: Average = 4, No respondents have a score higher than 4.

Counting these respondents gives us a total of 2 respondents (Respondent 6 and Respondent 67) who have an 'Integration_of_Functions' score higher than the average for their group.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$",True
case_47,respondent_count,Count the respondents in the 'Junior' group who have a 'Cumbersome_to_Use' score that is higher than the average 'Cumbersome_to_Use' for the 'Middle' group.,"# Survey Data

<task>
Count the respondents in the 'Junior' group who have a 'Cumbersome_to_Use' score that is higher than the average 'Cumbersome_to_Use' for the 'Middle' group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Cumbersome_to_Use' score for the 'Middle' group and then identify the respondents in the 'Junior' group who have a 'Cumbersome_to_Use' score higher than this average.

1. **Identify 'Middle' group respondents and their 'Cumbersome_to_Use' scores:**
   - Respondent 9: 'Middle' group, 'Cumbersome_to_Use' = 3
   - Respondent 33: 'Middle' group, 'Cumbersome_to_Use' = 1
   - Respondent 50: 'Middle' group, 'Cumbersome_to_Use' = 2
   - Respondent 51: 'Middle' group, 'Cumbersome_to_Use' = 1

2. **Calculate the average 'Cumbersome_to_Use' score for the 'Middle' group:**
   - Average = (3 + 1 + 2 + 1) / 4 = 7 / 4 = 1.75

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who have a 'Ease_of_Use' score that is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score for their group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Ease_of_Use' score for each group and then compare each respondent's score to this average to determine if it's higher.

### Step 1: Calculate Average 'Ease_of_Use' Score for Each Group

We'll start by grouping the respondents by their 'Group' and calculating the average 'Ease_of_Use' score for each group.

- **Group A (Senior):** Respondents 72 and 65.
  - Ease_of_Use scores: 5 (72), 5 (65)
  - Average = (5 + 5) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5
- **Group B (Junior):** Respondent 69.
  - Ease_of_Use score: 5
  - Average = 5
- **Group C (Middle):** Respondents 17 and 39.
  - Ease_of_Use scores: 5 (17), 1 (39)
  - Average = (5 + 1) / 2 = 6 / 2 = 3
- **Group D (Intern):** Respondents 71, 41, and 25.
  - Ease_of_Use scores: 5 (71), 5 (41), 3 (25)
  - Average = (5 + 5 + 3) / 3 = 13 / 3 = 4.33

### Step 2: Identify Respondents with 'Ease_of_Use' Score Higher Than Group Average

Now, we compare each respondent's 'Ease_of_Use' score to their group's average.

- **Group A (Senior):** Average is 5.
  - Respondent 72: 5 (not higher)
  - Respondent 65: 5 (not higher)
- **Group B (Junior):** Average is 5.
  - Respondent 69: 5 (not higher)
- **Group C (Middle):** Average is 3.
  - Respondent 17: 5 (higher)
  - Respondent 39: 1 (not higher)
- **Group D (Intern):** Average is 4.33.
  - Respondent 71: 5 (higher)
  - Respondent 41: 5 (higher)
  - Respondent 25: 3 (not higher)

### Step 3: Count Respondents with Higher Scores

Count the respondents identified in Step 2 as having a higher 'Ease_of_Use' score than their group's average.

- Respondent 17 (Group C)
- Respondent 71 (Group D)
- Respondent 41 (Group D)

Total count: 3

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who have a 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score that is higher than the average 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score for their group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score for each group and then compare each respondent's score to this average to determine if it's higher.

Given the data, let's calculate the average 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score for each group:

### Group A
- Respondent 42: 5
- Respondent 6: 1
Average for Group A = (5 + 1) / 2 = 3

### Group B
- Respondent 66: 1
- Respondent 36: 1
Average for Group B = (1 + 1) / 2 = 1

### Group C
- Respondent 9: 5
- Respondent 53: 1
- Respondent 88: 2
Average for Group C = (5 + 1 + 2) / 3 = 8 / 3 = 2.67

### Group D
- Respondent 45: 1
- Respondent 15: 1
- Respondent 71: 1
- Respondent 7: 1
Average for Group D = (1 + 1 + 1 + 1) / 4 = 4 / 4 = 1

Now, let's identify respondents with a 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score higher than their group's average:

### Group A
- Respondent 42: 5 (higher than 3)
- Respondent 6: 1 (not higher than 3)

### Group B
- Respondent 66: 1 (not higher than 1)
- Respondent 36: 1 (not higher than 1)

### Group C
- Respondent 9: 5 (higher than 2.67)
- Respondent 53: 1 (not higher than 2.67)
- Respondent 88: 2 (not higher than 2.67)

### Group D
- Respondent 45: 1 (not higher than 1)
- Respondent 15: 1 (not higher than 1)
- Respondent 71: 1 (not higher than 1)
- Respondent 7: 1 (not higher than 1)

Respondents with a score higher than their group's average are:
- Respondent 42 (Group A)
- Respondent 9 (Group C)

Count of such respondents = 2",True
case_50,respondent_count,Count the respondents who have a total positive usability score ('Ease_of_Use' + 'Integration_of_Functions') that is lower than the average for all respondents not in their group.,"# Survey Data

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who have a total positive usability score ('Ease_of_Use' + 'Integration_of_Functions') that is lower than the average for all respondents not in their group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average total positive usability score for each group, excluding the respondents in that group. Then, we compare each respondent's score to the average of the other groups to determine if it's lower.

1. **Calculate Total Positive Usability Score for Each Respondent:**
   - This score is the sum of 'Ease_of_Use' and 'Integration_of_Functions' for each respondent.

2. **Calculate Average Total Positive Usability Score for Each Group, Excluding Respondents in That Group:**
   - We need to calculate the average score for respondents not in each group (A, B, C, D) separately.

3. **Compare Each Respondent's Score to the Average of the Other Groups:**
   - If a respondent's score is lower than the average score of the groups they are not part of, we count them.

Let's start with calculating the total positive usability score for each respondent and then proceed with the averages and comparisons.

### Respondent Scores

- **Respondent 64 (D):** Ease_of_Use = 2, Integration_of_Functions = 2, Total = 4
- **Respondent 35 (A):** Ease_of_Use = 1, Integration_of_Functions = 1, Total = 2
- **Respondent 47 (B):** Ease_of_Use = 4, Integration_of_Functions = 5, Total = 9
- **Respondent 82 (C):** Ease_of_Use = 4, Integration_of_Functions = 4, Total = 8
- **Respondent 32 (B):** Ease_of_Use = 5, Integration_of_Functions = 5, Total = 10
- **Respondent 89 (A):** Ease_of_Use = 3, Integration_of_Functions = 5, Total = 8
- **Respondent 61 (B):** Ease_of_Use = 2, Integration_of_Functions = 1, Total = 3
- **Respondent 43 (C):** Ease_of_Use = 5, Integration_of_Functions = 5, Total = 10
- **Respondent 11 (A):** Ease_of_Use = 5, Integration_of_Functions = 5, Total = 10

### Group Averages Excluding Own Group

- **Average excluding Group A:** (Respondents not in A) = [(4+9+8+10+3+10)/6] = 44/6 = 7.33
- **Average excluding Group B:** (Respondents not in B) = [(2+8+8+10+10+10)/6] = 48/6 = 8
- **Average excluding Group C:** (Respondents not in C) = [(2+9+10+8+3+10)/6] = 42/6 = 7
- **Average excluding Group D:** (Respondents not in D) = [(2+9+8+10+3+10+8+10)/8] = 60/8 = 7.5

### Comparison

- **Respondent 64 (D):** Score = 4, Average of other groups = 7.5, **Lower**
- **Respondent 35 (A):** Score = 2, Average of other groups = 8, **Lower**
- **Respondent 47 (B):** Score = 9, Average of other groups = 7, **Not Lower**
- **Respondent 82 (C):** Score = 8, Average of other groups = 7.33, **Not Lower**
- **Respondent 32 (B):** Score = 10, Average of other groups = 7, **Not Lower**
- **Respondent 89 (A):** Score = 8, Average of other groups = 8, **Not Lower**
- **Respondent 61 (B):** Score = 3, Average of other groups = 7, **Lower**
- **Respondent 43 (C):** Score = 10, Average of other groups = 7.5, **Not Lower**
- **Respondent 11 (A):** Score = 10, Average of other groups = 8, **Not Lower**

### Count of Respondents with Lower Score

- **Respondents with a lower score than the average of the other groups:** 3 (Respondent 64, Respondent 35, Respondent 61)

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$",True
