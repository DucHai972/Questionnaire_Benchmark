</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who are in the 'Middle' group.
</task>","To determine the count of respondents in the 'Middle' group, we first need to identify the corresponding code for 'Middle' from the questions schema. According to the schema, the question about the group of the respondent is coded as follows: ""[MCQ: A. Senior B. Junior C. Middle D. Intern]"". This means 'Middle' corresponds to code ""C"".

Next, we examine the responses to find individuals who belong to the 'Middle' group, which means looking for respondents with ""C"" as their group code.

From the provided responses:
- Respondent22 has a group code of ""C"".
- Respondent40 has a group code of ""C"".
- Respondent33 has a group code of ""C"".

Therefore, there are 3 respondents who are in the 'Middle' group. 

The final answer is: 3",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents from the 'Junior' group who rated 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' as 1.
</task>","To answer this question, we first need to identify the respondents who belong to the 'Junior' group and then check their ratings for 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use'.

From the 'questions' section, we understand that the group options are given as ""[MCQ: A. Senior B. Junior C. Middle D. Intern]"". This means 'Junior' corresponds to option 'B'.

Next, we examine the 'responses' section to find respondents who are in the 'Junior' group (those with pred:Group ""B"") and who rated 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' as ""1"".

Looking through the responses:
- Respondent14 is in the 'Junior' group (pred:Group ""B"") and rated 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' as ""3"", which does not match our criteria.
- No other respondents are in the 'Junior' group.

Therefore, the count of respondents from the 'Junior' group who rated 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' as 1 is 0.",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</task>","To answer this question, we first need to identify the respondents who are in the 'Intern' group and then check their ratings for 'Inconsistency'.

From the 'questions' section, we understand that the 'Intern' group is represented by the letter ""D"" in the MCQ for :QGroup.

We then look at the 'responses' section to find respondents with ""D"" as their group and check their 'Inconsistency' ratings.

Respondents with 'Group' ""D"" are:
- Respondent30

Now, we check their 'Inconsistency' ratings:
- Respondent30: 1
- Respondent48: 1
- Respondent49: 4

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<task>
Count the respondents from the 'Junior' group who rated 'Ease_of_Learning' as 5.
</task>","To answer this question, we first need to identify the respondents who belong to the 'Junior' group and then check their ratings for 'Ease_of_Learning'.

From the 'questions' section, we understand that the group options are:
- A. Senior
- B. Junior
- C. Middle
- D. Intern

So, respondents with 'Group' as ""B"" belong to the 'Junior' group.

Next, we look at the 'responses' section to find respondents with 'Group' as ""B"" and 'Ease_of_Learning' as ""5"".

Respondents with 'Group' as ""B"" are:
- Respondent66
- Respondent61

Now, checking their 'Ease_of_Learning' ratings:
- Respondent66 has 'Ease_of_Learning' as ""5"".
- Respondent61 has 'Ease_of_Learning' as ""2"".

Therefore, only Respondent66 meets the criteria.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents from the 'Junior' group who rated 'Cumbersome_to_Use' as 4.
</task>","To answer this question, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the respondents who belong to the 'Junior' group.
2. Among those, count the ones who rated 'Cumbersome_to_Use' as 4.

From the 'questions' section, we know that the group options are:
- A. Senior
- B. Junior
- C. Middle
- D. Intern

So, respondents who are in the 'Junior' group have ""B"" as their group code.

Now, let's examine the 'responses' section to find respondents with ""B"" as their group code and who rated 'Cumbersome_to_Use' as 4.

Respondents with group code ""B"" are:
- Respondent32
- Respondent79
- Respondent16

Among these, we need to find the ones who rated 'Cumbersome_to_Use' as 4:
- Respondent32 rated 'Cumbersome_to_Use' as 1.
- Respondent79 rated 'Cumbersome_to_Use' as 1.
- Respondent16 rated 'Cumbersome_to_Use' as 1.

None of the respondents from the 'Junior' group rated 'Cumbersome_to_Use' as 4.

Therefore, the count of respondents from the 'Junior' group who rated 'Cumbersome_to_Use' as 4 is 0.",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose combined score for 'Frequent_Usage' and 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' is less than 5.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to examine each respondent's scores for 'Frequent_Usage' and 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use', add these scores together, and then count how many respondents have a combined score less than 5.

Let's calculate the combined scores:

1. Respondent15: Frequent_Usage = 2, Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = 2, Combined = 4
2. Respondent17: Frequent_Usage = 5, Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = 1, Combined = 6
3. Respondent70: Frequent_Usage = 5, Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = 1, Combined = 6
4. Respondent77: Frequent_Usage = 5, Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = 1, Combined = 6
5. Respondent23: Frequent_Usage = 4, Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = 3, Combined = 7
6. Respondent29: Frequent_Usage = 4, Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = 1, Combined = 5
7. Respondent82: Frequent_Usage = 1, Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = 5, Combined = 6
8. Respondent60: Frequent_Usage = 1, Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = 2, Combined = 3

Now, let's count the respondents with a combined score less than 5:
- Respondent15 has a combined score of 4.
- Respondent60 has a combined score of 3.

Therefore, there are 2 respondents whose combined score for 'Frequent_Usage' and 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' is less than 5.",True
case_29,respondent_count,Count the respondents who rated 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' and 'Inconsistency' with the same score.,"@prefix : <http://example.org/survey#> .

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who rated 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' and 'Inconsistency' with the same score.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to examine each respondent's answers for 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' and 'Inconsistency' and count those where the scores match.

From the provided data:

1. **Respondent71**: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = ""1"", 'Inconsistency' = ""2"". Scores do not match.
2. **Respondent10**: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = ""2"", 'Inconsistency' = ""1"". Scores do not match.
3. **Respondent45**: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = ""1"", 'Inconsistency' = ""1"". Scores match.
4. **Respondent77**: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = ""1"", 'Inconsistency' = ""1"". Scores match.
5. **Respondent78**: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = ""5"", 'Inconsistency' = ""4"". Scores do not match.
6. **Respondent37**: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = ""1"", 'Inconsistency' = ""1"". Scores match.
7. **Respondent12**: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = ""2"", 'Inconsistency' = ""2"". Scores match.
8. **Respondent66**: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = ""2"", 'Inconsistency' = ""2"". Scores match.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose combined score for 'Frequent_Usage' and 'System_Complexity' is less than 8.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to calculate the combined score for 'Frequent_Usage' and 'System_Complexity' for each respondent and then count the number of respondents whose combined score is less than 8.

From the 'questions' section, we understand that both 'Frequent_Usage' and 'System_Complexity' are scored on a Likert scale of 1-5.

Let's calculate the combined scores:

1. Respondent10: Frequent_Usage = 5, System_Complexity = 1, Combined = 5 + 1 = 6
2. Respondent28: Frequent_Usage = 5, System_Complexity = 1, Combined = 5 + 1 = 6
3. Respondent19: Frequent_Usage = 1, System_Complexity = 1, Combined = 1 + 1 = 2
4. Respondent39: Frequent_Usage = 2, System_Complexity = 4, Combined = 2 + 4 = 6
5. Respondent90: Frequent_Usage = 5, System_Complexity = 1, Combined = 5 + 1 = 6
6. Respondent31: Frequent_Usage = 2, System_Complexity = 1, Combined = 2 + 1 = 3
7. Respondent64: Frequent_Usage = 1, System_Complexity = 3, Combined = 1 + 3 = 4
8. Respondent4: Frequent_Usage = 4, System_Complexity = 1, Combined = 4 + 1 = 5
9. Respondent5: Frequent_Usage = 5, System_Complexity = 1, Combined = 5 + 1 = 6

Now, let's count the respondents whose combined score is less than 8:

- Respondent10: 6 (less than 8)
- Respondent28: 6 (less than 8)
- Respondent19: 2 (less than 8)
- Respondent39: 6 (less than 8)
- Respondent90: 6 (less than 8)
- Respondent31: 3 (less than 8)
- Respondent64: 4 (less than 8)
- Respondent4: 5 (less than 8)
- Respondent5: 6 (less than 8)

All respondents have a combined score less than 8.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose combined score for 'Cumbersome_to_Use' and 'System_Complexity' is less than 4.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to examine each respondent's scores for 'Cumbersome_to_Use' and 'System_Complexity', add these scores together, and then count how many respondents have a combined score of less than 4.

Let's calculate the combined scores:

1. Respondent74: Cumbersome_to_Use = 1, System_Complexity = 1, Combined = 2
2. Respondent22: Cumbersome_to_Use = 2, System_Complexity = 2, Combined = 4
3. Respondent81: Cumbersome_to_Use = 2, System_Complexity = 1, Combined = 3
4. Respondent30: Cumbersome_to_Use = 1, System_Complexity = 1, Combined = 2
5. Respondent36: Cumbersome_to_Use = 1, System_Complexity = 1, Combined = 2
6. Respondent62: Cumbersome_to_Use = 1, System_Complexity = 1, Combined = 2
7. Respondent84: Cumbersome_to_Use = 4, System_Complexity = 3, Combined = 7
8. Respondent69: Cumbersome_to_Use = 1, System_Complexity = 4, Combined = 5

Now, let's count the respondents with a combined score of less than 4:

- Respondent74: 2
- Respondent81: 3
- Respondent30: 2
- Respondent36: 2
- Respondent62: 2

These 5 respondents have a combined score of less than 4.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents from the 'Junior' group who rated 'Cumbersome_to_Use' as 1 and 'System_Complexity' as 1.
</task>","To answer this question, we first need to identify the respondents who belong to the 'Junior' group, then check their ratings for 'Cumbersome_to_Use' and 'System_Complexity'.

From the 'questions' section, we understand that the group options are:
- A. Senior
- B. Junior
- C. Middle
- D. Intern

So, respondents with 'Group' as ""B"" are from the 'Junior' group.

Next, we look at the 'responses' section to find respondents who are in the 'Junior' group (""B""), and who rated 'Cumbersome_to_Use' as ""1"" and 'System_Complexity' as ""1"".

Respondents in the 'Junior' group are:
- Respondent44
- Respondent8
- Respondent68
- Respondent36

Checking their ratings:
- Respondent44: 'Cumbersome_to_Use' is ""1"" and 'System_Complexity' is ""2"", so this respondent does not meet the criteria.
- Respondent8: 'Cumbersome_to_Use' is ""4"" and 'System_Complexity' is ""1"", so this respondent does not meet the criteria.
- Respondent68: 'Cumbersome_to_Use' is ""1"" and 'System_Complexity' is ""3"", so this respondent does not meet the criteria.
- Respondent36: 'Cumbersome_to_Use' is ""1"" and 'System_Complexity' is ""1"", so this respondent meets the criteria.

Therefore, there is 1 respondent from the 'Junior' group who rated 'Cumbersome_to_Use' as 1 and 'System_Complexity' as 1.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who rated 'Ease_of_Learning' and 'Inconsistency' with the same score.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to examine each respondent's answers for 'Ease_of_Learning' and 'Inconsistency' and count those where the scores match.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who rated 'Inconsistency' and 'Ease_of_Use' with the same score.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to examine each respondent's answers for 'Inconsistency' and 'Ease_of_Use' and count those where the scores match.

From the 'responses' section:

1. **Respondent88**: Inconsistency = ""3"", Ease_of_Use = ""5"" (do not match)
2. **Respondent78**: Inconsistency = ""4"", Ease_of_Use = ""3"" (do not match)
3. **Respondent12**: Inconsistency = ""2"", Ease_of_Use = ""5"" (do not match)
4. **Respondent80**: Inconsistency = ""1"", Ease_of_Use = ""5"" (do not match)

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who rated 'Integration_of_Functions' and 'Inconsistency' with the same score.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to examine each respondent's answers for 'Integration_of_Functions' and 'Inconsistency' and count those where the scores match.

From the provided data:

1. Respondent82: Integration_of_Functions = 4, Inconsistency = 1 (do not match)
2. Respondent54: Integration_of_Functions = 5, Inconsistency = 1 (do not match)
3. Respondent55: Integration_of_Functions = 3, Inconsistency = 1 (do not match)
4. Respondent14: Integration_of_Functions = 3, Inconsistency = 1 (do not match)

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who rated 'Frequent_Usage' and 'System_Complexity' with the same score.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to examine each respondent's answers for 'Frequent_Usage' and 'System_Complexity' and count how many of them have the same score for both.

From the provided data:

1. **Respondent27**: Frequent_Usage = ""1"", System_Complexity = ""4"" (Different scores)
2. **Respondent34**: Frequent_Usage = ""1"", System_Complexity = ""4"" (Different scores)
3. **Respondent50**: Frequent_Usage = ""1"", System_Complexity = ""1"" (Same score)
4. **Respondent4**: Frequent_Usage = ""4"", System_Complexity = ""1"" (Different scores)
5. **Respondent25**: Frequent_Usage = ""3"", System_Complexity = ""3"" (Same score)
6. **Respondent29**: Frequent_Usage = ""4"", System_Complexity = ""1"" (Different scores)
7. **Respondent51**: Frequent_Usage = ""4"", System_Complexity = ""1"" (Different scores)
8. **Respondent73**: Frequent_Usage = ""1"", System_Complexity = ""1"" (Same score)
9. **Respondent1**: Frequent_Usage = ""3"", System_Complexity = ""1"" (Different scores)

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who rated 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' and 'Integration_of_Functions' with the same score.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to examine each respondent's answers for 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' and 'Integration_of_Functions' and count how many of them have the same score for both questions.

From the provided data:

1. **Respondent59**: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = ""1"", 'Integration_of_Functions' = ""5"". Scores are different.
2. **Respondent75**: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = ""5"", 'Integration_of_Functions' = ""2"". Scores are different.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who have a total positive usability score ('Ease_of_Use' + 'Integration_of_Functions') that is lower than the average for all respondents not in their group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average total positive usability score for each group, excluding the respondents in that group. Then, we compare each respondent's score to the average of the other groups to determine if it's lower.

1. **Calculate Total Positive Usability Score for Each Respondent:**
   - This score is the sum of 'Ease_of_Use' and 'Integration_of_Functions' for each respondent.

2. **Calculate Average Total Positive Usability Score for Each Group, Excluding Respondents in That Group:**
   - For each group (A, B, C, D), calculate the average total positive usability score of all respondents not in that group.

3. **Compare Each Respondent's Score to the Average of the Other Groups:**
   - For each respondent, check if their total positive usability score is lower than the average score of the respondents not in their group.

Let's calculate:

### Step 1: Calculate Total Positive Usability Score for Each Respondent

| Respondent | Group | Ease_of_Use | Integration_of_Functions | Total Score |
|------------|-------|-------------|--------------------------|-------------|
| Respondent49 | D     | 5           | 5                        | 10          |
| Respondent43 | C     | 5           | 5                        | 10          |
| Respondent30 | D     | 5           | 5                        | 10          |
| Respondent22 | C     | 4           | 4                        | 8           |
| Respondent50 | C     | 5           | 5                        | 10          |
| Respondent74 | D     | 5           | 5                        | 10          |
| Respondent89 | A     | 3           | 5                        | 8           |
| Respondent37 | C     | 5           | 5                        | 10          |
| Respondent71 | D     | 5           | 4                        | 9           |
| Respondent36 | B     | 5           | 5                        | 10          |

### Step 2: Calculate Average Total Positive Usability Score for Each Group, Excluding Respondents in That Group

- **Group A (Excluding A):** Respondents not in A are [49, 43, 30, 22, 50, 74, 37, 71, 36]. Their scores are [10, 10, 10, 8, 10, 10, 10, 9, 10]. Average = (10+10+10+8+10+10+10+9+10)/9 = 87/9 = 9.67
- **Group B (Excluding B):** Respondents not in B are [49, 43, 30, 22, 50, 74, 89, 37, 71]. Their scores are [10, 10, 10, 8, 10, 10, 8, 10, 9]. Average = (10+10+10+8+10+10+8+10+9)/9 = 85/9 = 9.44
- **Group C (Excluding C):** Respondents not in C are [49, 30, 74, 89, 71, 36]. Their scores are [10, 10, 10, 8, 9, 10]. Average = (10+10+10+8+9+10)/6 = 57/6 = 9.5
- **Group D (Excluding D):** Respondents not in D are [43, 22, 50, 89, 37, 36]. Their scores are [10, 8, 10, 8, 10, 10]. Average = (10+8+10+8+10+10)/6 = 56/6 = 9.33

### Step 3: Compare Each Respondent's Score to the Average of the Other Groups

- **Respondent49 (D):** Score = 10, Average of others = 9.33. Not lower.
- **Respondent43 (C):** Score = 10, Average of others = 9.67. Not lower.
- **Respondent30 (D):** Score = 10, Average of others = 9.33. Not lower.
- **Respondent22 (C):** Score = 8, Average of others = 9.67. Lower.
- **Respondent50 (C):** Score = 10, Average of others = 9.67. Not lower.
- **Respondent74 (D):** Score = 10, Average of others = 9.33. Not lower.
- **Respondent89 (A):** Score = 8, Average of others = 9.44. Lower.
- **Respondent37 (C):** Score = 10, Average of others = 9.67. Not lower.
- **Respondent71 (D):** Score = 9, Average of others = 9.33. Not lower.
- **Respondent36 (B):** Score = 10, Average of others = 9.5. Not lower.

### Count Respondents with Lower Score

From the comparison, **Respondent22** and **Respondent89** have scores lower than the average of the respondents not in their group.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$",True
case_42,respondent_count,Count the respondents who have a 'System_Complexity' score that is higher than the average 'System_Complexity' score for their group.,"@prefix : <http://example.org/survey#> .

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who have a 'System_Complexity' score that is higher than the average 'System_Complexity' score for their group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'System_Complexity' score for each group and then compare each respondent's score to this average to determine if it's higher.

From the 'questions' section, we understand that 'System_Complexity' is scored on a Likert scale of 1-5, where 1 = Strongly Disagree and 5 = Strongly Agree to the statement ""I found the system unnecessarily complex.""

Let's calculate the average 'System_Complexity' score for each group based on the responses provided:

1. **Group A (Senior)**: There are no respondents in Group A, so we cannot calculate an average.
2. **Group B (Junior)**:
   - Respondent36: 1
   - Respondent32: 1
   - Respondent14: 1
   - Average for Group B: (1 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 3 / 3 = 1
3. **Group C (Middle)**:
   - Respondent82: 1
   - Respondent4: 1
   - Respondent87: 2
   - Respondent70: 1
   - Average for Group C: (1 + 1 + 2 + 1) / 4 = 5 / 4 = 1.25
4. **Group D (Intern)**:
   - Respondent15: 2
   - Respondent29: 1
   - Respondent18: 1
   - Respondent12: 2
   - Average for Group D: (2 + 1 + 1 + 2) / 4 = 6 / 4 = 1.5

Now, let's identify respondents whose 'System_Complexity' score is higher than their group's average:

- **Group B**: All respondents have a score of 1, which is equal to the group average. None are higher.
- **Group C**: 
  - Respondent87 has a score of 2, which is higher than the group average of 1.25.
- **Group D**: 
  - Respondent15 and Respondent12 have scores of 2, which are higher than the group average of 1.5.

Thus, the respondents with a 'System_Complexity' score higher than their group's average are:

- Respondent87 (Group C)
- Respondent15 (Group D)
- Respondent12 (Group D)

There are **3** such respondents.",True
case_43,respondent_count,Count the respondents who have a total positive usability score ('Ease_of_Use' + 'Integration_of_Functions') that is lower than the average for all respondents not in their group.,"@prefix : <http://example.org/survey#> .

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who have a total positive usability score ('Ease_of_Use' + 'Integration_of_Functions') that is lower than the average for all respondents not in their group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average total positive usability score for each group, excluding the respondents in the 'Intern' group (which corresponds to option 'D'). Then, we compare each respondent's score to the average of the other groups to determine if it's lower.

1. **Calculate the total positive usability score for each respondent**: This is the sum of 'Ease_of_Use' and 'Integration_of_Functions' scores.

2. **Identify the respondents in the 'Intern' group**: These are the respondents with 'Group' = 'D'.

3. **Calculate the average total positive usability score for respondents not in the 'Intern' group**: Sum the total positive usability scores of all respondents not in the 'Intern' group and divide by the number of such respondents.

4. **Compare each 'Intern' respondent's score to the average of the other groups**: Count how many 'Intern' respondents have a total positive usability score lower than the calculated average.

Let's calculate:

- **Respondents and their total positive usability scores**:
  - Respondent5: 5 (Ease_of_Use) + 5 (Integration_of_Functions) = 10
  - Respondent37: 5 + 5 = 10
  - Respondent90: 5 + 5 = 10
  - Respondent19: 5 + 3 = 8

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who have a 'Integration_of_Functions' score that is higher than the average 'Integration_of_Functions' score for their group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Integration_of_Functions' score for each group and then compare each respondent's score to this average to determine if it's higher.

From the 'questions' section, we understand that the 'Group' is categorized as A. Senior, B. Junior, C. Middle, D. Intern, and 'Integration_of_Functions' is scored on a Likert scale of 1-5.

Let's calculate the average 'Integration_of_Functions' score for each group based on the 'responses' section:

1. **Group A (Senior)**: Respondent67 has a score of 5.
   - Average for A: 5

2. **Group B (Junior)**: Respondent23 has a score of 4.
   - Average for B: 4

3. **Group C (Middle)**: Respondents53 and 70 have scores of 5 and 5, respectively.
   - Average for C: (5 + 5) / 2 = 5

4. **Group D (Intern)**: Respondents90, 15, 49, and 29 have scores of 5, 5, 5, and 4, respectively.
   - Average for D: (5 + 5 + 5 + 4) / 4 = 4.75

Now, let's identify respondents whose 'Integration_of_Functions' score is higher than their group's average:

- **Group A**: Since the average is 5, and Respondent67's score is 5, there are no respondents with a score higher than the average.
- **Group B**: The average is 4, and Respondent23's score is 4, so there are no respondents with a score higher than the average.
- **Group C**: The average is 5, and both Respondents53 and 70 have scores of 5, so there are no respondents with a score higher than the average.
- **Group D**: The average is 4.75, and Respondents90, 15, and 49 have scores of 5, 5, and 5, respectively. Only these three have scores higher than the group average.

Therefore, the number of respondents who have an 'Integration_of_Functions' score higher than the average for their group is 3.",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who have a 'Confidence_in_Use' score that is higher than the average 'Confidence_in_Use' score for their group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Confidence_in_Use' score for each group and then count the respondents who have a score higher than their group's average.

1. **Identify Groups and Their Members:**
   - Group A: Respondent35, Respondent11
   - Group B: Respondent44, Respondent3
   - Group C: Respondent54, Respondent63, Respondent33, Respondent39, Respondent62
   - Group D: Respondent10

2. **Calculate Average 'Confidence_in_Use' Score for Each Group:**
   - **Group A:** (1 + 3) / 2 = 2
   - **Group B:** (1 + 5) / 2 = 3
   - **Group C:** (4 + 5 + 4 + 4 + 5) / 5 = 4.4
   - **Group D:** 5 (since there's only one respondent)

3. **Identify Respondents with 'Confidence_in_Use' Score Higher Than Their Group's Average:**
   - **Group A:** None (both scores are at or below the average)
   - **Group B:** Respondent3 (score 5, which is higher than the group average of 3)
   - **Group C:** Respondent63, Respondent62 (scores 5, which is higher than the group average of 4.4)
   - **Group D:** Since there's only one respondent and no average to compare against in the traditional sense, we don't count this respondent as their score is the average by default.

4. **Count These Respondents:**
   - Respondent3 (Group B)
   - Respondent63 (Group C)
   - Respondent62 (Group C)

Therefore, there are **3** respondents who have a 'Confidence_in_Use' score higher than the average 'Confidence_in_Use' score for their group.",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who have a 'Integration_of_Functions' score that is higher than the average 'Integration_of_Functions' score for their group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Integration_of_Functions' score for each group and then compare each respondent's score to this average to determine if it's higher.

From the 'questions' section, we understand that the 'Group' is categorized as A. Senior, B. Junior, C. Middle, D. Intern, and 'Integration_of_Functions' is scored on a Likert scale of 1-5.

Let's calculate the average 'Integration_of_Functions' score for each group based on the 'responses' section:

1. **Group A (Senior)**:
   - Respondent52: 4
   - Respondent6: 5
   - Respondent76: 4
   - Respondent67: 5
   - Average for Group A: (4 + 5 + 4 + 5) / 4 = 18 / 4 = 4.5

2. **Group C (Middle)**:
   - Respondent82: 4
   - Respondent20: 4
   - Average for Group C: (4 + 4) / 2 = 8 / 2 = 4

3. **Group D (Intern)**:
   - Respondent10: 5
   - Respondent30: 5
   - Average for Group D: (5 + 5) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5

Now, let's identify respondents with an 'Integration_of_Functions' score higher than their group's average:

- **Group A**: Average is 4.5. Respondents with scores higher than 4.5 are Respondent6 and Respondent67, both with a score of 5.
- **Group C**: Average is 4. There are no respondents with scores higher than 4.
- **Group D**: Average is 5. There are no respondents with scores higher than 5.

Counting these respondents:
- Respondent6
- Respondent67

There are **2** respondents who have an 'Integration_of_Functions' score higher than the average for their group.",True
case_47,respondent_count,Count the respondents in the 'Junior' group who have a 'Cumbersome_to_Use' score that is higher than the average 'Cumbersome_to_Use' for the 'Middle' group.,"@prefix : <http://example.org/survey#> .

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents in the 'Junior' group who have a 'Cumbersome_to_Use' score that is higher than the average 'Cumbersome_to_Use' for the 'Middle' group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Cumbersome_to_Use' score for the 'Middle' group and then identify the respondents in the 'Junior' group who have a 'Cumbersome_to_Use' score higher than this average.

1. **Identify 'Middle' group respondents and their 'Cumbersome_to_Use' scores:**
   - From the schema, 'Middle' corresponds to option ""C"".
   - Respondents in the 'Middle' group are: Respondent9, Respondent33, Respondent50, Respondent51.
   - Their 'Cumbersome_to_Use' scores are: 3, 1, 2, 1, respectively.

2. **Calculate the average 'Cumbersome_to_Use' score for the 'Middle' group:**
   - Sum of scores = 3 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 7
   - Number of respondents in 'Middle' group = 4
   - Average = Sum of scores / Number of respondents = 7 / 4 = 1.75

3. **Identify 'Junior' group respondents and their 'Cumbersome_to_Use' scores:**
   - From the schema, 'Junior' corresponds to option ""B"".
   - Respondents in the 'Junior' group are: Respondent44, Respondent66, Respondent79.
   - Their 'Cumbersome_to_Use' scores are: 1, 1, 1, respectively.

4. **Count 'Junior' group respondents with 'Cumbersome_to_Use' score higher than the 'Middle' group average (1.75):**
   - None of the 'Junior' group respondents have a 'Cumbersome_to_Use' score higher than 1.75.

Therefore, the count of respondents in the 'Junior' group who have a 'Cumbersome_to_Use' score higher than the average for the 'Middle' group is **0**.",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who have a 'Ease_of_Use' score that is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score for their group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Ease_of_Use' score for each group and then compare each respondent's score to this average to determine if it's higher.

1. **Calculate the average 'Ease_of_Use' score for each group:**

- Group A: Respondents 72 and 65 have scores of 5 and 5, respectively. Average = (5 + 5) / 2 = 5.
- Group B: Respondent 69 has a score of 5. Average = 5.
- Group C: Respondents 17 and 39 have scores of 5 and 1, respectively. Average = (5 + 1) / 2 = 3.
- Group D: Respondents 71, 41, and 25 have scores of 5, 5, and 3, respectively. Average = (5 + 5 + 3) / 3 = 4.33.

2. **Compare each respondent's 'Ease_of_Use' score to their group's average:**

- Respondent 71 (Group D): Score = 5, Group Average = 4.33. Higher.
- Respondent 41 (Group D): Score = 5, Group Average = 4.33. Higher.
- Respondent 17 (Group C): Score = 5, Group Average = 3. Higher.
- Respondent 72 (Group A): Score = 5, Group Average = 5. Not higher.
- Respondent 69 (Group B): Score = 5, Group Average = 5. Not higher.
- Respondent 39 (Group C): Score = 1, Group Average = 3. Not higher.
- Respondent 65 (Group A): Score = 5, Group Average = 5. Not higher.
- Respondent 25 (Group D): Score = 3, Group Average = 4.33. Not higher.

3. **Count the respondents with a score higher than their group's average:**

- Respondent 71
- Respondent 41
- Respondent 17

There are 3 respondents with an 'Ease_of_Use' score higher than the average for their group.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who have a 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score that is higher than the average 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score for their group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score for each group and then compare each respondent's score to this average to determine if it's higher.

1. **Calculate the average 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score for each group:**

- Group A: Respondents 42 and 6 have scores of 5 and 1, respectively. Average = (5 + 1) / 2 = 3.
- Group B: Respondents 66 and 36 have scores of 1 and 1, respectively. Average = (1 + 1) / 2 = 1.
- Group C: Respondents 9, 53, and 88 have scores of 5, 1, and 2, respectively. Average = (5 + 1 + 2) / 3 = 8 / 3 = 2.67.
- Group D: Respondents 45, 15, 71, and 7 have scores of 1, 1, 1, and 1, respectively. Average = (1 + 1 + 1 + 1) / 4 = 1.

2. **Compare each respondent's 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score to their group's average:**

- Group A:
  - Respondent 42: Score 5, Average 3. Higher.
  - Respondent 6: Score 1, Average 3. Not higher.
- Group B:
  - Respondent 66: Score 1, Average 1. Not higher.
  - Respondent 36: Score 1, Average 1. Not higher.
- Group C:
  - Respondent 9: Score 5, Average 2.67. Higher.
  - Respondent 53: Score 1, Average 2.67. Not higher.
  - Respondent 88: Score 2, Average 2.67. Not higher.
- Group D:
  - Respondent 45: Score 1, Average 1. Not higher.
  - Respondent 15: Score 1, Average 1. Not higher.
  - Respondent 71: Score 1, Average 1. Not higher.
  - Respondent 7: Score 1, Average 1. Not higher.

3. **Count the respondents with a score higher than their group's average:**

- Respondent 42 (Group A)
- Respondent 9 (Group C)

Therefore, there are **2** respondents who have a 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score that is higher than the average 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score for their group.",True
case_50,respondent_count,Count the respondents who have a total positive usability score ('Ease_of_Use' + 'Integration_of_Functions') that is lower than the average for all respondents not in their group.,"@prefix : <http://example.org/survey#> .

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who have a total positive usability score ('Ease_of_Use' + 'Integration_of_Functions') that is lower than the average for all respondents not in their group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average total positive usability score for each group, excluding the respondents in that group. Then, we compare each respondent's score to the average of the other groups to determine if it's lower.

1. **Calculate Total Positive Usability Score for Each Respondent:**
   - This score is the sum of 'Ease_of_Use' and 'Integration_of_Functions' for each respondent.

2. **Calculate Average Total Positive Usability Score for Each Group, Excluding Respondents in That Group:**
   - We need to calculate the average score for respondents not in each group (A, B, C, D) separately.

3. **Compare Each Respondent's Score to the Average of the Other Groups:**
   - If a respondent's score is lower than the average of the groups they are not part of, we count them.

Let's start with calculating the total positive usability scores for each respondent and then proceed with the averages for each group excluding its members.

### Respondents' Total Positive Usability Scores

- Respondent64: 2 (Ease_of_Use) + 2 (Integration_of_Functions) = 4
- Respondent35: 1 + 1 = 2
- Respondent47: 4 + 5 = 9
- Respondent82: 4 + 4 = 8
- Respondent32: 5 + 5 = 10
- Respondent89: 3 + 5 = 8
- Respondent61: 2 + 1 = 3
- Respondent43: 5 + 5 = 10
- Respondent11: 5 + 5 = 10

### Group Membership and Scores

- **A (Senior):** Respondent35, Respondent89, Respondent11
  - Scores: 2, 8, 10
- **B (Junior):** Respondent47, Respondent32, Respondent61
  - Scores: 9, 10, 3
- **C (Middle):** Respondent82, Respondent43
  - Scores: 8, 10
- **D (Intern):** Respondent64
  - Score: 4

### Calculate Average Scores Excluding Each Group

- **Average excluding A (Senior):** (9+10+3+8+10+4) / 6 = 44 / 6 = 7.33
- **Average excluding B (Junior):** (2+8+10+8+10+4) / 6 = 42 / 6 = 7
- **Average excluding C (Middle):** (2+9+10+3+8+4) / 6 = 36 / 6 = 6
- **Average excluding D (Intern):** (2+9+10+8+10+3+8+10) / 8 = 60 / 8 = 7.5

### Compare Each Respondent's Score to the Average of the Other Groups

- **Respondent64 (D):** 4 vs 7.5 (lower)
- **Respondent35 (A):** 2 vs 7.33 (lower)
- **Respondent47 (B):** 9 vs 7 (not lower)
- **Respondent82 (C):** 8 vs 6 (not lower)
- **Respondent32 (B):** 10 vs 7 (not lower)
- **Respondent89 (A):** 8 vs 7.33 (not lower)
- **Respondent61 (B):** 3 vs 7 (lower)
- **Respondent43 (C):** 10 vs 6 (not lower)
- **Respondent11 (A):** 10 vs 7.33 (not lower)

### Count Respondents with Lower Scores

- Respondent64 (D)
- Respondent35 (A)
- Respondent61 (B)

There are **3** respondents who have a total positive usability score lower than the average for all respondents not in their group.",True
