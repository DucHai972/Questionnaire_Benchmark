<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the respondents from the 'Junior' group who rated 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' as 1.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to identify the respondents who belong to the 'Junior' group and then check their ratings for 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use'.

From the 'questions' section, we understand that the 'Group' field is a multiple-choice question with the following options: ""A. Senior B. Junior C. Middle D. Intern"". Therefore, respondents who belong to the 'Junior' group will have their 'Group' answer as ""B"".

Next, we need to find respondents who rated 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' as 1, which means they strongly disagree that they needed to learn a lot of things before they could get going with the system.

Let's examine the 'responses' section:

1. Respondent ""31"" - Group: ""D"" (Intern), Need_to_Learn_Before_Use: ""1""
2. Respondent ""39"" - Group: ""C"" (Middle), Need_to_Learn_Before_Use: ""4""
3. Respondent ""14"" - Group: ""B"" (Junior), Need_to_Learn_Before_Use: ""3""
4. Respondent ""51"" - Group: ""C"" (Middle), Need_to_Learn_Before_Use: ""1""
5. Respondent ""62"" - Group: ""C"" (Middle), Need_to_Learn_Before_Use: ""1""
6. Respondent ""20"" - Group: ""C"" (Middle), Need_to_Learn_Before_Use: ""4""

None of the respondents from the 'Junior' group (Group ""B"") rated 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' as 1.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

Count the respondents from the 'Intern' group who rated 'Inconsistency' as 1.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to identify the respondents who belong to the 'Intern' group and then check their ratings for 'Inconsistency'.

From the 'questions' section, we understand that the 'Group' is categorized as ""[MCQ: A. Senior B. Junior C. Middle D. Intern]"". This means that respondents who answered ""D"" for the 'Group' question are in the 'Intern' group.

Next, we look at the 'responses' section to find respondents who are in the 'Intern' group (those who answered ""D"" for 'Group') and also rated 'Inconsistency' as 1.

Respondents 30, 48, and 25 are in the 'Intern' group because they answered ""D"" for 'Group'. Among them, respondents 30 and 48 rated 'Inconsistency' as 1.

Therefore, the count of respondents from the 'Intern' group who rated 'Inconsistency' as 1 is 2.",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents from the 'Junior' group who rated 'Ease_of_Learning' as 5.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to identify the respondents who belong to the 'Junior' group and then check their ratings for 'Ease_of_Learning' to see if they rated it as 5.

From the 'questions' section, we understand that the 'Group' field is a multiple-choice question with the following options: ""A. Senior B. Junior C. Middle D. Intern"". Therefore, respondents who belong to the 'Junior' group will have their 'Group' field answered as ""B"".

Next, we examine the 'responses' section to find respondents who are in the 'Junior' group and see how they rated 'Ease_of_Learning'.

Upon reviewing the responses:
- Respondent ""66"" is in group ""B"" (Junior) and rated 'Ease_of_Learning' as ""5"".
- Respondent ""61"" is also in group ""B"" (Junior) but rated 'Ease_of_Learning' as ""2"".

Thus, there is only 1 respondent from the 'Junior' group who rated 'Ease_of_Learning' as 5.

The final answer is: 1",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents from the 'Senior' group who rated 'Ease_of_Learning' as 5.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the respondents who belong to the 'Senior' group.
2. Among those, count the ones who rated 'Ease_of_Learning' as 5.

From the 'questions' section, we understand that the 'Group' field is a multiple-choice question with options:
- A. Senior
- B. Junior
- C. Middle
- D. Intern

We are looking for respondents who answered 'A' (which corresponds to 'Senior') for the 'Group' question and also answered '5' for the 'Ease_of_Learning' question.

Let's examine the 'responses' section:

1. Respondent ""34"" - Group: ""A"" (Senior), Ease_of_Learning: ""2"" (Does not match)
2. Respondent ""38"" - Group: ""A"" (Senior), Ease_of_Learning: ""4"" (Does not match)
3. Respondent ""88"" - Group: ""C"" (Middle), Ease_of_Learning: ""4"" (Does not match)
4. Respondent ""24"" - Group: ""C"" (Middle), Ease_of_Learning: ""2"" (Does not match)
5. Respondent ""84"" - Group: ""D"" (Intern), Ease_of_Learning: ""2"" (Does not match)
6. Respondent ""30"" - Group: ""D"" (Intern), Ease_of_Learning: ""5"" (Does not match because not Senior)
7. Respondent ""86"" - Group: ""A"" (Senior), Ease_of_Learning: ""5"" (Matches)
8. Respondent ""19"" - Group: ""C"" (Middle), Ease_of_Learning: ""4"" (Does not match)
9. Respondent ""29"" - Group: ""D"" (Intern), Ease_of_Learning: ""5"" (Does not match because not Senior)
10. Respondent ""83"" - Group: ""D"" (Intern), Ease_of_Learning: ""5"" (Does not match because not Senior)
11. Respondent ""17"" - Group: ""C"" (Middle), Ease_of_Learning: ""5"" (Does not match)

Only respondent ""86"" matches the criteria of being in the 'Senior' group and rating 'Ease_of_Learning' as 5.

The final answer is: 1",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents from the 'Junior' group who rated 'Confidence_in_Use' as 3.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to identify the respondents who belong to the 'Junior' group and then check their ratings for 'Confidence_in_Use' to see if any of them rated it as 3.

From the 'questions' section, we understand that the 'Group' field is a multiple-choice question with the following options: ""A. Senior B. Junior C. Middle D. Intern"". Therefore, respondents who belong to the 'Junior' group will have their 'Group' field answered with ""B"".

Next, we examine the 'responses' section to find respondents who are in the 'Junior' group and see how they rated 'Confidence_in_Use'.

Upon reviewing the responses:
- Respondent ""16"" is in group ""B"" (Junior) and rated 'Confidence_in_Use' as 5.
- Respondent ""26"" is in group ""B"" (Junior) and rated 'Confidence_in_Use' as 4.

None of the respondents in the 'Junior' group rated 'Confidence_in_Use' as 3.

The final answer is: 0",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who are in the 'Senior' group.
</task>","To determine the count of respondents in the 'Senior' group, we first need to identify the code associated with 'Senior' in the schema. According to the ""questions"" section, the schema for ""Group"" is ""[MCQ: A. Senior B. Junior C. Middle D. Intern]"". This means 'Senior' is associated with the code ""A"".

Next, we examine the ""responses"" section to find all instances where the ""Group"" answer is ""A"" (ignoring case, so ""a"" would also be included). 

Upon reviewing the responses:
- Respondent ""6"" answered ""A"".
- Respondent ""67"" answered ""A"".
- Respondent ""38"" answered ""A"".
- Respondent ""75"" answered ""A"".

Therefore, there are 4 respondents who are in the 'Senior' group. 

The final answer is: 4",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the respondents from the 'Middle' group who rated 'Ease_of_Use' as 3.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to identify the respondents who belong to the 'Middle' group and then check their ratings for 'Ease_of_Use' to find those who rated it as 3.

From the 'questions' section, we understand that the 'Group' is categorized as follows: ""A. Senior B. Junior C. Middle D. Intern"". Thus, respondents who belong to the 'Middle' group are those whose answer for 'Group' is 'C'.

Next, we examine the 'responses' to find respondents who are in the 'Middle' group ('Group' = 'C') and who rated 'Ease_of_Use' as 3.

Upon reviewing the responses:
- Respondent ""88"" is in group 'C' but rated 'Ease_of_Use' as 5.
- Respondent ""20"" is in group 'C' but rated 'Ease_of_Use' as 5.
- Respondent ""87"" is in group 'C' and rated 'Ease_of_Use' as 3.
- Respondent ""82"" is in group 'C' but rated 'Ease_of_Use' as 4.
- Respondent ""22"" is in group 'C' but rated 'Ease_of_Use' as 4.

Only respondent ""87"" meets the criteria of being in the 'Middle' group and rating 'Ease_of_Use' as 3.

Therefore, the count of respondents from the 'Middle' group who rated 'Ease_of_Use' as 3 is 1.",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who are in the 'Middle' group.
</task>","To determine the count of respondents in the 'Middle' group, we first need to identify the corresponding code for 'Middle' in the schema. According to the ""questions"" section, the schema for ""Group"" is ""[MCQ: A. Senior B. Junior C. Middle D. Intern]"". This means 'Middle' corresponds to the code ""C"".

Next, we examine the ""responses"" section to find all instances where the ""Group"" answer is ""C"" (ignoring case, so ""c"" would also be included). 

Upon reviewing the responses:
1. Respondent ""22"" answered ""C"".
2. Respondent ""54"" answered ""C"".
3. Respondent ""89"" answered ""A"".
4. Respondent ""82"" answered ""C"".
5. Respondent ""37"" answered ""C"".

All respondents who answered ""C"" are in the 'Middle' group. Therefore, the count of respondents in the 'Middle' group is 4. 

The final answer is: 4",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the respondents from the 'Junior' group who rated 'Cumbersome_to_Use' as 4.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the respondents who belong to the 'Junior' group.
2. Among those identified in step 1, count how many rated 'Cumbersome_to_Use' as 4.

From the 'questions' section, we understand that the 'Group' field is a multiple-choice question with options:
- A. Senior
- B. Junior
- C. Middle
- D. Intern

We are looking for respondents who chose 'B. Junior', which means their 'Group' answer is 'B'.

Next, we examine the 'responses' to find respondents who are in the 'Junior' group and see how they rated 'Cumbersome_to_Use'.

Going through the 'responses':
- Respondent ""32"" is in group 'B' (Junior) and rated 'Cumbersome_to_Use' as 1.
- Respondent ""79"" is in group 'B' (Junior) and rated 'Cumbersome_to_Use' as 1.
- Respondent ""16"" is in group 'B' (Junior) and rated 'Cumbersome_to_Use' as 1.

None of the respondents in the 'Junior' group rated 'Cumbersome_to_Use' as 4.

Therefore, the count of respondents from the 'Junior' group who rated 'Cumbersome_to_Use' as 4 is 0.",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose combined score for 'Ease_of_Use' and 'System_Complexity' is less than 6.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to iterate through each respondent's answers in the 'responses' section, calculate the combined score for 'Ease_of_Use' and 'System_Complexity', and count how many respondents have a combined score less than 6.

Given data:

- Respondent 26: Ease_of_Use = 4, System_Complexity = 2, Combined score = 6
- Respondent 85: Ease_of_Use = 5, System_Complexity = 1, Combined score = 6
- Respondent 27: Ease_of_Use = 2, System_Complexity = 4, Combined score = 6
- Respondent 56: Ease_of_Use = 4, System_Complexity = 2, Combined score = 6
- Respondent 77: Ease_of_Use = 5, System_Complexity = 1, Combined score = 6

From the calculations above, we see that none of the respondents have a combined score less than 6. All have a score of exactly 6.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents from the 'Intern' group who rated 'System_Complexity' as 2 and 'Integration_of_Functions' as 5.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify respondents who are in the 'Intern' group. According to the schema, 'Intern' corresponds to option 'D'.
2. Among those in the 'Intern' group, find respondents who rated 'System_Complexity' as 2.
3. Further filter the results to include only those who also rated 'Integration_of_Functions' as 5.

Given data:

- Respondents in the 'Intern' group are those with ""Group"": ""D"".
- We need to check each respondent's answers for 'System_Complexity' and 'Integration_of_Functions'.

Let's analyze the responses:

1. Respondent ""84"" is in the 'Intern' group (""Group"": ""D""), but their 'System_Complexity' rating is 3, not 2.
2. Respondent ""90"" is also in the 'Intern' group (""Group"": ""D""), with a 'System_Complexity' rating of 1, not 2, and an 'Integration_of_Functions' rating of 5.
3. No other respondents are in the 'Intern' group.

Since none of the respondents in the 'Intern' group rated 'System_Complexity' as 2 and 'Integration_of_Functions' as 5, the count is 0.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose combined score for 'Frequent_Usage' and 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' is less than 5.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to iterate through each respondent's answers in the 'responses' section, calculate the combined score for 'Frequent_Usage' and 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use', and count how many respondents have a combined score less than 5.

Given data:

- Respondent 15: 'Frequent_Usage' = 2, 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 2, Combined score = 4
- Respondent 17: 'Frequent_Usage' = 5, 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 1, Combined score = 6
- Respondent 70: 'Frequent_Usage' = 5, 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 1, Combined score = 6
- Respondent 77: 'Frequent_Usage' = 5, 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 1, Combined score = 6
- Respondent 23: 'Frequent_Usage' = 4, 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 3, Combined score = 7
- Respondent 29: 'Frequent_Usage' = 4, 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 1, Combined score = 5
- Respondent 82: 'Frequent_Usage' = 1, 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 5, Combined score = 6
- Respondent 60: 'Frequent_Usage' = 1, 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 2, Combined score = 3

Counting the respondents with a combined score less than 5:
- Respondent 15 has a score of 4.
- Respondent 60 has a score of 3.

Therefore, the number of respondents whose combined score for 'Frequent_Usage' and 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' is less than 5 is 2.",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who rated 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' and 'Inconsistency' with the same score.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to iterate through each respondent's answers in the 'responses' section and compare the scores for 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' and 'Inconsistency'. We then count how many respondents have the same score for both questions.

Given the data:

- Respondent 71: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 1, 'Inconsistency' = 2 (Different scores)
- Respondent 10: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 2, 'Inconsistency' = 1 (Different scores)
- Respondent 45: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 1, 'Inconsistency' = 1 (Same scores)
- Respondent 77: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 1, 'Inconsistency' = 1 (Same scores)
- Respondent 78: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 5, 'Inconsistency' = 4 (Different scores)
- Respondent 37: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 1, 'Inconsistency' = 1 (Same scores)
- Respondent 12: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 2, 'Inconsistency' = 2 (Same scores)
- Respondent 66: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 2, 'Inconsistency' = 2 (Same scores)
- Respondent 51: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 1, 'Inconsistency' = 1 (Same scores)
- Respondent 54: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 1, 'Inconsistency' = 1 (Same scores)
- Respondent 3: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 2, 'Inconsistency' = 4 (Different scores)

Counting the respondents with the same score for 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' and 'Inconsistency':

1. Respondent 45
2. Respondent 77
3. Respondent 37
4. Respondent 12
5. Respondent 66

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents from the 'Middle' group who rated 'System_Complexity' as 3 and 'Inconsistency' as 1.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the respondents who belong to the 'Middle' group. According to the 'questions' schema, 'Middle' corresponds to option 'C'.
2. Filter the responses to only include those from the 'Middle' group.
3. Among these, count the respondents who rated 'System_Complexity' as 3 and 'Inconsistency' as 1.

Let's analyze the data:

- Respondents in the 'Middle' group are those with ""Group"": ""C"".
- We then look for respondents with ""System_Complexity"": ""3"" and ""Inconsistency"": ""1"".

From the provided data:

- Respondent ""19"" is in the 'Middle' group (""Group"": ""C""), but their ""System_Complexity"" is ""1"" and ""Inconsistency"" is ""1"", which does not match our criteria.
- Respondent ""88"" is in the 'Middle' group (""Group"": ""C""), with ""System_Complexity"": ""2"" and ""Inconsistency"": ""3"", which also does not match.
- Respondent ""2"" is in the 'Middle' group (""Group"": ""C""), with ""System_Complexity"": ""1"" and ""Inconsistency"": ""1"", not matching.
- Respondent ""51"" is in the 'Middle' group (""Group"": ""C""), with ""System_Complexity"": ""1"" and ""Inconsistency"": ""1"", not matching.

None of the respondents in the 'Middle' group have ""System_Complexity"" rated as 3 and ""Inconsistency"" as 1.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose combined score for 'Frequent_Usage' and 'System_Complexity' is less than 8.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to iterate through each respondent's answers in the 'responses' section, calculate the combined score for 'Frequent_Usage' and 'System_Complexity', and then count how many of these combined scores are less than 8.

Given the data:

- 'Frequent_Usage' is scored from 1 to 5, where 1 = Strongly Disagree and 5 = Strongly Agree.
- 'System_Complexity' is scored from 1 to 5, where 1 = Strongly Disagree and 5 = Strongly Agree.

We calculate the combined score by adding the scores of 'Frequent_Usage' and 'System_Complexity' for each respondent.

Let's calculate:

1. Respondent 10: 'Frequent_Usage' = 5, 'System_Complexity' = 1, Combined = 6
2. Respondent 28: 'Frequent_Usage' = 5, 'System_Complexity' = 1, Combined = 6
3. Respondent 19: 'Frequent_Usage' = 1, 'System_Complexity' = 1, Combined = 2
4. Respondent 39: 'Frequent_Usage' = 2, 'System_Complexity' = 4, Combined = 6
5. Respondent 90: 'Frequent_Usage' = 5, 'System_Complexity' = 1, Combined = 6
6. Respondent 31: 'Frequent_Usage' = 2, 'System_Complexity' = 1, Combined = 3
7. Respondent 64: 'Frequent_Usage' = 1, 'System_Complexity' = 3, Combined = 4
8. Respondent 4: 'Frequent_Usage' = 4, 'System_Complexity' = 1, Combined = 5

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the respondents whose combined score for 'Cumbersome_to_Use' and 'System_Complexity' is less than 4.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to iterate through each respondent's answers in the 'responses' section and check their scores for 'Cumbersome_to_Use' and 'System_Complexity'. We then combine these scores and check if the sum is less than 4. If it is, we count that respondent.

Given data:

- Respondent 74: 'Cumbersome_to_Use' = 1, 'System_Complexity' = 1, Sum = 2
- Respondent 22: 'Cumbersome_to_Use' = 2, 'System_Complexity' = 2, Sum = 4
- Respondent 81: 'Cumbersome_to_Use' = 2, 'System_Complexity' = 1, Sum = 3
- Respondent 30: 'Cumbersome_to_Use' = 1, 'System_Complexity' = 1, Sum = 2
- Respondent 36: 'Cumbersome_to_Use' = 1, 'System_Complexity' = 1, Sum = 2
- Respondent 62: 'Cumbersome_to_Use' = 1, 'System_Complexity' = 1, Sum = 2
- Respondent 84: 'Cumbersome_to_Use' = 4, 'System_Complexity' = 3, Sum = 7
- Respondent 69: 'Cumbersome_to_Use' = 1, 'System_Complexity' = 4, Sum = 5

Respondents with a combined score less than 4 are:
- Respondent 74 (Sum = 2)
- Respondent 81 (Sum = 3)
- Respondent 30 (Sum = 2)
- Respondent 36 (Sum = 2)
- Respondent 62 (Sum = 2)

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents from the 'Senior' group who rated 'Ease_of_Learning' as 4 and 'Frequent_Usage' as 2.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to follow the instructions carefully and analyze the provided data.

First, we need to identify the respondents who belong to the 'Senior' group. According to the 'questions' schema, the 'Group' field is a multiple-choice question with the following options: ""A. Senior B. Junior C. Middle D. Intern"". Therefore, we need to look for respondents who answered ""A"" (case-insensitive) to the 'Group' question.

Next, we need to identify the respondents who rated 'Ease_of_Learning' as 4 and 'Frequent_Usage' as 2.

After analyzing the 'responses' section, we can see that there is one respondent who meets the specified criteria:

- Respondent ""55"" belongs to the 'Senior' group (answered ""A"" to the 'Group' question), rated 'Ease_of_Learning' as 4, and rated 'Frequent_Usage' as 2.

Therefore, the count of respondents from the 'Senior' group who rated 'Ease_of_Learning' as 4 and 'Frequent_Usage' as 2 is 1.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents from the 'Junior' group who rated 'Cumbersome_to_Use' as 1 and 'System_Complexity' as 1.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to identify the respondents who belong to the 'Junior' group, then check which of these respondents rated 'Cumbersome_to_Use' as 1 and 'System_Complexity' as 1.

From the 'questions' section, we understand that the 'Group' is categorized as ""[MCQ: A. Senior B. Junior C. Middle D. Intern]"". Thus, respondents who are in the 'Junior' group will have their 'Group' answer as ""B"".

We then need to find respondents who have 'Group' as ""B"", 'Cumbersome_to_Use' as ""1"", and 'System_Complexity' as ""1"".

Let's examine the 'responses' section:

1. Respondent ""44"" - Group: ""B"", Cumbersome_to_Use: ""1"", System_Complexity: ""2"" (Does not match)
2. Respondent ""8"" - Group: ""B"", Cumbersome_to_Use: ""4"", System_Complexity: ""1"" (Does not match)
3. Respondent ""68"" - Group: ""B"", Cumbersome_to_Use: ""1"", System_Complexity: ""3"" (Does not match)
4. Respondent ""36"" - Group: ""B"", Cumbersome_to_Use: ""1"", System_Complexity: ""1"" (Matches)

Therefore, there is only 1 respondent from the 'Junior' group who rated 'Cumbersome_to_Use' as 1 and 'System_Complexity' as 1.

The final answer is: 1",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who rated 'Ease_of_Learning' and 'Inconsistency' with the same score.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to iterate through each respondent's answers in the 'responses' section and compare their scores for 'Ease_of_Learning' and 'Inconsistency'. We are looking for respondents where these two scores are the same.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who rated 'Inconsistency' and 'Ease_of_Use' with the same score.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to iterate through each respondent's answers in the 'responses' section and compare their scores for 'Inconsistency' and 'Ease_of_Use'. We will count how many respondents have the same score for both questions.

Given data:

- 'Inconsistency' scores range from 1 to 5.
- 'Ease_of_Use' scores also range from 1 to 5.

We compare each respondent's scores for these two questions and count those where the scores are identical.

Let's examine the responses:

1. Respondent ""88"": Inconsistency = 3, Ease_of_Use = 5. Scores are not the same.
2. Respondent ""78"": Inconsistency = 4, Ease_of_Use = 3. Scores are not the same.
3. Respondent ""12"": Inconsistency = 2, Ease_of_Use = 5. Scores are not the same.
4. Respondent ""80"": Inconsistency = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5. Scores are not the same.
5. Respondent ""86"": Inconsistency = 3, Ease_of_Use = 1. Scores are not the same.
6. Respondent ""82"": Inconsistency = 1, Ease_of_Use = 4. Scores are not the same.
7. Respondent ""66"": Inconsistency = 2, Ease_of_Use = 5. Scores are not the same.
8. Respondent ""5"": Inconsistency = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5. Scores are not the same.
9. Respondent ""81"": Inconsistency = 2, Ease_of_Use = 5. Scores are not the same.
10. Respondent ""48"": Inconsistency = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5. Scores are not the same.

Upon reviewing the data, there are no respondents who rated 'Inconsistency' and 'Ease_of_Use' with the same score.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who rated 'Integration_of_Functions' and 'Inconsistency' with the same score.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to iterate through each respondent's answers in the 'responses' section and check if the scores for 'Integration_of_Functions' and 'Inconsistency' are the same.

After analyzing the data, I found that the respondents with the same score for 'Integration_of_Functions' and 'Inconsistency' are:

- Respondent ""82"" with scores ""4"" and ""1"" (not the same)
- Respondent ""54"" with scores ""5"" and ""1"" (not the same)
- Respondent ""55"" with scores ""3"" and ""1"" (not the same)
- Respondent ""14"" with scores ""3"" and ""1"" (not the same)
- Respondent ""9"" with scores ""1"" and ""5"" (not the same)
- Respondent ""47"" with scores ""5"" and ""1"" (not the same)
- Respondent ""90"" with scores ""5"" and ""2"" (not the same)
- Respondent ""60"" with scores ""4"" and ""2"" (not the same)
- Respondent ""48"" with scores ""5"" and ""1"" (not the same)
- Respondent ""6"" with scores ""5"" and ""1"" (not the same)
- Respondent ""78"" with scores ""4"" and ""4"" (the same)

There is only 1 respondent who rated 'Integration_of_Functions' and 'Inconsistency' with the same score.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who rated 'Frequent_Usage' and 'System_Complexity' with the same score.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to iterate through each respondent's answers in the 'responses' section and compare their scores for 'Frequent_Usage' and 'System_Complexity'. We then count how many respondents have the same score for both.

Given the data:

- Respondent 27: 'Frequent_Usage' = 1, 'System_Complexity' = 4 (Different)
- Respondent 34: 'Frequent_Usage' = 1, 'System_Complexity' = 4 (Different)
- Respondent 50: 'Frequent_Usage' = 1, 'System_Complexity' = 1 (Same)
- Respondent 4: 'Frequent_Usage' = 4, 'System_Complexity' = 1 (Different)
- Respondent 25: 'Frequent_Usage' = 3, 'System_Complexity' = 3 (Same)
- Respondent 29: 'Frequent_Usage' = 4, 'System_Complexity' = 1 (Different)
- Respondent 51: 'Frequent_Usage' = 4, 'System_Complexity' = 1 (Different)
- Respondent 73: 'Frequent_Usage' = 1, 'System_Complexity' = 1 (Same)
- Respondent 1: 'Frequent_Usage' = 3, 'System_Complexity' = 1 (Different)

From the comparisons, the respondents with the same score for 'Frequent_Usage' and 'System_Complexity' are respondents 50, 25, and 73.

Therefore, the count of respondents who rated 'Frequent_Usage' and 'System_Complexity' with the same score is 3.",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who rated 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' and 'Integration_of_Functions' with the same score.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to iterate through each respondent's answers in the 'responses' section and compare the scores for 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' and 'Integration_of_Functions'. We count the respondents where these two scores are the same.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the respondents who have a total positive usability score ('Ease_of_Use' + 'Integration_of_Functions') that is lower than the average for all respondents not in their group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average total positive usability score for each group, excluding the respondents in that group. Then, we compare each respondent's score to the average of the other groups to determine if it's lower.

1. **Calculate Total Positive Usability Score for Each Respondent:**
   - This score is the sum of 'Ease_of_Use' and 'Integration_of_Functions' for each respondent.

2. **Determine the Group of Each Respondent:**
   - Map the 'Group' answer to its corresponding text (A. Senior, B. Junior, C. Middle, D. Intern).

3. **Calculate the Average Total Positive Usability Score for Each Group, Excluding Respondents in That Group:**
   - For each group, sum the total positive usability scores of all respondents not in that group.
   - Divide this sum by the number of respondents not in that group to get the average.

4. **Compare Each Respondent's Score to the Average of the Other Groups:**
   - If a respondent's total positive usability score is lower than the average score of the respondents not in their group, count them.

Given the data:

}
```

Let's calculate the total positive usability score for each respondent and their group:

1. Respondent 49, Group D: 5 + 5 = 10
2. Respondent 43, Group C: 5 + 5 = 10
3. Respondent 30, Group D: 5 + 5 = 10
4. Respondent 22, Group C: 4 + 4 = 8
5. Respondent 50, Group C: 5 + 5 = 10
6. Respondent 74, Group D: 5 + 5 = 10
7. Respondent 89, Group A: 3 + 5 = 8
8. Respondent 37, Group C: 5 + 5 = 10
9. Respondent 71, Group D: 5 + 4 = 9
10. Respondent 36, Group B: 5 + 5 = 10

**Group A (Senior):** Respondent 89 with a score of 8.

**Group B (Junior):** Respondent 36 with a score of 10.

**Group C (Middle):** Respondents 43, 22, 50, 37 with scores of 10, 8, 10, 10 respectively.

**Group D (Intern):** Respondents 49, 30, 74, 71 with scores of 10, 10, 10, 9 respectively.

Now, let's calculate the average total positive usability score for each group, excluding the respondents in that group:

- **For Group A (excluding A):** (10+10+10+10+10+10+10+10+9) / 9 = 89 / 9 = 9.89
- **For Group B (excluding B):** (10+10+10+10+10+10+10+8+8+9) / 9 = 85 / 9 = 9.44
- **For Group C (excluding C):** (10+10+10+10+8+10+9) / 6 = 67 / 6 = 11.17
- **For Group D (excluding D):** (10+10+10+10+8+8+10) / 6 = 66 / 6 = 11

Comparing each respondent's score to the average of the other groups:

- Respondent 89 (Group A) with a score of 8 is lower than 9.89, so count.
- Respondent 36 (Group B) with a score of 10 is higher than 9.44, so do not count.
- Respondents in Group C (22 with a score of 8) is lower than 11.17, so count.
- Respondents in Group D (71 with a score of 9) is lower than 11, so count.

Therefore, the respondents who have a total positive usability score that is lower than the average for all respondents not in their group are:

- Respondent 89 (Group A)
- Respondent 22 (Group C)
- Respondent 71 (Group D)

So, the count is **3**.",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who have a 'System_Complexity' score that is higher than the average 'System_Complexity' score for their group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'System_Complexity' score for each group and then compare each respondent's score to this average to determine if it's higher.

Given the 'questions' section, we understand that 'Group' is categorized as A. Senior, B. Junior, C. Middle, D. Intern, and 'System_Complexity' is scored from 1 to 5.

Let's calculate the average 'System_Complexity' score for each group based on the 'responses' section:

1. **Group A (Senior):** There are no respondents in Group A, so we cannot calculate an average.
2. **Group B (Junior):**
   - Respondent 36: Score = 1
   - Respondent 32: Score = 1
   - Respondent 14: Score = 1
   - Average = (1 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 1
3. **Group C (Middle):**
   - Respondent 82: Score = 1
   - Respondent 4: Score = 1
   - Respondent 87: Score = 2
   - Respondent 70: Score = 1
   - Average = (1 + 1 + 2 + 1) / 4 = 1.25
4. **Group D (Intern):**
   - Respondent 15: Score = 2
   - Respondent 29: Score = 1
   - Respondent 18: Score = 1
   - Respondent 12: Score = 2
   - Average = (2 + 1 + 1 + 2) / 4 = 1.5

Now, let's count the respondents who have a 'System_Complexity' score higher than their group's average:

1. **Group B (Junior):** Average = 1. No respondents have a score higher than 1.
2. **Group C (Middle):** Average = 1.25. Only Respondent 87 with a score of 2 has a higher score.
3. **Group D (Intern):** Average = 1.5. Respondents 15 and 12 with scores of 2 have higher scores than the average.

Counting these respondents:
- Respondent 87 (Group C)
- Respondent 15 (Group D)
- Respondent 12 (Group D)

There are **3** respondents who have a 'System_Complexity' score higher than the average for their group.",True
case_43,respondent_count,Count the respondents who have a total positive usability score ('Ease_of_Use' + 'Integration_of_Functions') that is lower than the average for all respondents not in their group.,"{

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the respondents who have a total positive usability score ('Ease_of_Use' + 'Integration_of_Functions') that is lower than the average for all respondents not in their group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average total positive usability score for each group, excluding the respondents in that group. Then, we compare each respondent's score to the average of the other groups to determine if it's lower.

1. **Calculate Total Positive Usability Score for Each Respondent:**
   - This score is the sum of 'Ease_of_Use' and 'Integration_of_Functions' for each respondent.

2. **Calculate Average Total Positive Usability Score for Each Group, Excluding Respondents in That Group:**
   - We need to calculate the average score for respondents not in each group (A, B, C, D) separately.

3. **Compare Each Respondent's Score to the Average of the Other Groups:**
   - If a respondent's score is lower than the average score of the groups they are not part of, we count them.

Given the complexity and the need for step-by-step calculation based on the provided data, let's break down the process with the given data:

### Step 1: Calculate Total Positive Usability Score for Each Respondent

| Respondent | Group | Ease_of_Use | Integration_of_Functions | Total Score |
|------------|-------|-------------|--------------------------|-------------|
| 5          | C     | 5           | 5                        | 10          |
| 37         | C     | 5           | 5                        | 10          |
| 90         | D     | 5           | 5                        | 10          |
| 19         | C     | 5           | 3                        | 8           |
| 60         | D     | 5           | 4                        | 9           |
| 48         | D     | 5           | 5                        | 10          |
| 86         | A     | 1           | 5                        | 6           |
| 13         | A     | 5           | 5                        | 10          |
| 59         | A     | 5           | 5                        | 10          |
| 77         | D     | 5           | 4                        | 9           |
| 64         | D     | 2           | 2                        | 4           |
| 78         | D     | 3           | 4                        | 7           |

### Step 2: Calculate Average Total Positive Usability Score for Each Group, Excluding Respondents in That Group

- **Group A Excluded:** (10+10+10+10+9+9+10+4+7) / 8 = 79 / 8 = 9.875
- **Group B Excluded:** Since there are no respondents in Group B, we consider all respondents: (10+10+10+8+9+10+6+10+10+9+4+7) / 12 = 99 / 12 = 8.25
- **Group C Excluded:** (10+10+9+9+10+6+10+10+9+4+7) / 10 = 90 / 10 = 9
- **Group D Excluded:** (10+10+8+6+10+10+10) / 7 = 64 / 7 = 9.142857 (approximately)

### Step 3: Compare Each Respondent's Score to the Average of the Other Groups

- **For Group A (Respondents 86, 13, 59):** 
  - Respondent 86: 6 < 9.142857, Counted.
  - Respondent 13: 10 >= 9.142857, Not Counted.
  - Respondent 59: 10 >= 9.142857, Not Counted.
- **For Group B:** No respondents.
- **For Group C (Respondents 5, 37, 19):** 
  - Respondent 5: 10 >= 8.25, Not Counted.
  - Respondent 37: 10 >= 8.25, Not Counted.
  - Respondent 19: 8 < 8.25, Counted.
- **For Group D (Respondents 90, 60, 48, 77, 64, 78):** 
  - Respondent 90: 10 >= 9, Not Counted.
  - Respondent 60: 9 >= 9, Not Counted.
  - Respondent 48: 10 >= 9, Not Counted.
  - Respondent 77: 9 >= 9, Not Counted.
  - Respondent 64: 4 < 9, Counted.
  - Respondent 78: 7 < 9, Counted.

### Counted Respondents

Based on the comparison, the respondents who have a total positive usability score lower than the average for all respondents not in their group are:

- Respondent 86
- Respondent 19
- Respondent 64
- Respondent 78

Therefore, the number of respondents who meet the condition is **4**.",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the respondents who have a 'Integration_of_Functions' score that is higher than the average 'Integration_of_Functions' score for their group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Integration_of_Functions' score for each group and then compare each respondent's score to this average to determine if it's higher.

Given the 'questions' section, we understand that the 'Group' is categorized as follows: A. Senior, B. Junior, C. Middle, D. Intern.

From the 'responses' section, we extract the necessary data:

1. Respondent 53, Group C, Integration_of_Functions: 5
2. Respondent 67, Group A, Integration_of_Functions: 5
3. Respondent 70, Group C, Integration_of_Functions: 5
4. Respondent 90, Group D, Integration_of_Functions: 5
5. Respondent 15, Group D, Integration_of_Functions: 5
6. Respondent 23, Group B, Integration_of_Functions: 4
7. Respondent 49, Group D, Integration_of_Functions: 5
8. Respondent 29, Group D, Integration_of_Functions: 4

Let's calculate the average 'Integration_of_Functions' score for each group:

- Group A (Senior): (5) / 1 = 5
- Group B (Junior): (4) / 1 = 4
- Group C (Middle): (5 + 5) / 2 = 5
- Group D (Intern): (5 + 5 + 5 + 4) / 4 = 4.75

Now, we compare each respondent's 'Integration_of_Functions' score to their group's average:

1. Respondent 53, Group C, Score: 5, Average: 5 (Not higher)
2. Respondent 67, Group A, Score: 5, Average: 5 (Not higher)
3. Respondent 70, Group C, Score: 5, Average: 5 (Not higher)
4. Respondent 90, Group D, Score: 5, Average: 4.75 (Higher)
5. Respondent 15, Group D, Score: 5, Average: 4.75 (Higher)
6. Respondent 23, Group B, Score: 4, Average: 4 (Not higher)
7. Respondent 49, Group D, Score: 5, Average: 4.75 (Higher)
8. Respondent 29, Group D, Score: 4, Average: 4.75 (Not higher)

Counting the respondents with a score higher than their group's average:

- Respondent 90
- Respondent 15
- Respondent 49

There are 3 respondents with an 'Integration_of_Functions' score higher than the average for their group.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$",True
case_45,respondent_count,Count the respondents who have a 'Confidence_in_Use' score that is higher than the average 'Confidence_in_Use' score for their group.,"{

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who have a 'Confidence_in_Use' score that is higher than the average 'Confidence_in_Use' score for their group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Confidence_in_Use' score for each group and then count the respondents who have a 'Confidence_in_Use' score higher than the average for their respective group.

Given the data, let's first map the group codes to their respective names for clarity:
- A: Senior
- B: Junior
- C: Middle
- D: Intern

Now, let's calculate the average 'Confidence_in_Use' score for each group:

1. **Senior (A)**:
   - Respondent 35: Confidence_in_Use = 1
   - Respondent 11: Confidence_in_Use = 3
   - Average for Senior = (1 + 3) / 2 = 2

2. **Junior (B)**:
   - Respondent 44: Confidence_in_Use = 1
   - Respondent 3: Confidence_in_Use = 5
   - Average for Junior = (1 + 5) / 2 = 3

3. **Middle (C)**:
   - Respondent 54: Confidence_in_Use = 4
   - Respondent 63: Confidence_in_Use = 5
   - Respondent 33: Confidence_in_Use = 4
   - Respondent 39: Confidence_in_Use = 4
   - Respondent 62: Confidence_in_Use = 5
   - Average for Middle = (4 + 5 + 4 + 4 + 5) / 5 = 4.4

4. **Intern (D)**:
   - Respondent 10: Confidence_in_Use = 5
   - Since there's only one respondent in this group, the average is 5.

Next, we identify respondents with a 'Confidence_in_Use' score higher than their group's average:

1. **Senior (A)**: None, since both scores are at or below the group average.
2. **Junior (B)**: Respondent 3 has a score of 5, which is higher than the group average of 3.
3. **Middle (C)**: Respondents 63 and 62 have scores of 5, which is higher than the group average of 4.4.
4. **Intern (D)**: Since the average is 5 and the respondent's score is exactly 5, there are no respondents with a score higher than the average.

Counting these respondents:
- Respondent 3 (Junior)
- Respondent 63 (Middle)
- Respondent 62 (Middle)

There are **3** respondents who have a 'Confidence_in_Use' score higher than the average for their group.",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who have a 'Integration_of_Functions' score that is higher than the average 'Integration_of_Functions' score for their group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Integration_of_Functions' score for each group and then compare each respondent's score to this average to determine if it's higher.

Given the 'questions' section, we understand that 'Group' is categorized as A. Senior, B. Junior, C. Middle, D. Intern, and 'Integration_of_Functions' is scored on a Likert scale of 1-5.

From the 'responses' section, we can extract the necessary data:

1. **Group A (Senior)**:
   - Respondent 52: Integration_of_Functions = 4
   - Respondent 6: Integration_of_Functions = 5
   - Respondent 76: Integration_of_Functions = 4
   - Respondent 67: Integration_of_Functions = 5

2. **Group C (Middle)**:
   - Respondent 82: Integration_of_Functions = 4
   - Respondent 20: Integration_of_Functions = 4

3. **Group D (Intern)**:
   - Respondent 10: Integration_of_Functions = 5
   - Respondent 30: Integration_of_Functions = 5

**Calculating Average 'Integration_of_Functions' Score for Each Group:**

- **Group A (Senior)**: (4 + 5 + 4 + 5) / 4 = 18 / 4 = 4.5
- **Group C (Middle)**: (4 + 4) / 2 = 8 / 2 = 4
- **Group D (Intern)**: (5 + 5) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5

**Comparing Each Respondent's Score to the Group Average:**

- **Group A**:
  - Respondent 52: 4 (lower than 4.5)
  - Respondent 6: 5 (higher than 4.5)
  - Respondent 76: 4 (lower than 4.5)
  - Respondent 67: 5 (higher than 4.5)
- **Group C**:
  - Respondent 82: 4 (equal to 4)
  - Respondent 20: 4 (equal to 4)
- **Group D**:
  - Respondent 10: 5 (equal to 5)
  - Respondent 30: 5 (equal to 5)

**Counting Respondents with Higher Scores than Their Group Average:**

- From **Group A**: 2 respondents (6, 67)
- From **Group C**: 0 respondents
- From **Group D**: 0 respondents

Therefore, the total number of respondents who have an 'Integration_of_Functions' score higher than the average for their group is 2.",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the respondents in the 'Junior' group who have a 'Cumbersome_to_Use' score that is higher than the average 'Cumbersome_to_Use' for the 'Middle' group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the respondents in the 'Junior' group.
2. Calculate the average 'Cumbersome_to_Use' score for the 'Middle' group.
3. Count the respondents in the 'Junior' group who have a 'Cumbersome_to_Use' score higher than the average calculated in step 2.

From the 'questions' section, we know that 'Junior' corresponds to option 'B' and 'Middle' corresponds to option 'C' in the 'Group' question.

Let's analyze the data:

- Respondents in the 'Junior' group are those with 'Group' = 'B'.
- Respondents in the 'Middle' group are those with 'Group' = 'C'.

**Step 1: Identify respondents in the 'Junior' group and their 'Cumbersome_to_Use' scores.**

Respondents in the 'Junior' group:
- 44: 'Cumbersome_to_Use' = 1
- 66: 'Cumbersome_to_Use' = 1
- 79: 'Cumbersome_to_Use' = 1

**Step 2: Calculate the average 'Cumbersome_to_Use' score for the 'Middle' group.**

Respondents in the 'Middle' group:
- 9: 'Cumbersome_to_Use' = 3
- 33: 'Cumbersome_to_Use' = 1
- 50: 'Cumbersome_to_Use' = 2
- 51: 'Cumbersome_to_Use' = 1

Average 'Cumbersome_to_Use' for 'Middle' group = (3 + 1 + 2 + 1) / 4 = 7 / 4 = 1.75

**Step 3: Count the respondents in the 'Junior' group with a 'Cumbersome_to_Use' score higher than the average for the 'Middle' group.**

Since the average 'Cumbersome_to_Use' score for the 'Middle' group is 1.75, we look for 'Junior' group respondents with a 'Cumbersome_to_Use' score > 1.75.

None of the respondents in the 'Junior' group have a 'Cumbersome_to_Use' score higher than 1.75, as all of them have a score of 1.

Therefore, the count of respondents in the 'Junior' group who have a 'Cumbersome_to_Use' score higher than the average 'Cumbersome_to_Use' for the 'Middle' group is 0.",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who have a 'Ease_of_Use' score that is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score for their group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Ease_of_Use' score for each group and then compare each respondent's score to this average to determine if it's higher.

Given the 'questions' section, we understand that 'Group' is categorized as A. Senior, B. Junior, C. Middle, D. Intern, and 'Ease_of_Use' is scored from 1 to 5.

From the 'responses' section, we can extract the necessary data:

1. Respondent 71, Group D, Ease_of_Use: 5
2. Respondent 41, Group D, Ease_of_Use: 5
3. Respondent 17, Group C, Ease_of_Use: 5
4. Respondent 72, Group A, Ease_of_Use: 5
5. Respondent 69, Group B, Ease_of_Use: 5
6. Respondent 39, Group C, Ease_of_Use: 1
7. Respondent 65, Group A, Ease_of_Use: 5
8. Respondent 25, Group D, Ease_of_Use: 3

First, calculate the average 'Ease_of_Use' score for each group:

- Group A (Senior): (5 + 5) / 2 = 5
- Group B (Junior): 5 / 1 = 5
- Group C (Middle): (5 + 1) / 2 = 3
- Group D (Intern): (5 + 5 + 3) / 3 = 13 / 3 = 4.33

Now, compare each respondent's 'Ease_of_Use' score to their group's average:

1. Respondent 71, Group D, Ease_of_Use: 5, Group Average: 4.33, Higher: Yes
2. Respondent 41, Group D, Ease_of_Use: 5, Group Average: 4.33, Higher: Yes
3. Respondent 17, Group C, Ease_of_Use: 5, Group Average: 3, Higher: Yes
4. Respondent 72, Group A, Ease_of_Use: 5, Group Average: 5, Higher: No
5. Respondent 69, Group B, Ease_of_Use: 5, Group Average: 5, Higher: No
6. Respondent 39, Group C, Ease_of_Use: 1, Group Average: 3, Higher: No
7. Respondent 65, Group A, Ease_of_Use: 5, Group Average: 5, Higher: No
8. Respondent 25, Group D, Ease_of_Use: 3, Group Average: 4.33, Higher: No

Counting the respondents with a score higher than their group's average:

- Respondent 71
- Respondent 41
- Respondent 17

There are 3 respondents with an 'Ease_of_Use' score higher than the average for their group.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who have a 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score that is higher than the average 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score for their group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score for each group, and then count the respondents who have a score higher than the average for their respective group.

Given the data, let's first map the group codes to their respective names for clarity:

- A: Senior
- B: Junior
- C: Middle
- D: Intern

Now, let's calculate the average 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score for each group:

1. **Senior (A)**: Respondents 42 and 6 belong to this group.
   - Respondent 42: Score = 5
   - Respondent 6: Score = 1
   - Average = (5 + 1) / 2 = 3

2. **Junior (B)**: Respondents 66 and 36 belong to this group.
   - Respondent 66: Score = 1
   - Respondent 36: Score = 1
   - Average = (1 + 1) / 2 = 1

3. **Middle (C)**: Respondents 9, 53, and 88 belong to this group.
   - Respondent 9: Score = 5
   - Respondent 53: Score = 1
   - Respondent 88: Score = 2
   - Average = (5 + 1 + 2) / 3 = 8 / 3 = 2.67

4. **Intern (D)**: Respondents 45, 15, 71, and 7 belong to this group.
   - Respondent 45: Score = 1
   - Respondent 15: Score = 1
   - Respondent 71: Score = 1
   - Respondent 7: Score = 1
   - Average = (1 + 1 + 1 + 1) / 4 = 4 / 4 = 1

Now, let's identify respondents with a 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score higher than their group's average:

1. **Senior (A)**: Average = 3
   - Respondent 42: Score = 5 (Higher than average)
   - Respondent 6: Score = 1 (Not higher than average)

2. **Junior (B)**: Average = 1
   - No respondents have a score higher than 1 in this group.

3. **Middle (C)**: Average = 2.67
   - Respondent 9: Score = 5 (Higher than average)
   - Respondent 53: Score = 1 (Not higher than average)
   - Respondent 88: Score = 2 (Not higher than average)

4. **Intern (D)**: Average = 1
   - No respondents have a score higher than 1 in this group.

Respondents with a score higher than their group's average are:
- Respondent 42 (Senior)
- Respondent 9 (Middle)

Therefore, the count of respondents who have a 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score higher than the average for their group is 2.",True
case_50,respondent_count,Count the respondents who have a total positive usability score ('Ease_of_Use' + 'Integration_of_Functions') that is lower than the average for all respondents not in their group.,"{

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who have a total positive usability score ('Ease_of_Use' + 'Integration_of_Functions') that is lower than the average for all respondents not in their group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average total positive usability score for each group, excluding the respondents in that group. Then, we compare each respondent's score to the average of the other groups to determine if it's lower.

1. **Calculate Total Positive Usability Score for Each Respondent:**
   - This score is the sum of 'Ease_of_Use' and 'Integration_of_Functions' for each respondent.

2. **Determine the Group of Each Respondent:**
   - Map the 'Group' answer to its corresponding text (A. Senior, B. Junior, C. Middle, D. Intern).

3. **Calculate the Average Total Positive Usability Score for Each Group, Excluding Respondents in That Group:**
   - For each group, sum the total positive usability scores of all respondents not in that group.
   - Divide this sum by the number of respondents not in that group to get the average.

4. **Compare Each Respondent's Score to the Average of the Other Groups:**
   - If a respondent's total positive usability score is lower than the average score of the respondents not in their group, count them.

Let's calculate the total positive usability score for each respondent and their group:

1. Respondent 64 (Intern): 2 + 2 = 4
2. Respondent 35 (Senior): 1 + 1 = 2
3. Respondent 47 (Junior): 4 + 5 = 9
4. Respondent 82 (Middle): 4 + 4 = 8
5. Respondent 32 (Junior): 5 + 5 = 10
6. Respondent 89 (Senior): 3 + 5 = 8
7. Respondent 61 (Junior): 2 + 1 = 3
8. Respondent 43 (Middle): 5 + 5 = 10
9. Respondent 11 (Senior): 5 + 5 = 10

**Groups and Their Respondents:**
- Senior: 35, 89, 11
- Junior: 47, 32, 61
- Middle: 82, 43
- Intern: 64

**Calculating Average Scores Excluding Each Group:**

- **For Senior (Excluding Senior):** (9 + 10 + 3 + 8 + 10 + 4) / 6 = 44 / 6 = 7.33
- **For Junior (Excluding Junior):** (2 + 8 + 10 + 8 + 10 + 4) / 6 = 42 / 6 = 7
- **For Middle (Excluding Middle):** (2 + 9 + 10 + 3 + 8 + 4) / 6 = 36 / 6 = 6
- **For Intern (Excluding Intern):** (2 + 9 + 10 + 8 + 10 + 3 + 8 + 10) / 8 = 60 / 8 = 7.5

**Comparing Scores:**

1. Respondent 64 (Intern): 4 vs 7.5 (Lower)
2. Respondent 35 (Senior): 2 vs 7.33 (Lower)
