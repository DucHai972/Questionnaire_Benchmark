<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the respondents from the 'Junior' group who rated 'Ease_of_Learning' as 5.
</task>","To answer this question, we first need to identify the respondents who belong to the 'Junior' group and then check their ratings for 'Ease_of_Learning'.

From the 'questions' section, we know that the 'Group' field is a multiple-choice question with the following options:
1. Group: Group of the respondent [MCQ: A. Senior B. Junior C. Middle D. Intern]

So, the 'Junior' group corresponds to option 'B'.

Next, we examine the 'responses' section to find respondents who belong to the 'Junior' group (option 'B') and check their 'Ease_of_Learning' ratings.

Respondent 66:
  Group: B
  ...
  Ease_of_Learning: 5

Respondent 61:

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents from the 'Senior' group who rated 'Ease_of_Learning' as 5.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to identify the respondents who belong to the 'Senior' group and then check their ratings for 'Ease_of_Learning' to see if it's 5.

From the 'questions' section, we understand that the 'Group' is categorized as follows: A. Senior, B. Junior, C. Middle, D. Intern.

Looking through the 'responses', we identify the respondents who are in the 'Senior' group (Group: A) and check their 'Ease_of_Learning' ratings.

Respondent 34: Group A, Ease_of_Learning: 2
Respondent 38: Group A, Ease_of_Learning: 4
Respondent 86: Group A, Ease_of_Learning: 5

Therefore, the count of respondents from the 'Senior' group who rated 'Ease_of_Learning' as 5 is 1.",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

We are looking for respondents in the 'Middle' group, which corresponds to option C.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who are in the 'Middle' group.
</task>","To determine the count of respondents in the 'Middle' group, we refer to the 'questions' section, which defines the groups as follows: 
""[MCQ: A. Senior B. Junior C. Middle D. Intern]"".

From the 'responses' section, we identify the respondents who belong to the 'Middle' group by looking for the group code ""C"", as that corresponds to 'Middle' according to the schema.

Respondents 22, 54, 82, and 37 are all in group ""C"", which corresponds to the 'Middle' group.

Therefore, the count of respondents in the 'Middle' group is 4.",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents from the 'Junior' group who rated 'Cumbersome_to_Use' as 4.
</task>","To answer this question, we need to identify respondents who belong to the 'Junior' group and have rated 'Cumbersome_to_Use' as 4.

From the 'questions' section, we understand that:
- The 'Group' field is a multiple-choice question with options A. Senior, B. Junior, C. Middle, D. Intern.
- The 'Cumbersome_to_Use' field is a Likert scale from 1 to 5, where 1 = Strongly Disagree and 5 = Strongly Agree, indicating how cumbersome the system was to use.

Looking at the responses:
- Respondents with 'Group: B' are in the 'Junior' group because, according to the schema, B corresponds to 'Junior'.
- We need to find respondents with 'Cumbersome_to_Use: 4', which means they found the system very awkward to use, leaning towards strong agreement.

After examining the responses:
- Respondent 24 is in the 'Middle' group (Group: C), not 'Junior', and has 'Cumbersome_to_Use: 4'.
- Respondent 84 is in the 'Intern' group (Group: D), not 'Junior', and has 'Cumbersome_to_Use: 4'.

None of the respondents in the 'Junior' group (Group: B) have rated 'Cumbersome_to_Use' as 4.

Therefore, the count of respondents from the 'Junior' group who rated 'Cumbersome_to_Use' as 4 is 0.",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose combined score for 'Frequent_Usage' and 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' is less than 5.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to calculate the combined score for 'Frequent_Usage' and 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' for each respondent and then count those whose combined score is less than 5.

Let's calculate the combined scores:

- Respondent 15: Frequent_Usage = 2, Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = 2, Combined = 2 + 2 = 4
- Respondent 17: Frequent_Usage = 5, Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = 1, Combined = 5 + 1 = 6
- Respondent 70: Frequent_Usage = 5, Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = 1, Combined = 5 + 1 = 6
- Respondent 77: Frequent_Usage = 5, Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = 1, Combined = 5 + 1 = 6
- Respondent 23: Frequent_Usage = 4, Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = 3, Combined = 4 + 3 = 7
- Respondent 29: Frequent_Usage = 4, Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = 1, Combined = 4 + 1 = 5
- Respondent 82: Frequent_Usage = 1, Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = 5, Combined = 1 + 5 = 6
- Respondent 60: Frequent_Usage = 1, Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = 2, Combined = 1 + 2 = 3

Now, let's count the respondents whose combined score is less than 5:
- Respondent 15: Combined = 4 (less than 5)
- Respondent 60: Combined = 3 (less than 5)

There are 2 respondents whose combined score for 'Frequent_Usage' and 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' is less than 5.

The final answer is: 2",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents from the 'Senior' group who rated 'Ease_of_Learning' as 4 and 'Frequent_Usage' as 2.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify respondents from the 'Senior' group.
2. Among them, find those who rated 'Ease_of_Learning' as 4.
3. Further narrow it down to those who also rated 'Frequent_Usage' as 2.

From the 'questions' section, we know:
- Group is categorized as A. Senior, B. Junior, C. Middle, D. Intern.
- 'Ease_of_Learning' and 'Frequent_Usage' are rated on a Likert scale of 1-5.

Looking at the responses:
- Respondent 46 is in group A (Senior), but their 'Ease_of_Learning' is 1 and 'Frequent_Usage' is 1, so they don't fit.
- Respondent 75 is in group A (Senior), their 'Ease_of_Learning' is 4, but 'Frequent_Usage' is 1, so they don't fit.
- Respondent 55 is in group A (Senior), their 'Ease_of_Learning' is 4, and 'Frequent_Usage' is 2, so they fit.
- Respondent 13 is in group A (Senior), but their 'Ease_of_Learning' is 5 and 'Frequent_Usage' is 3, so they don't fit.

Therefore, there is only 1 respondent from the 'Senior' group who meets the specified criteria.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents from the 'Junior' group who rated 'Cumbersome_to_Use' as 1 and 'System_Complexity' as 1.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to identify respondents who belong to the 'Junior' group, and within this group, find those who rated 'Cumbersome_to_Use' as 1 and 'System_Complexity' as 1.

From the 'questions' section, we understand that:
- The 'Group' field is a multiple-choice question with options A. Senior, B. Junior, C. Middle, D. Intern.
- 'Cumbersome_to_Use' and 'System_Complexity' are Likert scale questions rated from 1 to 5.

Looking at the responses, we identify respondents in the 'Junior' group by looking for 'Group: B' since B corresponds to 'Junior'. Then, we check their ratings for 'Cumbersome_to_Use' and 'System_Complexity'.

Respondents in the 'Junior' group are:
- Respondent 44
- Respondent 8
- Respondent 68
- Respondent 36

Now, we check each of these respondents' ratings for 'Cumbersome_to_Use' and 'System_Complexity':
- Respondent 44: 'Cumbersome_to_Use' is 1, 'System_Complexity' is 2. Does not match.
- Respondent 8: 'Cumbersome_to_Use' is 4, 'System_Complexity' is 1. Does not match.
- Respondent 68: 'Cumbersome_to_Use' is 1, 'System_Complexity' is 3. Does not match.
- Respondent 36: 'Cumbersome_to_Use' is 1, 'System_Complexity' is 1. Matches.

Therefore, there is 1 respondent from the 'Junior' group who rated 'Cumbersome_to_Use' as 1 and 'System_Complexity' as 1.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who rated 'Frequent_Usage' and 'System_Complexity' with the same score.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who have a total positive usability score ('Ease_of_Use' + 'Integration_of_Functions') that is lower than the average for all respondents not in their group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average total positive usability score for each group, excluding the respondents in that group. Then, we compare each respondent's score to the average of the other groups to determine if it's lower.

1. **Calculate Total Positive Usability Score for Each Respondent:**
   - This score is the sum of 'Ease_of_Use' and 'Integration_of_Functions' for each respondent.

2. **Calculate Average Total Positive Usability Score for Each Group, Excluding Respondents in That Group:**
   - We need to calculate the average score for respondents not in each group (A, B, C, D) separately.

3. **Compare Each Respondent's Score to the Average of the Other Groups:**
   - If a respondent's score is lower than the average score of the groups they are not part of, we count them.

**Step 1: Calculate Scores and Group Them**

- Respondent 49: Group D, Score = 5 + 5 = 10
- Respondent 43: Group C, Score = 5 + 5 = 10
- Respondent 30: Group D, Score = 5 + 5 = 10
- Respondent 22: Group C, Score = 4 + 4 = 8
- Respondent 50: Group C, Score = 5 + 5 = 10
- Respondent 74: Group D, Score = 5 + 5 = 10
- Respondent 89: Group A, Score = 3 + 5 = 8
- Respondent 37: Group C, Score = 5 + 5 = 10
- Respondent 71: Group D, Score = 5 + 4 = 9
- Respondent 36: Group B, Score = 5 + 5 = 10

**Step 2: Calculate Average Scores Excluding Each Group**

- **Group A Excluded:** Scores = [10, 10, 10, 8, 10, 10, 10, 9, 10] (excluding only Group A, but since there's only one respondent in Group A, we consider all others), Average = (10*7 + 8*2 + 9) / 10 = (70 + 16 + 9) / 10 = 95 / 10 = 9.5
- **Group B Excluded:** Scores = [10, 10, 10, 8, 10, 10, 8, 10, 10] (excluding Group B), Average = (10*7 + 8*2) / 9 = (70 + 16) / 9 = 86 / 9 = 9.555...
- **Group C Excluded:** Scores = [10, 10, 10, 8, 10, 10, 8, 10] (excluding Group C), Average = (10*6 + 8*2) / 8 = (60 + 16) / 8 = 76 / 8 = 9.5
- **Group D Excluded:** Scores = [10, 10, 8, 10, 8, 10, 10] (excluding Group D), Average = (10*5 + 8*2) / 7 = (50 + 16) / 7 = 66 / 7 = 9.428...

**Step 3: Compare Scores**

- Respondent 49 (Group D, Score = 10): Average of other groups (A, B, C) = 9.5, Score is not lower.
- Respondent 43 (Group C, Score = 10): Average of other groups (A, B, D) = 9.5, Score is not lower.
- Respondent 30 (Group D, Score = 10): Average of other groups (A, B, C) = 9.5, Score is not lower.
- Respondent 22 (Group C, Score = 8): Average of other groups (A, B, D) = 9.5, Score is lower.
- Respondent 50 (Group C, Score = 10): Average of other groups (A, B, D) = 9.5, Score is not lower.
- Respondent 74 (Group D, Score = 10): Average of other groups (A, B, C) = 9.5, Score is not lower.
- Respondent 89 (Group A, Score = 8): Average of other groups (B, C, D) = 9.555..., Score is lower.
- Respondent 37 (Group C, Score = 10): Average of other groups (A, B, D) = 9.5, Score is not lower.
- Respondent 71 (Group D, Score = 9): Average of other groups (A, B, C) = 9.5, Score is lower.
- Respondent 36 (Group B, Score = 10): Average of other groups (A, C, D) = 9.5, Score is not lower.

**Count of Respondents with Lower Score than Average of Other Groups:**

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who have a 'System_Complexity' score that is higher than the average 'System_Complexity' score for their group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'System_Complexity' score for each group and then compare each respondent's score to this average to determine if it's higher.

Given the data:

1. **Group A (Senior)**: No respondents.
2. **Group B (Junior)**: Respondents 36, 32, 14.
   - Respondent 36: System_Complexity = 1
   - Respondent 32: System_Complexity = 1
   - Respondent 14: System_Complexity = 1
   - Average System_Complexity for Group B = (1 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 1
3. **Group C (Middle)**: Respondents 82, 4, 87, 70.
   - Respondent 82: System_Complexity = 1
   - Respondent 4: System_Complexity = 1
   - Respondent 87: System_Complexity = 2
   - Respondent 70: System_Complexity = 1
   - Average System_Complexity for Group C = (1 + 1 + 2 + 1) / 4 = 1.25
4. **Group D (Intern)**: Respondents 15, 29, 18, 12.
   - Respondent 15: System_Complexity = 2
   - Respondent 29: System_Complexity = 1
   - Respondent 18: System_Complexity = 1
   - Respondent 12: System_Complexity = 2
   - Average System_Complexity for Group D = (2 + 1 + 1 + 2) / 4 = 1.5

Now, let's identify respondents with a 'System_Complexity' score higher than their group's average:

- **Group B**: All have a score of 1, which is equal to the group average. None are higher.
- **Group C**: The average is 1.25. Respondent 87 has a score of 2, which is higher than the average.
- **Group D**: The average is 1.5. Respondents 15 and 12 have scores of 2, which is higher than the average.

Therefore, the respondents who have a 'System_Complexity' score higher than the average for their group are:

- Respondent 87 (Group C)
- Respondent 15 (Group D)
- Respondent 12 (Group D)

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who have a total positive usability score ('Ease_of_Use' + 'Integration_of_Functions') that is lower than the average for all respondents not in their group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average total positive usability score for each group, excluding the respondents in the group being considered. Then, we compare each respondent's score to the average of the other groups to determine if it's lower.

1. **Calculate Total Positive Usability Score for Each Respondent:**
   - This score is the sum of 'Ease_of_Use' and 'Integration_of_Functions' for each respondent.

2. **Calculate Average Total Positive Usability Score for Each Group (Excluding Respondents in the Group):**
   - For each group, calculate the average score of all respondents not in that group.

3. **Compare Each Respondent's Score to the Average of the Other Groups:**
   - Count respondents whose score is lower than the average of the groups they are not part of.

Let's calculate:

### Step 1: Calculate Total Positive Usability Scores

- Respondent 5: 5 (Ease_of_Use) + 5 (Integration_of_Functions) = 10
- Respondent 37: 5 + 5 = 10
- Respondent 90: 5 + 5 = 10
- Respondent 19: 5 + 3 = 8
- Respondent 60: 5 + 4 = 9
- Respondent 48: 5 + 5 = 10
- Respondent 86: 1 + 5 = 6
- Respondent 13: 5 + 5 = 10
- Respondent 59: 5 + 5 = 10
- Respondent 77: 5 + 4 = 9
- Respondent 64: 2 + 2 = 4
- Respondent 78: 3 + 4 = 7

### Step 2: Determine Group for Each Respondent

- Respondent 5: C
- Respondent 37: C
- Respondent 90: D
- Respondent 19: C
- Respondent 60: D
- Respondent 48: D
- Respondent 86: A
- Respondent 13: A
- Respondent 59: A
- Respondent 77: D
- Respondent 64: D
- Respondent 78: D

### Step 3: Calculate Average Scores for Each Group (Excluding Respondents in the Group)

- **Group A (Respondents 86, 13, 59):** Excluding these, average of others = (10+10+10+8+9+10+9+4+7) / 9 = 77 / 9 ≈ 8.56
- **Group C (Respondents 5, 37, 19):** Excluding these, average of others = (10+9+10+6+10+10+9+4+7) / 9 = 75 / 9 ≈ 8.33
- **Group D (Respondents 90, 60, 48, 77, 64, 78):** Excluding these, average of others = (10+10+8+6+10+10) / 6 = 54 / 6 = 9

### Step 4: Compare Scores

- **For Group A (Average of others ≈ 8.56):**
  - Respondent 86: 6 < 8.56
  - Respondent 13: 10 > 8.56
  - Respondent 59: 10 > 8.56
- **For Group C (Average of others ≈ 8.33):**
  - Respondent 5: 10 > 8.33
  - Respondent 37: 10 > 8.33
  - Respondent 19: 8 < 8.33
- **For Group D (Average of others = 9):**
  - Respondent 90: 10 > 9
  - Respondent 60: 9 = 9 (not lower)
  - Respondent 48: 10 > 9
  - Respondent 77: 9 = 9 (not lower)
  - Respondent 64: 4 < 9
  - Respondent 78: 7 < 9

### Count Respondents with Lower Scores

- Respondent 86
- Respondent 19
- Respondent 64
- Respondent 78

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who have a 'Integration_of_Functions' score that is higher than the average 'Integration_of_Functions' score for their group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Integration_of_Functions' score for each group and then compare each respondent's score to this average to determine if it's higher.

From the 'questions' section, we understand that 'Integration_of_Functions' is scored on a Likert scale of 1-5.

Let's calculate the average 'Integration_of_Functions' score for each group based on the 'responses' section:

1. Group A (Senior):
   - Respondent 67: Integration_of_Functions = 5
   - Since there's only one respondent in Group A, the average is 5.

2. Group B (Junior):
   - Respondent 23: Integration_of_Functions = 4
   - Since there's only one respondent in Group B, the average is 4.

3. Group C (Middle):
   - Respondent 53: Integration_of_Functions = 5
   - Respondent 70: Integration_of_Functions = 5
   - Average for Group C = (5 + 5) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5

4. Group D (Intern):
   - Respondent 90: Integration_of_Functions = 5
   - Respondent 15: Integration_of_Functions = 5
   - Respondent 49: Integration_of_Functions = 5
   - Respondent 29: Integration_of_Functions = 4
   - Average for Group D = (5 + 5 + 5 + 4) / 4 = 19 / 4 = 4.75

Now, let's identify respondents whose 'Integration_of_Functions' score is higher than their group's average:

1. Group A: Since the average is 5, and Respondent 67 has a score of 5, this respondent does not have a score higher than the average.

2. Group B: The average is 4, and Respondent 23 has a score of 4, so this respondent does not have a score higher than the average.

3. Group C: The average is 5, and both Respondent 53 and Respondent 70 have scores of 5. Neither of these respondents has a score higher than the average.

4. Group D: The average is 4.75. Respondents 90, 15, and 49 have scores of 5, which is higher than the average. Respondent 29 has a score of 4, which is not higher than the average.

Therefore, the respondents who have an 'Integration_of_Functions' score higher than the average for their group are Respondents 90, 15, and 49.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who have a 'Confidence_in_Use' score that is higher than the average 'Confidence_in_Use' score for their group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Confidence_in_Use' score for each group and then compare each respondent's score to their group's average.

From the 'questions' section, we understand that 'Group' is categorized as A. Senior, B. Junior, C. Middle, D. Intern, and 'Confidence_in_Use' is scored from 1 to 5.

Let's calculate the average 'Confidence_in_Use' score for each group based on the 'responses' section:

1. Group A (Senior):
   - Respondent 35: Confidence_in_Use = 1
   - Respondent 11: Confidence_in_Use = 3
   Average for Group A = (1 + 3) / 2 = 2

2. Group B (Junior):
   - Respondent 44: Confidence_in_Use = 1
   - Respondent 3: Confidence_in_Use = 5
   Average for Group B = (1 + 5) / 2 = 3

3. Group C (Middle):
   - Respondent 54: Confidence_in_Use = 4
   - Respondent 63: Confidence_in_Use = 5
   - Respondent 33: Confidence_in_Use = 4
   - Respondent 39: Confidence_in_Use = 4
   - Respondent 62: Confidence_in_Use = 5
   Average for Group C = (4 + 5 + 4 + 4 + 5) / 5 = 4.4

4. Group D (Intern):
   - Respondent 10: Confidence_in_Use = 5
   Since there's only one respondent in Group D, the average is 5.

Now, let's identify respondents with a 'Confidence_in_Use' score higher than their group's average:

1. Group A: None, since both scores are at or below the average.
2. Group B: Respondent 3, with a score of 5, which is higher than the group average of 3.
3. Group C: Respondent 63 and Respondent 62, both with a score of 5, which is higher than the group average of 4.4.
4. Group D: Since the average is 5 and Respondent 10 has a score of 5, they are not above the average.

Counting these respondents gives us a total of 3 respondents who have a 'Confidence_in_Use' score higher than the average for their group.

<task>
Count the respondents who have a 'Integration_of_Functions' score that is higher than the average 'Integration_of_Functions' score for their group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Integration_of_Functions' score for each group and then compare each respondent's score to this average to determine if it's higher.

From the 'questions' section, we understand that 'Integration_of_Functions' is scored on a Likert scale of 1-5.

Let's calculate the average 'Integration_of_Functions' score for each group based on the provided responses:

1. Group A:
   - Respondent 52: 4
   - Respondent 6: 5
   - Respondent 76: 4
   - Respondent 67: 5
   Average for Group A = (4 + 5 + 4 + 5) / 4 = 18 / 4 = 4.5

2. Group C:
   - Respondent 82: 4
   - Respondent 20: 4
   Average for Group C = (4 + 4) / 2 = 8 / 2 = 4

3. Group D:
   - Respondent 10: 5
   - Respondent 30: 5
   Average for Group D = (5 + 5) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5

Now, let's identify respondents with 'Integration_of_Functions' scores higher than their group's average:

1. Group A (Average = 4.5):
   - None of the respondents have a score higher than 4.5, but Respondent 6 and Respondent 67 have a score of 5, which is higher than the average of 4.5 when considering the actual calculation allows for scores to be exactly at or slightly above the average due to the discrete nature of the scale. However, strictly speaking, no one has a score ""higher"" than 4.5 since the highest score achievable is 5, and several respondents achieved this. The instruction, however, implies a comparison where scores exactly at the average are not considered ""higher."" Thus, technically, no respondents in Group A have a score ""higher"" than the group average if we interpret ""higher"" as strictly above the average value.

2. Group C (Average = 4):
   - No respondents have a score higher than 4.

3. Group D (Average = 5):
   - No respondents have a score higher than 5.

Given the strict interpretation of ""higher"" as being above the average, not at or equal to it, and recognizing the misunderstanding in the initial analysis regarding Group A's comparison:

The correct count of respondents with 'Integration_of_Functions' scores strictly higher than their group's average is 0, since no one scored above the exact average of their group when considering the definition of ""higher"" as strictly greater than, not greater than or equal to.",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents in the 'Junior' group who have a 'Cumbersome_to_Use' score that is higher than the average 'Cumbersome_to_Use' for the 'Middle' group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Cumbersome_to_Use' score for the 'Middle' group and then identify the respondents in the 'Junior' group who have a 'Cumbersome_to_Use' score higher than this average.

1. **Identify 'Middle' group respondents and their 'Cumbersome_to_Use' scores:**
   - Respondent 9: Group C (Middle), Cumbersome_to_Use: 3
   - Respondent 33: Group C (Middle), Cumbersome_to_Use: 1
   - Respondent 50: Group C (Middle), Cumbersome_to_Use: 2
   - Respondent 51: Group C (Middle), Cumbersome_to_Use: 1

2. **Calculate the average 'Cumbersome_to_Use' score for the 'Middle' group:**
   - Average = (3 + 1 + 2 + 1) / 4 = 7 / 4 = 1.75

3. **Identify 'Junior' group respondents and their 'Cumbersome_to_Use' scores:**
   - Respondent 44: Group B (Junior), Cumbersome_to_Use: 1
   - Respondent 66: Group B (Junior), Cumbersome_to_Use: 1
   - Respondent 79: Group B (Junior), Cumbersome_to_Use: 1

4. **Count the 'Junior' group respondents with a 'Cumbersome_to_Use' score higher than the 'Middle' group average (1.75):**
   - None of the 'Junior' group respondents have a 'Cumbersome_to_Use' score higher than 1.75.

Therefore, the count of respondents in the 'Junior' group who have a 'Cumbersome_to_Use' score higher than the average 'Cumbersome_to_Use' for the 'Middle' group is 0.",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who have a 'Ease_of_Use' score that is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score for their group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Ease_of_Use' score for each group and then compare each respondent's score to this average to determine if it's higher.

From the 'questions' section, we understand that 'Ease_of_Use' is scored on a Likert scale of 1-5, where 1 = Strongly Disagree and 5 = Strongly Agree, in relation to the statement ""I thought the system was easy to use.""

Let's calculate the average 'Ease_of_Use' score for each group based on the provided responses:

1. **Group A (Senior):**
   - Respondent 72: Ease_of_Use = 5
   - Respondent 65: Ease_of_Use = 5
   - Average for Group A = (5 + 5) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5

2. **Group B (Junior):**
   - Respondent 69: Ease_of_Use = 5
   - Since there's only one respondent in Group B, the average = 5

3. **Group C (Middle):**
   - Respondent 17: Ease_of_Use = 5
   - Respondent 39: Ease_of_Use = 1
   - Average for Group C = (5 + 1) / 2 = 6 / 2 = 3

4. **Group D (Intern):**
   - Respondent 71: Ease_of_Use = 5
   - Respondent 41: Ease_of_Use = 5
   - Respondent 25: Ease_of_Use = 3
   - Average for Group D = (5 + 5 + 3) / 3 = 13 / 3 = 4.33

Now, let's identify respondents whose 'Ease_of_Use' score is higher than their group's average:

- **Group A:** Both respondents have a score of 5, which is equal to the group average. None are higher.
- **Group B:** The single respondent has a score of 5, which is equal to the group average. None are higher.
- **Group C:** Respondent 17 has a score of 5, which is higher than the group average of 3. Respondent 39 has a score of 1, which is lower than the group average.
- **Group D:** Respondents 71 and 41 have scores of 5, which are higher than the group average of 4.33. Respondent 25 has a score of 3, which is lower than the group average.

Therefore, the respondents with an 'Ease_of_Use' score higher than their group's average are:

- Respondent 17 (Group C)
- Respondent 71 (Group D)
- Respondent 41 (Group D)

Count of such respondents = 3",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who have a 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score that is higher than the average 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score for their group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score for each group and then compare each respondent's score to this average to determine if it's higher.

Given the data:

1. Respondent 9: Group C, Need_for_Technical_Support = 5
2. Respondent 45: Group D, Need_for_Technical_Support = 1
3. Respondent 53: Group C, Need_for_Technical_Support = 1
4. Respondent 15: Group D, Need_for_Technical_Support = 1
5. Respondent 42: Group A, Need_for_Technical_Support = 5
6. Respondent 71: Group D, Need_for_Technical_Support = 1
7. Respondent 66: Group B, Need_for_Technical_Support = 1
8. Respondent 7: Group D, Need_for_Technical_Support = 1
9. Respondent 88: Group C, Need_for_Technical_Support = 2
10. Respondent 6: Group A, Need_for_Technical_Support = 1
11. Respondent 36: Group B, Need_for_Technical_Support = 1

Let's calculate the average 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score for each group:

- Group A: (5 + 1) / 2 = 3
- Group B: (1 + 1) / 2 = 1
- Group C: (5 + 1 + 2) / 3 = 8 / 3 = 2.67
- Group D: (1 + 1 + 1 + 1) / 4 = 4 / 4 = 1

Now, let's identify respondents with a 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score higher than their group's average:

1. Respondent 9 (Group C, score = 5): 5 > 2.67, so yes.
2. Respondent 45 (Group D, score = 1): 1 = 1, so no.
3. Respondent 53 (Group C, score = 1): 1 < 2.67, so no.
4. Respondent 15 (Group D, score = 1): 1 = 1, so no.
5. Respondent 42 (Group A, score = 5): 5 > 3, so yes.
6. Respondent 71 (Group D, score = 1): 1 = 1, so no.
7. Respondent 66 (Group B, score = 1): 1 = 1, so no.
8. Respondent 7 (Group D, score = 1): 1 = 1, so no.
9. Respondent 88 (Group C, score = 2): 2 < 2.67, so no.
10. Respondent 6 (Group A, score = 1): 1 < 3, so no.
11. Respondent 36 (Group B, score = 1): 1 = 1, so no.

Count of respondents with a 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score higher than their group's average: 2

<task>
Count the respondents who have a total positive usability score ('Ease_of_Use' + 'Integration_of_Functions') that is lower than the average for all respondents not in their group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the total positive usability score for each respondent, which is the sum of 'Ease_of_Use' and 'Integration_of_Functions'. Then, we calculate the average of this score for all respondents not in each respondent's group. Finally, we compare each respondent's score with the average score of the other groups and count those who have a lower score.

1. Calculate the total positive usability score for each respondent:
   - Respondent 64: 2 (Ease_of_Use) + 2 (Integration_of_Functions) = 4
   - Respondent 35: 1 + 1 = 2
   - Respondent 47: 4 + 5 = 9

   - Respondent 61: 2 + 1 = 3
   - Respondent 43: 5 + 5 = 10
   - Respondent 11: 5 + 5 = 10

2. Identify the group of each respondent:
   - Respondent 64: D (Intern)
   - Respondent 35: A (Senior)
   - Respondent 47: B (Junior)
   - Respondent 82: C (Middle)

   - Respondent 89: A (Senior)
   - Respondent 61: B (Junior)
   - Respondent 43: C (Middle)
   - Respondent 11: A (Senior)

3. Calculate the average total positive usability score for each group (excluding the group being considered for each respondent):
   - For Respondent 64 (D), average of A, B, C: (2+9+8+10+8+3+10+10)/7 = 60/7 ≈ 8.57
   - For Respondent 35 (A), average of B, C, D: (9+8+10+10+3+10)/6 = 50/6 ≈ 8.33
   - For Respondent 47 (B), average of A, C, D: (2+8+8+10+10+10)/6 = 48/6 = 8
   - For Respondent 82 (C), average of A, B, D: (2+9+10+3+10+10)/6 = 44/6 ≈ 7.33
   - For Respondent 32 (B), average of A, C, D: (2+8+8+10+10+10)/6 = 48/6 = 8
   - For Respondent 89 (A), average of B, C, D: (9+8+10+3+10+10)/6 = 50/6 ≈ 8.33
   - For Respondent 61 (B), average of A, C, D: (2+8+8+10+10+10)/6 = 48/6 = 8
