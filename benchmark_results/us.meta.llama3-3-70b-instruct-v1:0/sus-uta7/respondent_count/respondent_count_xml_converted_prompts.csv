</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who are in the 'Middle' group.
</task>","To determine the count of respondents in the 'Middle' group, we first need to identify the corresponding code for 'Middle' in the provided schema. According to the schema for the question ""Group of the respondent [MCQ: A. Senior B. Junior C. Middle D. Intern]"", 'Middle' is represented by the code ""C"".

Next, we examine the responses to find all instances where the answer to the ""Group"" question is ""C"" (case-insensitive), as this indicates the respondent is in the 'Middle' group.

From the provided data:
- Respondent 22 has an answer of ""C"" for the ""Group"" question.
- Respondent 40 has an answer of ""C"" for the ""Group"" question.
- Respondent 33 has an answer of ""C"" for the ""Group"" question.

Therefore, there are 3 respondents who are in the 'Middle' group. 

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$",True

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the respondents from the 'Junior' group who rated 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' as 1.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to identify the respondents who belong to the 'Junior' group and then check their ratings for the 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' question.

From the 'questions' section, we understand that the 'Group' question is a multiple-choice question with options:
- A. Senior
- B. Junior
- C. Middle
- D. Intern

We are looking for respondents who answered 'B' (Junior) to the 'Group' question and rated '1' for 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use'.

Looking through the 'responses' section:

1. Respondent 31: Group = D (Intern), not Junior.
2. Respondent 39: Group = C (Middle), not Junior.
3. Respondent 14: Group = B (Junior), and Need_to_Learn_Before_Use = 3, not 1.
4. Respondent 51: Group = C (Middle), not Junior.
5. Respondent 62: Group = C (Middle), not Junior.
6. Respondent 20: Group = C (Middle), not Junior.

However, upon re-examining the data provided for a respondent who is in the 'Junior' group and rated 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' as 1, we find:

- Respondent 31 is actually in the 'Intern' group, not 'Junior', and their 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' rating is 1.
- Respondent 51 is in the 'Middle' group, not 'Junior', but their 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' rating is 1.
- Respondent 62 is in the 'Middle' group, not 'Junior', but their 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' rating is 1.

The only respondent who is in the 'Junior' group is Respondent 14, but they rated 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' as 3, not 1.

Therefore, based on the provided data, there are no respondents from the 'Junior' group who rated 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' as 1.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the respondents from the 'Intern' group who rated 'Inconsistency' as 1.
</task>","To answer this question, we first need to identify the respondents who are in the 'Intern' group and then check their ratings for 'Inconsistency'.

From the 'questions' section, we understand that the 'Group' question is a multiple-choice question with options A. Senior, B. Junior, C. Middle, D. Intern. The 'Inconsistency' question is a Likert scale question with ratings from 1 to 5.

Looking at the 'responses' section, we can identify the respondents who are in the 'Intern' group by looking for answers to the 'Group' question that are 'D'. Then, we check their answers to the 'Inconsistency' question to see if they rated it as 1.

The respondents in the 'Intern' group are:
- Respondent 30: Rated 'Inconsistency' as 1
- Respondent 48: Rated 'Inconsistency' as 1
- Respondent 49: Rated 'Inconsistency' as 4 (does not meet the criteria)
- Respondent 25: Rated 'Inconsistency' as 4 (does not meet the criteria)

Therefore, the number of respondents from the 'Intern' group who rated 'Inconsistency' as 1 is 2.",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents from the 'Junior' group who rated 'Ease_of_Learning' as 5.
</task>","To answer this question, we first need to identify the respondents who belong to the 'Junior' group and then check their ratings for 'Ease_of_Learning'.

From the 'questions' section, we understand that the 'Group' question is a multiple-choice question with options:
- A. Senior
- B. Junior
- C. Middle
- D. Intern

We are interested in respondents who selected 'B. Junior'.

For 'Ease_of_Learning', the question is rated on a Likert scale of 1-5, where 5 means the respondent strongly agrees that most people would learn to use the system very quickly.

Now, let's examine the 'responses' section to find respondents who are in the 'Junior' group and rated 'Ease_of_Learning' as 5.

Respondents with 'Group' = 'B' (Junior) are:
- Respondent id=""66""
- Respondent id=""61""

Checking their 'Ease_of_Learning' ratings:
- Respondent id=""66"" rated 'Ease_of_Learning' as 5.
- Respondent id=""61"" rated 'Ease_of_Learning' as 2.

Therefore, only 1 respondent from the 'Junior' group rated 'Ease_of_Learning' as 5.

The final answer is: 1",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents from the 'Senior' group who rated 'Ease_of_Learning' as 5.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to identify the respondents who belong to the 'Senior' group and then check which of these respondents rated 'Ease_of_Learning' as 5.

From the 'questions' section, we understand that the 'Group' question is a multiple-choice question with options A. Senior, B. Junior, C. Middle, D. Intern. Therefore, respondents who belong to the 'Senior' group will have answered 'A' (or 'a', since the response is case-insensitive) to the 'Group' question.

Next, we look at the 'responses' section to find respondents who are in the 'Senior' group and check their answers to the 'Ease_of_Learning' question.

Respondents in the 'Senior' group are those with 'Group' answer 'A' or 'a'. Let's list them out based on the provided data:
- Respondent 34: Group = A, Ease_of_Learning = 2
- Respondent 38: Group = A, Ease_of_Learning = 4
- Respondent 86: Group = A, Ease_of_Learning = 5

From the above, only Respondent 86 is in the 'Senior' group and rated 'Ease_of_Learning' as 5.

Therefore, the count of respondents from the 'Senior' group who rated 'Ease_of_Learning' as 5 is 1.",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents from the 'Intern' group who rated 'Frequent_Usage' as 4.
</task>","To answer this question, we first need to identify the respondents who belong to the 'Intern' group and then check their ratings for 'Frequent_Usage'.

From the 'questions' section, we understand that the 'Group' question is a multiple-choice question with options:
- A. Senior
- B. Junior
- C. Middle
- D. Intern

We are looking for respondents who answered 'D' (which corresponds to 'Intern') for the 'Group' question and rated '4' for 'Frequent_Usage'.

Looking through the 'responses' section:

- Respondent 31 is in the 'Intern' group (since their answer for 'Group' is 'D') and rated 'Frequent_Usage' as '2', not '4'. 

There are no other respondents in the 'Intern' group who rated 'Frequent_Usage' as '4'.

Therefore, the count of respondents from the 'Intern' group who rated 'Frequent_Usage' as '4' is 0.",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents from the 'Junior' group who rated 'Confidence_in_Use' as 3.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the respondents who belong to the 'Junior' group.
2. Among those, count the ones who rated 'Confidence_in_Use' as 3.

From the 'questions' section, we understand that the 'Group' question is a multiple-choice question with the following options:
- A. Senior
- B. Junior
- C. Middle
- D. Intern

We are looking for respondents who answered 'B' (Junior) to the 'Group' question.

Next, we examine the 'responses' section to find respondents who are in the 'Junior' group and see how they rated 'Confidence_in_Use'.

Respondents in the 'Junior' group are those with 'B' as their answer to the 'Group' question:
- Respondent 16: B
- Respondent 26: B

Now, we check how these respondents rated 'Confidence_in_Use':
- Respondent 16 rated 'Confidence_in_Use' as 5.
- Respondent 26 rated 'Confidence_in_Use' as 4.

None of the respondents in the 'Junior' group rated 'Confidence_in_Use' as 3.

Therefore, the count of respondents from the 'Junior' group who rated 'Confidence_in_Use' as 3 is 0.",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who are in the 'Senior' group.
</task>","To determine the count of respondents in the 'Senior' group, we need to look at the answers for the question ""Group"" in the 'responses' section and match them with the corresponding group name from the 'questions' schema.

The schema for the ""Group"" question is:
""[MCQ: A. Senior B. Junior C. Middle D. Intern]""

This means:
- A corresponds to ""Senior""
- B corresponds to ""Junior""
- C corresponds to ""Middle""
- D corresponds to ""Intern""

Looking through the responses:
- Respondent 87: C (Middle)
- Respondent 6: A (Senior)
- Respondent 67: A (Senior)
- Respondent 16: B (Junior)
- Respondent 66: B (Junior)
- Respondent 26: B (Junior)
- Respondent 51: C (Middle)
- Respondent 45: D (Intern)
- Respondent 68: B (Junior)
- Respondent 38: A (Senior)
- Respondent 75: A (Senior)
- Respondent 19: C (Middle)

Counting the respondents who are in the 'Senior' group (A):
- Respondent 6
- Respondent 67
- Respondent 38
- Respondent 75

There are 4 respondents who are in the 'Senior' group.",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents from the 'Middle' group who rated 'Ease_of_Use' as 3.
</task>","To answer this question, we first need to identify the respondents who belong to the 'Middle' group and then check their ratings for 'Ease_of_Use' to find those who rated it as 3.

From the 'questions' section, we understand that the 'Group' question is a multiple-choice question with options:
- A. Senior
- B. Junior
- C. Middle
- D. Intern

We are interested in the 'Middle' group, which corresponds to option 'C'.

Next, we look at the 'responses' section to find respondents who belong to the 'Middle' group (those who answered 'C' to the 'Group' question) and see how they rated 'Ease_of_Use'.

Respondents who belong to the 'Middle' group are:
- Respondent 88 (Group: C)
- Respondent 20 (Group: C)
- Respondent 87 (Group: C)
- Respondent 82 (Group: C)
- Respondent 22 (Group: C)

Now, we check their ratings for 'Ease_of_Use':
- Respondent 88 rated 'Ease_of_Use' as 5.
- Respondent 20 rated 'Ease_of_Use' as 5.
- Respondent 87 rated 'Ease_of_Use' as 3.
- Respondent 82 rated 'Ease_of_Use' as 4.
- Respondent 22 rated 'Ease_of_Use' as 4.

Only Respondent 87 rated 'Ease_of_Use' as 3.

Therefore, the count of respondents from the 'Middle' group who rated 'Ease_of_Use' as 3 is 1.",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the respondents from the 'Junior' group who rated 'Cumbersome_to_Use' as 4.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to identify the respondents who belong to the 'Junior' group and then check their ratings for 'Cumbersome_to_Use'.

From the 'questions' section, we understand that the 'Group' question is a multiple-choice question with options:
- A. Senior
- B. Junior
- C. Middle
- D. Intern

We are looking for respondents who answered 'B' (Junior) to the 'Group' question and rated '4' for 'Cumbersome_to_Use'.

Looking through the 'responses' section:

- Respondent 32 is in group 'B' (Junior) and rated 'Cumbersome_to_Use' as 1.
- Respondent 79 is in group 'B' (Junior) and rated 'Cumbersome_to_Use' as 1.
- Respondent 16 is in group 'B' (Junior) and rated 'Cumbersome_to_Use' as 1.

None of these respondents rated 'Cumbersome_to_Use' as 4. However, we need to check all respondents to ensure accuracy.

Upon reviewing all respondents:
- Respondent 24 is in group 'C' (Middle) and rated 'Cumbersome_to_Use' as 4, but is not in the 'Junior' group.
- Respondent 84 is in group 'D' (Intern) and rated 'Cumbersome_to_Use' as 4, but is not in the 'Junior' group.

There are no respondents in the 'Junior' group who rated 'Cumbersome_to_Use' as 4.

The final answer is: 0",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose combined score for 'Ease_of_Use' and 'System_Complexity' is less than 6.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to iterate through each respondent's answers in the 'responses' section, find the scores for 'Ease_of_Use' and 'System_Complexity', add these scores together, and then check if the sum is less than 6. We will count each respondent who meets this condition.

From the provided data:

1. Respondent 26: 'Ease_of_Use' = 4, 'System_Complexity' = 2, Sum = 6
2. Respondent 85: 'Ease_of_Use' = 5, 'System_Complexity' = 1, Sum = 6
3. Respondent 27: 'Ease_of_Use' = 2, 'System_Complexity' = 4, Sum = 6
4. Respondent 56: 'Ease_of_Use' = 4, 'System_Complexity' = 2, Sum = 6
5. Respondent 77: 'Ease_of_Use' = 5, 'System_Complexity' = 1, Sum = 6

None of the respondents have a combined score for 'Ease_of_Use' and 'System_Complexity' that is less than 6. All of them have a sum of 6.

The final answer is: 0",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents from the 'Intern' group who rated 'System_Complexity' as 2 and 'Integration_of_Functions' as 5.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify respondents who are in the 'Intern' group.
2. Among those, identify respondents who rated 'System_Complexity' as 2.
3. Among those identified in step 2, count respondents who also rated 'Integration_of_Functions' as 5.

From the provided data:

- Respondents in the 'Intern' group have the answer ""D"" for the question ""Group"".
- We need to find respondents with ""D"" as the answer for ""Group"", and then check their answers for 'System_Complexity' and 'Integration_of_Functions'.

Respondents with ""D"" as the answer for ""Group"" are:
- Respondent id=""84""
- Respondent id=""90""

Now, checking their answers for 'System_Complexity' and 'Integration_of_Functions':

- Respondent id=""84"": 'System_Complexity' = 3, 'Integration_of_Functions' = 4. This respondent does not meet the criteria.
- Respondent id=""90"": 'System_Complexity' = 1, 'Integration_of_Functions' = 5. This respondent does not meet the criteria for 'System_Complexity'.

Since neither of the 'Intern' group respondents meets both criteria ('System_Complexity' as 2 and 'Integration_of_Functions' as 5), the count is 0.",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who rated 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' and 'Inconsistency' with the same score.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to iterate through each respondent's answers and compare the scores for 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' and 'Inconsistency'. We then count the number of respondents where these two scores are the same.

After analyzing the provided data:

- Respondent 71: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 1, 'Inconsistency' = 2 (Different)
- Respondent 10: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 2, 'Inconsistency' = 1 (Different)
- Respondent 45: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 1, 'Inconsistency' = 1 (Same)
- Respondent 77: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 1, 'Inconsistency' = 1 (Same)
- Respondent 78: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 5, 'Inconsistency' = 4 (Different)
- Respondent 37: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 1, 'Inconsistency' = 1 (Same)
- Respondent 12: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 2, 'Inconsistency' = 2 (Same)
- Respondent 66: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 2, 'Inconsistency' = 2 (Same)
- Respondent 51: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 1, 'Inconsistency' = 1 (Same)
- Respondent 54: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 1, 'Inconsistency' = 1 (Same)
- Respondent 3: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 2, 'Inconsistency' = 4 (Different)

Counting the respondents where 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' and 'Inconsistency' have the same score gives us a total of 8 respondents.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents from the 'Middle' group who rated 'System_Complexity' as 3 and 'Inconsistency' as 1.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to follow the instructions carefully.

First, we identify the relevant information from the 'questions' section:
- The ""Group"" question has options A. Senior, B. Junior, C. Middle, D. Intern.
- The ""System_Complexity"" question is rated on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.
- The ""Inconsistency"" question is also rated on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.

We are looking for respondents who are in the 'Middle' group, which corresponds to option C, and who rated 'System_Complexity' as 3 and 'Inconsistency' as 1.

From the 'responses' section, we examine each respondent's answers:
- Respondent 2: Group = C (Middle), System_Complexity = 1, Inconsistency = 1. Does not match because System_Complexity is not 3.
- Respondent 61: Group = B (Junior), does not match because Group is not Middle.
- Respondent 15: Group = D (Intern), does not match because Group is not Middle.
- Respondent 51: Group = C (Middle), System_Complexity = 1, Inconsistency = 1. Does not match because System_Complexity is not 3.
- Respondent 19: Group = C (Middle), System_Complexity = 1, Inconsistency = 1. Does not match because System_Complexity is not 3.
- Respondent 88: Group = C (Middle), System_Complexity = 2, Inconsistency = 3. Does not match because both System_Complexity and Inconsistency do not match the criteria.
- Respondent 6: Group = A (Senior), does not match because Group is not Middle.
- Respondent 18: Group = D (Intern), does not match because Group is not Middle.
- Respondent 69: Group = B (Junior), does not match because Group is not Middle.

Upon reviewing all respondents, none match the criteria of being in the 'Middle' group and rating 'System_Complexity' as 3 and 'Inconsistency' as 1.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose combined score for 'Cumbersome_to_Use' and 'System_Complexity' is less than 4.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to iterate through each respondent's answers in the 'responses' section and check their scores for 'Cumbersome_to_Use' and 'System_Complexity'. We then sum these scores and check if the total is less than 4. If it is, we count this respondent.

Let's examine the data:

1. Respondent 74: 'Cumbersome_to_Use' = 1, 'System_Complexity' = 1. Total = 2, which is less than 4.
2. Respondent 22: 'Cumbersome_to_Use' = 2, 'System_Complexity' = 2. Total = 4, which is not less than 4.
3. Respondent 81: 'Cumbersome_to_Use' = 2, 'System_Complexity' = 1. Total = 3, which is less than 4.
4. Respondent 30: 'Cumbersome_to_Use' = 1, 'System_Complexity' = 1. Total = 2, which is less than 4.
5. Respondent 36: 'Cumbersome_to_Use' = 1, 'System_Complexity' = 1. Total = 2, which is less than 4.
6. Respondent 62: 'Cumbersome_to_Use' = 1, 'System_Complexity' = 1. Total = 2, which is less than 4.
7. Respondent 84: 'Cumbersome_to_Use' = 4, 'System_Complexity' = 3. Total = 7, which is not less than 4.
8. Respondent 69: 'Cumbersome_to_Use' = 1, 'System_Complexity' = 4. Total = 5, which is not less than 4.

From the given data, the respondents whose combined score for 'Cumbersome_to_Use' and 'System_Complexity' is less than 4 are:

- Respondent 74
- Respondent 81
- Respondent 30
- Respondent 36
- Respondent 62

There are 5 respondents whose combined score is less than 4. 

The final answer is: 5",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents from the 'Senior' group who rated 'Ease_of_Learning' as 4 and 'Frequent_Usage' as 2.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify respondents from the 'Senior' group.
2. Filter those who rated 'Ease_of_Learning' as 4.
3. Further filter those who rated 'Frequent_Usage' as 2.

From the provided data, we first identify the 'Senior' group respondents. According to the schema, 'A' corresponds to 'Senior'. So, we look for respondents with 'Group' answer as 'A'.

Respondents with 'Group' as 'A' are:
- Respondent id=""46""
- Respondent id=""75""
- Respondent id=""55""
- Respondent id=""13""

Next, we filter those who rated 'Ease_of_Learning' as 4:
- Respondent id=""75"" has 'Ease_of_Learning' as 4.
- Respondent id=""55"" does not have 'Ease_of_Learning' as 4, it's actually 4 but we need to check 'Frequent_Usage' as well.
- Respondent id=""46"" has 'Ease_of_Learning' as 1.
- Respondent id=""13"" has 'Ease_of_Learning' as 5.

Then, we check 'Frequent_Usage' as 2 for those who passed the previous filter:
- Respondent id=""75"" has 'Frequent_Usage' as 1, not 2.
- Respondent id=""55"" has 'Frequent_Usage' as 2, which matches our criteria.

Therefore, the count of respondents from the 'Senior' group who rated 'Ease_of_Learning' as 4 and 'Frequent_Usage' as 2 is 1.",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents from the 'Junior' group who rated 'Cumbersome_to_Use' as 1 and 'System_Complexity' as 1.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to follow the instructions carefully.

First, we identify the relevant questions and their codes from the 'questions' section:
- The question about the group of the respondent is coded as ""Group"" with options ""[MCQ: A. Senior B. Junior C. Middle D. Intern]"".
- The question about the system being cumbersome to use is coded as ""Cumbersome_to_Use"".
- The question about the system complexity is coded as ""System_Complexity"".

Next, we look at the 'responses' section to find respondents who belong to the 'Junior' group, which corresponds to option ""B"". We then check if these respondents rated 'Cumbersome_to_Use' as 1 and 'System_Complexity' as 1.

From the provided data:
- Respondent ""44"" is in the ""Junior"" group (B), rated 'Cumbersome_to_Use' as 1, and 'System_Complexity' as 2. This respondent does not meet the criteria because their 'System_Complexity' rating is not 1.
- Respondent ""8"" is in the ""Junior"" group (B), rated 'Cumbersome_to_Use' as 4, and 'System_Complexity' as 1. This respondent does not meet the criteria because their 'Cumbersome_to_Use' rating is not 1.
- Respondent ""68"" is in the ""Junior"" group (B), rated 'Cumbersome_to_Use' as 1, and 'System_Complexity' as 3. This respondent does not meet the criteria because their 'System_Complexity' rating is not 1.
- Respondent ""36"" is in the ""Junior"" group (B), rated 'Cumbersome_to_Use' as 1, and 'System_Complexity' as 1. This respondent meets the criteria.

Therefore, there is 1 respondent from the 'Junior' group who rated 'Cumbersome_to_Use' as 1 and 'System_Complexity' as 1.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who rated 'Ease_of_Learning' and 'Inconsistency' with the same score.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to iterate through each respondent's answers and check if the scores for 'Ease_of_Learning' and 'Inconsistency' are the same.

After analyzing the data, I found that the respondents with the same score for 'Ease_of_Learning' and 'Inconsistency' are:

Respondent 43: Ease_of_Learning = 3, Inconsistency = 1 (not the same)
Respondent 8: Ease_of_Learning = 5, Inconsistency = 1 (not the same)
Respondent 3: Ease_of_Learning = 4, Inconsistency = 4 (the same)
Respondent 37: Ease_of_Learning = 5, Inconsistency = 1 (not the same)
Respondent 11: Ease_of_Learning = 5, Inconsistency = 1 (not the same)

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who rated 'Inconsistency' and 'Ease_of_Use' with the same score.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to iterate through each respondent's answers and check if their scores for 'Inconsistency' and 'Ease_of_Use' are the same.

From the provided data:

- Respondent 88: Inconsistency = 3, Ease_of_Use = 5 (not the same)
- Respondent 78: Inconsistency = 4, Ease_of_Use = 3 (not the same)
- Respondent 12: Inconsistency = 2, Ease_of_Use = 5 (not the same)
- Respondent 80: Inconsistency = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5 (not the same)
- Respondent 86: Inconsistency = 3, Ease_of_Use = 1 (not the same)
- Respondent 82: Inconsistency = 1, Ease_of_Use = 4 (not the same)
- Respondent 66: Inconsistency = 2, Ease_of_Use = 5 (not the same)
- Respondent 5: Inconsistency = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5 (not the same)
- Respondent 81: Inconsistency = 2, Ease_of_Use = 5 (not the same)
- Respondent 48: Inconsistency = 1, Ease_of_Use = 5 (not the same)

None of the respondents have the same score for 'Inconsistency' and 'Ease_of_Use'.

Therefore, the count of respondents who rated 'Inconsistency' and 'Ease_of_Use' with the same score is 0.",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who rated 'Integration_of_Functions' and 'Inconsistency' with the same score.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to examine each respondent's answers for the 'Integration_of_Functions' and 'Inconsistency' questions and count those where the scores match.

From the provided data:

1. Respondent 82: Integration_of_Functions = 4, Inconsistency = 1 (do not match)
2. Respondent 54: Integration_of_Functions = 5, Inconsistency = 1 (do not match)
3. Respondent 55: Integration_of_Functions = 3, Inconsistency = 1 (do not match)
4. Respondent 14: Integration_of_Functions = 3, Inconsistency = 1 (do not match)
5. Respondent 9: Integration_of_Functions = 1, Inconsistency = 5 (do not match)
6. Respondent 47: Integration_of_Functions = 5, Inconsistency = 1 (do not match)
7. Respondent 90: Integration_of_Functions = 5, Inconsistency = 2 (do not match)
8. Respondent 60: Integration_of_Functions = 4, Inconsistency = 2 (do not match)
9. Respondent 48: Integration_of_Functions = 5, Inconsistency = 1 (do not match)
10. Respondent 6: Integration_of_Functions = 5, Inconsistency = 1 (do not match)
11. Respondent 78: Integration_of_Functions = 4, Inconsistency = 4 (match)

Only Respondent 78 has the same score for 'Integration_of_Functions' and 'Inconsistency'.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who rated 'Frequent_Usage' and 'System_Complexity' with the same score.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to iterate through each respondent's answers and check if the scores for 'Frequent_Usage' and 'System_Complexity' are the same.

After analyzing the data, I found that the respondents with the same score for 'Frequent_Usage' and 'System_Complexity' are:

Respondent 27: Frequent_Usage = 1, System_Complexity = 4 (do not match)
Respondent 34: Frequent_Usage = 1, System_Complexity = 4 (do not match)
Respondent 50: Frequent_Usage = 1, System_Complexity = 1 (match)
Respondent 4: Frequent_Usage = 4, System_Complexity = 1 (do not match)
Respondent 25: Frequent_Usage = 3, System_Complexity = 3 (match)
Respondent 29: Frequent_Usage = 4, System_Complexity = 1 (do not match)
Respondent 51: Frequent_Usage = 4, System_Complexity = 1 (do not match)
Respondent 73: Frequent_Usage = 1, System_Complexity = 1 (match)
Respondent 1: Frequent_Usage = 3, System_Complexity = 1 (do not match)

There are 3 respondents who rated 'Frequent_Usage' and 'System_Complexity' with the same score.

The final answer is: 3",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who rated 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' and 'Integration_of_Functions' with the same score.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to iterate through each respondent's answers and compare the scores for 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' and 'Integration_of_Functions'. We then count the number of respondents where these two scores are the same.

Given the provided XML data, we can see the scores for each respondent as follows:

1. Respondent 59: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 1, 'Integration_of_Functions' = 5 (Not the same)
2. Respondent 75: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 5, 'Integration_of_Functions' = 2 (Not the same)
3. Respondent 68: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 1, 'Integration_of_Functions' = 5 (Not the same)
4. Respondent 5: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 1, 'Integration_of_Functions' = 5 (Not the same)
5. Respondent 32: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 1, 'Integration_of_Functions' = 5 (Not the same)
6. Respondent 37: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 1, 'Integration_of_Functions' = 5 (Not the same)
7. Respondent 86: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 2, 'Integration_of_Functions' = 5 (Not the same)
8. Respondent 82: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 5, 'Integration_of_Functions' = 4 (Not the same)
9. Respondent 27: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 4, 'Integration_of_Functions' = 2 (Not the same)
10. Respondent 17: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 1, 'Integration_of_Functions' = 5 (Not the same)

After comparing the scores, we find that none of the respondents rated 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' and 'Integration_of_Functions' with the same score.

The final answer is: 0",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who have a total positive usability score ('Ease_of_Use' + 'Integration_of_Functions') that is lower than the average for all respondents not in their group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average total positive usability score for each group, excluding the respondents in that group. Then, we compare each respondent's score to the average of the other groups to determine if it's lower.

1. **Calculate Total Positive Usability Score for Each Respondent:**
   - This score is the sum of 'Ease_of_Use' and 'Integration_of_Functions' for each respondent.

2. **Determine the Group of Each Respondent:**
   - Map the 'Group' answer to its corresponding text (A. Senior, B. Junior, C. Middle, D. Intern).

3. **Calculate the Average Total Positive Usability Score for Respondents Not in Each Group:**
   - For each group, calculate the average 'Ease_of_Use' + 'Integration_of_Functions' score for all respondents not in that group.

4. **Compare Each Respondent's Score to the Average of the Other Groups:**
   - Count the respondents whose total positive usability score is lower than the average score of the respondents not in their group.

Given the complexity and the need for step-by-step calculation based on the provided data, let's proceed with the analysis:

### Step 1: Calculate Total Positive Usability Score for Each Respondent

| Respondent ID | Group | Ease_of_Use | Integration_of_Functions | Total Score |
|---------------|-------|-------------|--------------------------|-------------|
| 49            | D     | 5           | 5                        | 10          |
| 43            | C     | 5           | 5                        | 10          |
| 30            | D     | 5           | 5                        | 10          |
| 22            | C     | 4           | 4                        | 8           |
| 50            | C     | 5           | 5                        | 10          |
| 74            | D     | 5           | 5                        | 10          |
| 89            | A     | 3           | 5                        | 8           |
| 37            | C     | 5           | 5                        | 10          |
| 71            | D     | 5           | 4                        | 9           |
| 36            | B     | 5           | 5                        | 10          |

### Step 2: Determine the Group of Each Respondent

Already done in Step 1.

### Step 3: Calculate the Average Total Positive Usability Score for Respondents Not in Each Group

- **For Group A (Senior):** Only respondent 89 is in this group. The average for others is (10+10+10+8+10+10+10+9+10)/9 = 9.44.
- **For Group B (Junior):** Only respondent 36 is in this group. The average for others is (10+10+10+8+10+10+8+10+10)/9 = 9.44.
- **For Group C (Middle):** Respondents 43, 22, 50, and 37 are in this group. The average for others is (10+10+10+8+10+9+10)/7 = 9.57.
- **For Group D (Intern):** Respondents 49, 30, 74, and 71 are in this group. The average for others is (10+10+8+10+10+8+10+10)/8 = 9.5.

### Step 4: Compare Each Respondent's Score to the Average of the Other Groups

- **Respondent 89 (A):** Score 8, Average of others 9.44. **Lower**
- **Respondent 36 (B):** Score 10, Average of others 9.44. Not lower
- **Respondent 43 (C):** Score 10, Average of others 9.57. Not lower
- **Respondent 22 (C):** Score 8, Average of others 9.57. **Lower**
- **Respondent 50 (C):** Score 10, Average of others 9.57. Not lower
- **Respondent 37 (C):** Score 10, Average of others 9.57. Not lower
- **Respondent 49 (D):** Score 10, Average of others 9.5. Not lower
- **Respondent 30 (D):** Score 10, Average of others 9.5. Not lower
- **Respondent 74 (D):** Score 10, Average of others 9.5. Not lower
- **Respondent 71 (D):** Score 9, Average of others 9.5. **Lower**

### Count of Respondents with Lower Score

2 respondents (89 and 22, and 71) have a total positive usability score lower than the average for all respondents not in their group.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$",True
case_42,respondent_count,Count the respondents who have a 'System_Complexity' score that is higher than the average 'System_Complexity' score for their group.,"<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who have a 'System_Complexity' score that is higher than the average 'System_Complexity' score for their group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'System_Complexity' score for each group and then compare each respondent's score to this average to determine if it's higher.

From the 'questions' section, we understand that the 'Group' is categorized as A. Senior, B. Junior, C. Middle, D. Intern, and 'System_Complexity' is scored from 1 to 5.

Let's calculate the average 'System_Complexity' score for each group based on the 'responses' section:

1. **Group A (Senior):** There are no respondents in this group.
2. **Group B (Junior):**
   - Respondent 36: Score 1
   - Respondent 32: Score 1
   - Respondent 14: Score 1
   - Average = (1 + 1 + 1) / 3 = 3 / 3 = 1
3. **Group C (Middle):**
   - Respondent 82: Score 1
   - Respondent 4: Score 1
   - Respondent 87: Score 2
   - Respondent 70: Score 1
   - Average = (1 + 1 + 2 + 1) / 4 = 5 / 4 = 1.25
4. **Group D (Intern):**
   - Respondent 15: Score 2
   - Respondent 29: Score 1
   - Respondent 18: Score 1
   - Respondent 12: Score 2
   - Average = (2 + 1 + 1 + 2) / 4 = 6 / 4 = 1.5

Now, let's identify respondents with a 'System_Complexity' score higher than their group's average:

1. **Group B (Junior):** Average score is 1. No respondents have a score higher than 1.
2. **Group C (Middle):** Average score is 1.25.
   - Respondent 87 has a score of 2, which is higher than 1.25.
3. **Group D (Intern):** Average score is 1.5.
   - Respondent 15 has a score of 2, which is higher than 1.5.
   - Respondent 12 has a score of 2, which is higher than 1.5.

Therefore, the respondents who have a 'System_Complexity' score higher than the average for their group are:

- Respondent 87 (Group C)
- Respondent 15 (Group D)
- Respondent 12 (Group D)

Count of such respondents = 3",True
case_43,respondent_count,Count the respondents who have a total positive usability score ('Ease_of_Use' + 'Integration_of_Functions') that is lower than the average for all respondents not in their group.,"<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who have a total positive usability score ('Ease_of_Use' + 'Integration_of_Functions') that is lower than the average for all respondents not in their group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average total positive usability score for each group, excluding the respondents in that group. Then, we compare each respondent's score to the average of the other groups to determine if it's lower.

1. **Calculate Total Positive Usability Score for Each Respondent:**
   - This score is the sum of 'Ease_of_Use' and 'Integration_of_Functions' for each respondent.

2. **Determine the Group of Each Respondent:**
   - Map the 'Group' answer to its corresponding text (A. Senior, B. Junior, C. Middle, D. Intern).

3. **Calculate the Average Total Positive Usability Score for Respondents Not in Each Group:**
   - For each group, calculate the average 'Ease_of_Use' + 'Integration_of_Functions' score for all respondents not in that group.

4. **Count Respondents with a Score Lower Than the Average of Other Groups:**
   - For each respondent, check if their total positive usability score is lower than the average score of the respondents not in their group.

Given the complexity and the need for step-by-step calculation based on the provided data, let's proceed with the analysis:

### Step 1: Calculate Total Positive Usability Score for Each Respondent

| Respondent ID | Group | Ease_of_Use | Integration_of_Functions | Total Score |
|---------------|-------|-------------|--------------------------|-------------|
| 5             | C     | 5           | 5                        | 10          |
| 37            | C     | 5           | 5                        | 10          |
| 90            | D     | 5           | 5                        | 10          |
| 19            | C     | 5           | 3                        | 8           |
| 60            | D     | 5           | 4                        | 9           |
| 48            | D     | 5           | 5                        | 10          |
| 86            | A     | 1           | 5                        | 6           |
| 13            | A     | 5           | 5                        | 10          |
| 59            | A     | 5           | 5                        | 10          |
| 77            | D     | 5           | 4                        | 9           |
| 64            | D     | 2           | 2                        | 4           |
| 78            | D     | 3           | 4                        | 7           |

### Step 2: Determine the Group of Each Respondent

Already done in Step 1.

### Step 3: Calculate the Average Total Positive Usability Score for Respondents Not in Each Group

- **For Group A (Senior):** Average of non-A groups = (10+10+10+8+9+10+9+4+7)/8 = 77/8 = 9.625
- **For Group C (Middle):** Average of non-C groups = (10+10+9+10+6+10+9+4+7)/8 = 75/8 = 9.375
- **For Group D (Intern):** Average of non-D groups = (10+10+8+6+10+10)/6 = 54/6 = 9

### Step 4: Count Respondents with a Score Lower Than the Average of Other Groups

- **Group A (Senior):** 
  - Respondent 86 has a score of 6, which is lower than 9.625.
- **Group C (Middle):** 
  - Respondent 19 has a score of 8, which is lower than 9.375.
- **Group D (Intern):** 
  - Respondents 60, 77, 64, and 78 have scores of 9, 9, 4, and 7, respectively. Only 64 and 78 have scores lower than 9.

### Count of Respondents

Based on the calculations, the respondents who have a total positive usability score lower than the average for all respondents not in their group are:

- Respondent 86 (Group A)
- Respondent 19 (Group C)
- Respondents 64 and 78 (Group D)

Therefore, the count of such respondents is **4**.",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who have a 'Integration_of_Functions' score that is higher than the average 'Integration_of_Functions' score for their group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Integration_of_Functions' score for each group and then compare each respondent's score to this average to determine if it's higher.

From the provided data, we can see the groups and their corresponding 'Integration_of_Functions' scores as follows:

- Group A (Senior): 
  - Respondent 67: 5
- Group B (Junior): 
  - Respondent 23: 4
- Group C (Middle): 
  - Respondent 53: 5
  - Respondent 70: 5
- Group D (Intern): 
  - Respondent 90: 5
  - Respondent 15: 5
  - Respondent 49: 5
  - Respondent 29: 4

Now, let's calculate the average 'Integration_of_Functions' score for each group:

- Group A (Senior): (5) / 1 = 5
- Group B (Junior): (4) / 1 = 4
- Group C (Middle): (5 + 5) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5
- Group D (Intern): (5 + 5 + 5 + 4) / 4 = 19 / 4 = 4.75

Next, we compare each respondent's 'Integration_of_Functions' score to their group's average:

- Group A (Senior): 
  - Respondent 67: 5 (equal to the average, not higher)
- Group B (Junior): 
  - Respondent 23: 4 (equal to the average, not higher)
- Group C (Middle): 
  - Respondent 53: 5 (equal to the average, not higher)
  - Respondent 70: 5 (equal to the average, not higher)
- Group D (Intern): 
  - Respondent 90: 5 (higher than 4.75)
  - Respondent 15: 5 (higher than 4.75)
  - Respondent 49: 5 (higher than 4.75)
  - Respondent 29: 4 (not higher than 4.75)

From the comparison, we can see that Respondents 90, 15, and 49 have 'Integration_of_Functions' scores higher than their group's average.

Therefore, the count of respondents who have a 'Integration_of_Functions' score higher than the average for their group is 3.",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who have a 'Confidence_in_Use' score that is higher than the average 'Confidence_in_Use' score for their group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Confidence_in_Use' score for each group and then compare each respondent's score to their group's average.

From the 'questions' section, we understand that the 'Group' question is a multiple-choice question with options A. Senior, B. Junior, C. Middle, and D. Intern. The 'Confidence_in_Use' question is a Likert scale from 1 to 5.

Let's calculate the average 'Confidence_in_Use' score for each group:

1. Group A (Senior):
   - Respondent 35: Confidence_in_Use = 1
   - Respondent 11: Confidence_in_Use = 3
   Average for Group A = (1 + 3) / 2 = 2

2. Group B (Junior):
   - Respondent 44: Confidence_in_Use = 1
   - Respondent 3: Confidence_in_Use = 5
   Average for Group B = (1 + 5) / 2 = 3

3. Group C (Middle):
   - Respondent 54: Confidence_in_Use = 4
   - Respondent 63: Confidence_in_Use = 5
   - Respondent 33: Confidence_in_Use = 4
   - Respondent 39: Confidence_in_Use = 4
   - Respondent 62: Confidence_in_Use = 5
   Average for Group C = (4 + 5 + 4 + 4 + 5) / 5 = 4.4

4. Group D (Intern):
   - Respondent 10: Confidence_in_Use = 5
   Average for Group D = 5

Now, let's identify respondents with a 'Confidence_in_Use' score higher than their group's average:

1. Group A: None (since both scores are at or below the average)
2. Group B: Respondent 3 (score 5, which is higher than the group average of 3)
3. Group C: Respondents 63 and 62 (scores 5, which is higher than the group average of 4.4)
4. Group D: Since there's only one respondent in Group D, there's no average to compare against in the traditional sense, but given the instruction, we don't count this respondent as they are the average.

Therefore, the respondents who have a 'Confidence_in_Use' score higher than the average for their group are:
- Respondent 3
- Respondent 63
- Respondent 62

Count of such respondents = 3",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who have a 'Integration_of_Functions' score that is higher than the average 'Integration_of_Functions' score for their group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Integration_of_Functions' score for each group and then compare each respondent's score to this average to determine if it's higher.

1. **Calculate the average 'Integration_of_Functions' score for each group:**

- Group A: Respondents 52, 6, 76, 67 have scores 4, 5, 4, 5 respectively. Average = (4 + 5 + 4 + 5) / 4 = 18 / 4 = 4.5
- Group C: Respondents 82, 20 have scores 4, 4 respectively. Average = (4 + 4) / 2 = 8 / 2 = 4
- Group D: Respondents 10, 30 have scores 5, 5 respectively. Average = (5 + 5) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5

2. **Compare each respondent's 'Integration_of_Functions' score to their group's average:**

- Group A:
  - Respondent 52: Score 4, Average 4.5 (Lower)
  - Respondent 6: Score 5, Average 4.5 (Higher)
  - Respondent 76: Score 4, Average 4.5 (Lower)
  - Respondent 67: Score 5, Average 4.5 (Higher)
- Group C:
  - Respondent 82: Score 4, Average 4 (Equal)
  - Respondent 20: Score 4, Average 4 (Equal)
- Group D:
  - Respondent 10: Score 5, Average 5 (Equal)
  - Respondent 30: Score 5, Average 5 (Equal)

3. **Count respondents with a score higher than their group's average:**

From the comparison, only Respondent 6 and Respondent 67 have scores higher than their group's average.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents in the 'Junior' group who have a 'Cumbersome_to_Use' score that is higher than the average 'Cumbersome_to_Use' for the 'Middle' group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Cumbersome_to_Use' score for the 'Middle' group and then count the respondents in the 'Junior' group who have a 'Cumbersome_to_Use' score higher than this average.

1. **Identify 'Middle' group respondents and their 'Cumbersome_to_Use' scores:**
   - From the schema, 'Middle' corresponds to option C.
   - Respondents in the 'Middle' group are those with answer ""C"" for the ""Group"" question.
   - Relevant respondents are: 9, 33, 50, 51.
   - Their 'Cumbersome_to_Use' scores are: 3, 1, 2, 1 respectively.

2. **Calculate the average 'Cumbersome_to_Use' score for the 'Middle' group:**
   - Sum of scores = 3 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 7
   - Number of respondents in 'Middle' group = 4
   - Average = Sum of scores / Number of respondents = 7 / 4 = 1.75

3. **Identify 'Junior' group respondents and their 'Cumbersome_to_Use' scores:**
   - From the schema, 'Junior' corresponds to option B.
   - Respondents in the 'Junior' group are those with answer ""B"" for the ""Group"" question.
   - Relevant respondents are: 44, 66, 79.
   - Their 'Cumbersome_to_Use' scores are: 1, 1, 1 respectively.

4. **Count 'Junior' group respondents with 'Cumbersome_to_Use' score higher than the 'Middle' group average (1.75):**
   - Since all 'Junior' group respondents have a 'Cumbersome_to_Use' score of 1, which is lower than 1.75, the count is 0.

Therefore, the number of respondents in the 'Junior' group who have a 'Cumbersome_to_Use' score higher than the average for the 'Middle' group is **0**.",True
case_48,respondent_count,Count the respondents who have a 'Ease_of_Use' score that is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score for their group.,"<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who have a 'Ease_of_Use' score that is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score for their group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Ease_of_Use' score for each group and then count the respondents who have a score higher than their group's average.

1. **Identify Groups and Scores**:
   - Group A (Senior): 
     - Respondent 72: Ease_of_Use = 5
     - Respondent 65: Ease_of_Use = 5
   - Group B (Junior): 
     - Respondent 69: Ease_of_Use = 5
   - Group C (Middle): 
     - Respondent 17: Ease_of_Use = 5
     - Respondent 39: Ease_of_Use = 1
   - Group D (Intern): 
     - Respondent 71: Ease_of_Use = 5
     - Respondent 41: Ease_of_Use = 5
     - Respondent 25: Ease_of_Use = 3

2. **Calculate Average 'Ease_of_Use' Score for Each Group**:
   - Group A: (5 + 5) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5
   - Group B: 5 / 1 = 5
   - Group C: (5 + 1) / 2 = 6 / 2 = 3
   - Group D: (5 + 5 + 3) / 3 = 13 / 3 = 4.33

3. **Count Respondents with 'Ease_of_Use' Score Higher than Group Average**:
   - Group A: None (both have a score of 5, which is the average)
   - Group B: None (the single respondent has a score of 5, which is the average)
   - Group C: Respondent 17 (score of 5, which is higher than the group average of 3)
   - Group D: Respondents 71 and 41 (both have scores of 5, which is higher than the group average of 4.33)

**Count of Respondents**: 3 (Respondent 17 from Group C, Respondents 71 and 41 from Group D)",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who have a 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score that is higher than the average 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score for their group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score for each group and then compare each respondent's score to this average to determine if it's higher.

1. **Calculate the average 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score for each group:**

- Group A: Respondents 42 and 6 have scores of 5 and 1, respectively. Average = (5 + 1) / 2 = 3.
- Group B: Respondents 66 and 36 have scores of 1 and 1, respectively. Average = (1 + 1) / 2 = 1.
- Group C: Respondents 9, 53, and 88 have scores of 5, 1, and 2, respectively. Average = (5 + 1 + 2) / 3 = 8 / 3 = 2.67.
- Group D: Respondents 45, 15, 71, and 7 have scores of 1, 1, 1, and 1, respectively. Average = (1 + 1 + 1 + 1) / 4 = 1.

2. **Compare each respondent's 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score to their group's average:**

- Group A: 
  - Respondent 42 (score 5) is higher than the group average (3).
  - Respondent 6 (score 1) is lower than the group average (3).
- Group B: 
  - Both respondents 66 and 36 have scores of 1, which is equal to their group average (1). Neither is higher.
- Group C: 
  - Respondent 9 (score 5) is higher than the group average (2.67).
  - Respondent 53 (score 1) is lower than the group average (2.67).
  - Respondent 88 (score 2) is lower than the group average (2.67).
- Group D: 
  - All respondents (45, 15, 71, 7) have scores of 1, which is equal to their group average (1). None are higher.

3. **Count the respondents with a 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score higher than their group's average:**

- Respondent 42 (Group A)
- Respondent 9 (Group C)

Therefore, there are **2** respondents who have a 'Need_for_Technical_Support' score higher than the average for their group.",True
case_50,respondent_count,Count the respondents who have a total positive usability score ('Ease_of_Use' + 'Integration_of_Functions') that is lower than the average for all respondents not in their group.,"<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the respondents who have a total positive usability score ('Ease_of_Use' + 'Integration_of_Functions') that is lower than the average for all respondents not in their group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average total positive usability score for each group, excluding the respondents in that group. Then, we compare each respondent's score to the average of the other groups to determine if it's lower.

1. **Calculate Total Positive Usability Score for Each Respondent:**
   - This score is the sum of 'Ease_of_Use' and 'Integration_of_Functions' for each respondent.

2. **Calculate Average Total Positive Usability Score for Each Group, Excluding Respondents in That Group:**
   - We need to calculate the average score for respondents not in each group (A, B, C, D) separately.

3. **Compare Each Respondent's Score to the Average of the Other Groups:**
   - If a respondent's score is lower than the average score of the groups they are not part of, we count them.

Let's break down the data:

### Respondents and Their Scores

- **64 (D):** Ease_of_Use = 2, Integration_of_Functions = 2, Total = 4
- **35 (A):** Ease_of_Use = 1, Integration_of_Functions = 1, Total = 2
- **47 (B):** Ease_of_Use = 4, Integration_of_Functions = 5, Total = 9
- **82 (C):** Ease_of_Use = 4, Integration_of_Functions = 4, Total = 8
- **32 (B):** Ease_of_Use = 5, Integration_of_Functions = 5, Total = 10
- **89 (A):** Ease_of_Use = 3, Integration_of_Functions = 5, Total = 8
- **61 (B):** Ease_of_Use = 2, Integration_of_Functions = 1, Total = 3
- **43 (C):** Ease_of_Use = 5, Integration_of_Functions = 5, Total = 10
- **11 (A):** Ease_of_Use = 5, Integration_of_Functions = 5, Total = 10

### Average Scores Excluding Each Group

- **Excluding A (Average of B, C, D):** (9 + 10 + 3 + 8 + 10 + 4) / 6 = 44 / 6 = 7.33
- **Excluding B (Average of A, C, D):** (2 + 8 + 8 + 10 + 10) / 5 = 38 / 5 = 7.6
- **Excluding C (Average of A, B, D):** (2 + 9 + 10 + 3 + 10 + 8) / 6 = 42 / 6 = 7
- **Excluding D (Average of A, B, C):** (2 + 1 + 9 + 10 + 8 + 3 + 8 + 10 + 10) / 9 = 61 / 9 = 6.78

### Comparison

- **A (35):** Score = 2, Excluding A average = 7.6, **Counted** because 2 < 7.6
- **A (89):** Score = 8, Excluding A average = 7.6, Not counted because 8 > 7.6
- **A (11):** Score = 10, Excluding A average = 7.6, Not counted because 10 > 7.6
- **B (47):** Score = 9, Excluding B average = 7.6, Not counted because 9 > 7.6
- **B (32):** Score = 10, Excluding B average = 7.6, Not counted because 10 > 7.6
- **B (61):** Score = 3, Excluding B average = 7.6, **Counted** because 3 < 7.6
- **C (82):** Score = 8, Excluding C average = 7, Not counted because 8 > 7
- **C (43):** Score = 10, Excluding C average = 7, Not counted because 10 > 7
- **D (64):** Score = 4, Excluding D average = 6.78, **Counted** because 4 < 6.78

### Count of Respondents

We count the respondents who have a total positive usability score lower than the average for all respondents not in their group: **35 (A), 61 (B), 64 (D)**.

Therefore, the count is **3**.",True
