<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'Inconsistency' score is higher than the average 'Inconsistency' score for their group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Inconsistency' score for each group and then identify the respondents whose 'Inconsistency' score is higher than their group's average.

### Step 1: Calculate the average 'Inconsistency' score for each group.

- **Group A (Senior):** Respondent 89 has an 'Inconsistency' score of 3. Since there's only one respondent from Group A, the average is 3.
- **Group B (Junior):** Respondent 36 has an 'Inconsistency' score of 1. With only one respondent, the average is 1.
- **Group C (Middle):** Respondents 43, 50, 22, and 37 have 'Inconsistency' scores of 1, 2, 5, and 1, respectively. The sum is 1 + 2 + 5 + 1 = 9, and with 4 respondents, the average is 9 / 4 = 2.25.
- **Group D (Intern):** Respondents 49, 30, 74, and 71 have 'Inconsistency' scores of 4, 1, 3, and 2, respectively. The sum is 4 + 1 + 3 + 2 = 10, and with 4 respondents, the average is 10 / 4 = 2.5.

### Step 2: Identify respondents whose 'Inconsistency' score is higher than their group's average.

- **Group A (Senior):** Since the average is 3, and Respondent 89 has a score of 3, there are no respondents above the average.
- **Group B (Junior):** The average is 1, and Respondent 36 has a score of 1, so there are no respondents above the average.
- **Group C (Middle):** The average is 2.25. Respondents with scores higher than 2.25 are Respondent 22 (score of 5) and Respondent 50 (score of 2, which is not higher than 2.25, so only Respondent 22 qualifies).
- **Group D (Intern):** The average is 2.5. Respondents with scores higher than 2.5 are Respondent 49 (score of 4) and Respondent 74 (score of 3, which is higher than 2.5).

### Respondents whose 'Inconsistency' score is higher than the average for their group:

- Respondent 22 (Group C)
- Respondent 49 (Group D)
- Respondent 74 (Group D)

Therefore, the list of respondents is: 22, 49, 74.",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'Ease_of_Use' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score for their group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Ease_of_Use' score for each group and then identify the respondents whose 'Ease_of_Use' score is higher than their group's average.

### Step 1: Calculate the average 'Ease_of_Use' score for each group.

We will go through each respondent's data, sum up the 'Ease_of_Use' scores for each group, and count the number of respondents in each group. Then, we will calculate the average 'Ease_of_Use' score for each group.

### Respondents and their 'Ease_of_Use' scores by group:

- **Group B (Junior):**
  - Respondent 36: Ease_of_Use = 5
  - Respondent 32: Ease_of_Use = 5
  - Respondent 14: Ease_of_Use = 4
- **Group C (Middle):**
  - Respondent 82: Ease_of_Use = 4
  - Respondent 4: Ease_of_Use = 5
  - Respondent 87: Ease_of_Use = 3
  - Respondent 70: Ease_of_Use = 5
- **Group D (Intern):**
  - Respondent 15: Ease_of_Use = 4
  - Respondent 29: Ease_of_Use = 4
  - Respondent 18: Ease_of_Use = 4
  - Respondent 12: Ease_of_Use = 5

### Step 2: Calculate the sum of 'Ease_of_Use' scores and count respondents for each group.

- **Group B (Junior):** Sum = 5 + 5 + 4 = 14, Count = 3
- **Group C (Middle):** Sum = 4 + 5 + 3 + 5 = 17, Count = 4
- **Group D (Intern):** Sum = 4 + 4 + 4 + 5 = 17, Count = 4

### Step 3: Calculate the average 'Ease_of_Use' score for each group.

- **Group B (Junior):** Average = 14 / 3 = 4.67
- **Group C (Middle):** Average = 17 / 4 = 4.25
- **Group D (Intern):** Average = 17 / 4 = 4.25

### Step 4: Identify respondents whose 'Ease_of_Use' score is higher than their group's average.

- **Group B (Junior):** All respondents (36, 32, 14) have scores of 4 or 5, which means respondents 36 and 32 are above the average.
- **Group C (Middle):** Respondents with scores higher than 4.25 are 4 and 70.
- **Group D (Intern):** The respondent with a score higher than 4.25 is 12.

### Step 5: List the identified respondents.

Respondents whose 'Ease_of_Use' score is higher than the average for their group are: 36, 32, 4, 70, 12.

The final answer is: $\boxed{36, 32, 4, 70, 12}$",False

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondents have a total negative usability score ('System_Complexity' + 'Inconsistency' + 'Cumbersome_to_Use') that is higher than the average for their group?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the total negative usability score for each respondent, which is the sum of 'System_Complexity', 'Inconsistency', and 'Cumbersome_to_Use'. Then, we calculate the average of this score for each group. Finally, we identify the respondents whose total negative usability score is higher than the average for their group.

### Step 1: Calculate Total Negative Usability Score for Each Respondent

We calculate the total negative usability score for each respondent by summing 'System_Complexity', 'Inconsistency', and 'Cumbersome_to_Use'.

### Step 2: Calculate Average Total Negative Usability Score for Each Group

We group the respondents by their 'Group' and calculate the average total negative usability score for each group.

### Step 3: Identify Respondents with Higher Than Average Score

We compare each respondent's total negative usability score with the average score of their group and identify those with a higher score.

Given the complexity and the need for precise calculations based on the provided data, let's proceed with the analysis:

1. **Respondent 5**: Group C, Score = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
2. **Respondent 37**: Group C, Score = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
3. **Respondent 90**: Group D, Score = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5
4. **Respondent 19**: Group C, Score = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4
5. **Respondent 60**: Group D, Score = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4
6. **Respondent 48**: Group D, Score = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
7. **Respondent 86**: Group A, Score = 5 + 3 + 5 = 13
8. **Respondent 13**: Group A, Score = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
9. **Respondent 59**: Group A, Score = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
10. **Respondent 77**: Group D, Score = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
11. **Respondent 64**: Group D, Score = 3 + 4 + 4 = 11
12. **Respondent 78**: Group D, Score = 1 + 4 + 2 = 7

### Group Averages:
- **Group A**: (13 + 3 + 3) / 3 = 19 / 3 = 6.33
- **Group C**: (3 + 3 + 4) / 3 = 10 / 3 = 3.33
- **Group D**: (5 + 4 + 3 + 3 + 11 + 7) / 6 = 33 / 6 = 5.5

### Identify Respondents with Higher Than Average Score:
- **Group A**: Respondent 86 (Score = 13) is higher than the average (6.33).
- **Group C**: Respondent 19 (Score = 4) is higher than the average (3.33).
- **Group D**: Respondents 90 (Score = 5), 60 (Score = 4), 64 (Score = 11), and 78 (Score = 7) are higher than the average (5.5).

Thus, the respondents with a total negative usability score higher than the average for their group are:
- Respondent 86
- Respondent 19
- Respondent 64
- Respondent 78 

Note: Respondent 90 and 60's scores are not higher than their group's average upon reevaluation.",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents in the 'Intern' group whose 'Confidence_in_Use' is higher than the average 'Confidence_in_Use' for the 'Junior' group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Confidence_in_Use' for the 'Junior' group. Then, we will identify all respondents in the 'Intern' group and check if their 'Confidence_in_Use' is higher than this average.

1. **Calculate the average 'Confidence_in_Use' for the 'Junior' group:**

Respondents in the 'Junior' group are those with **Group:** B.

- Respondent 44: **Confidence_in_Use:** 1
- Respondent 3: **Confidence_in_Use:** 5

Average 'Confidence_in_Use' for 'Junior' = (1 + 5) / 2 = 3

2. **Identify respondents in the 'Intern' group with 'Confidence_in_Use' higher than the average for 'Junior':**

The 'Intern' group corresponds to **Group:** D.

- Respondent 10: **Confidence_in_Use:** 5

Since 5 is higher than 3, Respondent 10 meets the criteria.

Therefore, the respondent in the 'Intern' group whose 'Confidence_in_Use' is higher than the average 'Confidence_in_Use' for the 'Junior' group is:

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents have a total negative usability score ('System_Complexity' + 'Inconsistency' + 'Cumbersome_to_Use') that is higher than the average for their group?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the total negative usability score for each respondent, which is the sum of 'System_Complexity', 'Inconsistency', and 'Cumbersome_to_Use'. Then, we calculate the average of this score for each group. Finally, we identify the respondents whose total negative usability score is higher than the average for their respective group.

### Step 1: Calculate Total Negative Usability Score for Each Respondent

- Respondent 10: 1 (System_Complexity) + 1 (Inconsistency) + 1 (Cumbersome_to_Use) = 3
- Respondent 52: 1 + 2 + 1 = 4
- Respondent 6: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
- Respondent 76: 1 + 2 + 2 = 5
- Respondent 30: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
- Respondent 82: 1 + 1 + 2 = 4
- Respondent 67: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
- Respondent 20: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3

### Step 2: Identify Group for Each Respondent and Calculate Average Total Negative Usability Score for Each Group

- Group A: Respondents 52, 6, 76, 67
  - Scores: 4, 3, 5, 3
  - Average = (4 + 3 + 5 + 3) / 4 = 15 / 4 = 3.75
- Group C: Respondents 82, 20
  - Scores: 4, 3
  - Average = (4 + 3) / 2 = 7 / 2 = 3.5
- Group D: Respondents 10, 30
  - Scores: 3, 3
  - Average = (3 + 3) / 2 = 6 / 2 = 3

### Step 3: Identify Respondents with Total Negative Usability Score Higher Than Group Average

- Group A: 
  - Respondent 52 (Score: 4) is higher than the group average (3.75), No.
  - Respondent 6 (Score: 3) is not higher than the group average.
  - Respondent 76 (Score: 5) is higher than the group average.
  - Respondent 67 (Score: 3) is not higher than the group average.
- Group C:
  - Respondent 82 (Score: 4) is higher than the group average (3.5).
  - Respondent 20 (Score: 3) is not higher than the group average.
- Group D:
  - Respondent 10 (Score: 3) is equal to the group average.
  - Respondent 30 (Score: 3) is equal to the group average.

### Respondents with Score Higher Than Group Average

- Respondent 76
- Respondent 82

The final answer is: $\boxed{76, 82}$",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondents have a total negative usability score ('System_Complexity' + 'Inconsistency' + 'Cumbersome_to_Use') that is higher than the average for their group?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the total negative usability score for each respondent, which is the sum of 'System_Complexity', 'Inconsistency', and 'Cumbersome_to_Use'. Then, we calculate the average of this score for each group. Finally, we identify the respondents whose total negative usability score is higher than the average for their respective group.

### Step 1: Calculate Total Negative Usability Score for Each Respondent

We calculate the total negative usability score for each respondent by summing 'System_Complexity', 'Inconsistency', and 'Cumbersome_to_Use'.

### Step 2: Calculate Average Total Negative Usability Score for Each Group

We group the respondents by their 'Group' and calculate the average total negative usability score for each group.

### Step 3: Identify Respondents with Higher Than Average Score

We compare each respondent's total negative usability score with the average score of their group and identify those with a higher score.

Given the complexity and the need for precise calculations based on the provided data, let's proceed with the analysis:

1. **Respondent 46**: Group A, Score = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4
2. **Respondent 9**: Group C, Score = 3 + 5 + 3 = 11
3. **Respondent 56**: Group A, Score = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4
4. **Respondent 71**: Group D, Score = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4
5. **Respondent 59**: Group A, Score = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
6. **Respondent 74**: Group D, Score = 1 + 3 + 1 = 5
7. **Respondent 44**: Group B, Score = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4
8. **Respondent 33**: Group C, Score = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
9. **Respondent 66**: Group B, Score = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4
10. **Respondent 50**: Group C, Score = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5
11. **Respondent 51**: Group C, Score = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
12. **Respondent 79**: Group B, Score = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3

### Group Averages:
- **Group A**: (4 + 4 + 3) / 3 = 11 / 3 = 3.67
- **Group B**: (4 + 4 + 3) / 3 = 11 / 3 = 3.67
- **Group C**: (11 + 3 + 5 + 3) / 4 = 22 / 4 = 5.5
- **Group D**: (4 + 5) / 2 = 9 / 2 = 4.5

### Identify Respondents with Higher Than Average Score:
- **Group A**: None (all scores are below or equal to the average)
- **Group B**: None (all scores are below or equal to the average)
- **Group C**: Respondent 9 (Score = 11, Average = 5.5), Respondent 50 (Score = 5, Average = 5.5)
- **Group D**: Respondent 74 (Score = 5, Average = 4.5)

Thus, the respondents with a total negative usability score higher than the average for their group are:
- Respondent 9
- Respondent 50
- Respondent 74

The final answer is: $\boxed{9, 50, 74}$",False

<task>
Find all respondents in the 'Junior' group whose 'Ease_of_Use' is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' for the 'Middle' group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Ease_of_Use' for the 'Middle' group and then identify respondents in the 'Junior' group with an 'Ease_of_Use' score higher than this average.

1. **Calculate the average 'Ease_of_Use' for the 'Middle' group:**

Respondents in the 'Middle' group are Respondent 17 and Respondent 39.

- Respondent 17: 'Ease_of_Use' = 5
- Respondent 39: 'Ease_of_Use' = 1

Average 'Ease_of_Use' for 'Middle' group = (5 + 1) / 2 = 3

2. **Identify respondents in the 'Junior' group:**

The 'Junior' group corresponds to option B. Respondent 69 is in the 'Junior' group.

- Respondent 69: 'Ease_of_Use' = 5

Since 5 is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' for the 'Middle' group (which is 3), Respondent 69 meets the criteria.

Therefore, the respondent in the 'Junior' group whose 'Ease_of_Use' is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' for the 'Middle' group is:

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents have a total negative usability score ('System_Complexity' + 'Inconsistency' + 'Cumbersome_to_Use') that is higher than the average for their group?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the total negative usability score for each respondent, which is the sum of 'System_Complexity', 'Inconsistency', and 'Cumbersome_to_Use'. Then, we calculate the average of this score for each group. Finally, we identify the respondents whose total negative usability score is higher than the average for their respective group.

### Step 1: Calculate Total Negative Usability Score for Each Respondent

We calculate the total negative usability score for each respondent by summing 'System_Complexity', 'Inconsistency', and 'Cumbersome_to_Use'.

### Step 2: Calculate Average Total Negative Usability Score for Each Group

We group the respondents by their 'Group' and calculate the average total negative usability score for each group.

### Step 3: Identify Respondents with Higher Than Average Score

We compare each respondent's total negative usability score with the average score of their group and identify those with a higher score.

Given the complexity and the amount of data, let's proceed with calculating:

1. **Respondent 9**: Total = 3 + 5 + 3 = 11, Group = C
2. **Respondent 45**: Total = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3, Group = D
3. **Respondent 53**: Total = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3, Group = C
4. **Respondent 15**: Total = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4, Group = D
5. **Respondent 42**: Total = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3, Group = A
6. **Respondent 71**: Total = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4, Group = D
7. **Respondent 66**: Total = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4, Group = B
8. **Respondent 7**: Total = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3, Group = D
9. **Respondent 88**: Total = 2 + 3 + 2 = 7, Group = C
10. **Respondent 6**: Total = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3, Group = A
11. **Respondent 36**: Total = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3, Group = B

### Group Averages

- **Group A**: (3 + 3) / 2 = 3
- **Group B**: (4 + 3) / 2 = 3.5
- **Group C**: (11 + 3 + 7) / 3 = 7
- **Group D**: (3 + 4 + 4 + 3) / 4 = 3.5

### Identify Respondents

- **Group A**: None
- **Group B**: None
- **Group C**: Respondent 9 (11 > 7), Respondent 88 (7 > 7) No, because 7 is not greater than 7.
- **Group D**: None

Thus, the respondents with a total negative usability score higher than the average for their group are:

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondents have a total negative usability score ('System_Complexity' + 'Inconsistency' + 'Cumbersome_to_Use') that is higher than the average for their group?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the total negative usability score for each respondent, which is the sum of 'System_Complexity', 'Inconsistency', and 'Cumbersome_to_Use'. Then, we calculate the average of this score for each group. Finally, we identify the respondents whose total negative usability score is higher than the average for their group.

### Step 1: Calculate Total Negative Usability Score for Each Respondent

1. Respondent 64: 3 (System_Complexity) + 4 (Inconsistency) + 4 (Cumbersome_to_Use) = 11
2. Respondent 35: 5 + 5 + 5 = 15
3. Respondent 47: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
4. Respondent 82: 1 + 1 + 2 = 4
5. Respondent 32: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
6. Respondent 89: 2 + 3 + 1 = 6
7. Respondent 61: 5 + 4 + 5 = 14
8. Respondent 43: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
9. Respondent 11: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3

### Step 2: Calculate Average Total Negative Usability Score for Each Group

- Group A (Senior): Respondents 35, 89, 11. Scores: 15, 6, 3. Average = (15 + 6 + 3) / 3 = 24 / 3 = 8
- Group B (Junior): Respondents 47, 32, 61. Scores: 3, 3, 14. Average = (3 + 3 + 14) / 3 = 20 / 3 = 6.67
- Group C (Middle): Respondents 82, 43. Scores: 4, 3. Average = (4 + 3) / 2 = 7 / 2 = 3.5
- Group D (Intern): Respondent 64. Score: 11. Average = 11 (since there's only one respondent)

### Step 3: Identify Respondents with Score Higher Than Group Average

- Group A: 35 (15 > 8), 89 (6 < 8), 11 (3 < 8). So, Respondent 35.
- Group B: 47 (3 < 6.67), 32 (3 < 6.67), 61 (14 > 6.67). So, Respondent 61.
- Group C: 82 (4 > 3.5), 43 (3 < 3.5). So, Respondent 82.
- Group D: Since there's only one respondent, no comparison can be made within the group, but for completeness, Respondent 64's score is the group average.

The final answer is: $\boxed{35, 61, 82}$",False
