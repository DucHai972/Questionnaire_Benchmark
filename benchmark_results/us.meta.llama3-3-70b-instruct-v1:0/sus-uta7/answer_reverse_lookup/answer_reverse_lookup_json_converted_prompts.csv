<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
List all respondents from the 'Intern' group who rated 'Integration_of_Functions' as 4.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the 'Intern' group in the 'questions' schema. According to the schema, ""Group"" is defined as ""[MCQ: A. Senior B. Junior C. Middle D. Intern]"". This means 'Intern' corresponds to option ""D"".

2. Filter the 'responses' to only include those where the ""Group"" answer is ""D"" (for 'Intern').

3. From the filtered responses, identify those where the ""Integration_of_Functions"" rating is ""4"".

Let's apply these steps to the data:

- Respondent ""31"" is in group ""D"" and rated ""Integration_of_Functions"" as ""4"".
- Respondent ""78"" is in group ""D"" but rated ""Integration_of_Functions"" as ""4"", so they qualify.
- Respondent ""48"" is in group ""D"" but rated ""Integration_of_Functions"" as ""5"", so they do not qualify.
- Respondent ""76"" and ""81"" are not in group ""D"", so they do not qualify.
- Respondent ""70"" and ""17"" are not in group ""D"", so they do not qualify.
- Respondent ""61"" is not in group ""D"", so they do not qualify.

The respondents from the 'Intern' group who rated 'Integration_of_Functions' as 4 are ""31"" and ""78"". 

The final answer is: 31, 78",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents from the 'Middle' group who rated 'System_Complexity' as 2.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to follow the instructions provided and analyze the given data.

First, we look at the 'questions' section to understand the schema. The 'Group' field is a multiple-choice question with options A. Senior, B. Junior, C. Middle, and D. Intern. The 'System_Complexity' field is a Likert scale from 1 to 5.

Next, we examine the 'responses' section to find respondents from the 'Middle' group who rated 'System_Complexity' as 2. The 'Middle' group corresponds to option C.

Looking through the responses:

1. Respondent ""22"" is from group ""C"" (Middle) and rated 'System_Complexity' as 2.
2. Respondent ""89"" is from group ""A"" (Senior), so they do not match our criteria.
3. Respondents ""54"", ""82"", and ""37"" are all from group ""C"" (Middle), but none of them rated 'System_Complexity' as 2.

Therefore, the only respondent from the 'Middle' group who rated 'System_Complexity' as 2 is respondent ""22"".

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents who rated 'Inconsistency' and 'Integration_of_Functions' with the same score.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to iterate through each respondent's answers in the 'responses' section and check if the scores for 'Inconsistency' and 'Integration_of_Functions' are the same.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents who rated 'Ease_of_Learning' and 'System_Complexity' with the same score.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to iterate through each respondent's answers in the 'responses' section and check if the scores for 'Ease_of_Learning' and 'System_Complexity' are the same.

After analyzing the data, the respondents who rated 'Ease_of_Learning' and 'System_Complexity' with the same score are: 71, 10, 45, 77, 37, 51, 54, 3. 

These respondents have the same score for 'Ease_of_Learning' and 'System_Complexity'.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose combined score for 'Cumbersome_to_Use' and 'Frequent_Usage' is less than 6.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to iterate through each respondent's answers in the 'responses' section and check their scores for 'Cumbersome_to_Use' and 'Frequent_Usage'. We then need to identify those respondents whose combined score for these two questions is less than 6.

Given data:

- Respondent 70: 'Cumbersome_to_Use' = 1, 'Frequent_Usage' = 5, Combined = 6
- Respondent 38: 'Cumbersome_to_Use' = 1, 'Frequent_Usage' = 3, Combined = 4
- Respondent 79: 'Cumbersome_to_Use' = 1, 'Frequent_Usage' = 5, Combined = 6
- Respondent 4: 'Cumbersome_to_Use' = 1, 'Frequent_Usage' = 4, Combined = 5
- Respondent 80: 'Cumbersome_to_Use' = 1, 'Frequent_Usage' = 5, Combined = 6

From the given data, the respondents whose combined score for 'Cumbersome_to_Use' and 'Frequent_Usage' is less than 6 are:

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Find all respondents whose combined score for 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' and 'System_Complexity' is less than 3.
</task>","To find all respondents whose combined score for 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' and 'System_Complexity' is less than 3, we need to iterate through each response, add the scores for these two questions, and check if the sum is less than 3.

Given responses:
1. Respondent 10: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 2, 'System_Complexity' = 1, Sum = 3
2. Respondent 28: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 4, 'System_Complexity' = 1, Sum = 5
3. Respondent 19: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 2, 'System_Complexity' = 1, Sum = 3
4. Respondent 39: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 4, 'System_Complexity' = 4, Sum = 8
5. Respondent 90: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 1, 'System_Complexity' = 1, Sum = 2
6. Respondent 31: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 1, 'System_Complexity' = 1, Sum = 2
7. Respondent 64: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 5, 'System_Complexity' = 3, Sum = 8
8. Respondent 4: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 1, 'System_Complexity' = 1, Sum = 2
9. Respondent 5: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 1, 'System_Complexity' = 1, Sum = 2

Respondents with a combined score less than 3 are:
- Respondent 90
- Respondent 31
- Respondent 4
- Respondent 5

Therefore, the list of respondents whose combined score for 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' and 'System_Complexity' is less than 3 is: 90, 31, 4, 5",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents who rated 'Confidence_in_Use' and 'Frequent_Usage' with the same score.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to iterate through each respondent's answers in the 'responses' section and check if the scores for 'Confidence_in_Use' and 'Frequent_Usage' are the same.

After analyzing the data, the respondents who rated 'Confidence_in_Use' and 'Frequent_Usage' with the same score are: 74, 81, 30, 36, 62, 84 

These respondents have the same score for 'Confidence_in_Use' and 'Frequent_Usage'.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose combined score for 'Integration_of_Functions' and 'Need_for_Technical_Support' is less than 6.
</task>","To find all respondents whose combined score for 'Integration_of_Functions' and 'Need_for_Technical_Support' is less than 6, we need to iterate through each respondent's answers in the 'responses' section and check the scores for these two questions.

Here are the steps and calculations:

1. For each respondent, add the scores of 'Integration_of_Functions' and 'Need_for_Technical_Support'.
2. Check if the sum is less than 6.
3. If the sum is less than 6, note the respondent's ID.

Let's perform these steps on the provided data:

- Respondent 43: Integration_of_Functions = 5, Need_for_Technical_Support = 1, Sum = 6 (not less than 6)
- Respondent 8: Integration_of_Functions = 5, Need_for_Technical_Support = 1, Sum = 6 (not less than 6)
- Respondent 3: Integration_of_Functions = 2, Need_for_Technical_Support = 1, Sum = 3 (less than 6)
- Respondent 37: Integration_of_Functions = 5, Need_for_Technical_Support = 2, Sum = 7 (not less than 6)
- Respondent 11: Integration_of_Functions = 5, Need_for_Technical_Support = 5, Sum = 10 (not less than 6)
- Respondent 1: Integration_of_Functions = 5, Need_for_Technical_Support = 1, Sum = 6 (not less than 6)
- Respondent 65: Integration_of_Functions = 2, Need_for_Technical_Support = 5, Sum = 7 (not less than 6)
- Respondent 81: Integration_of_Functions = 4, Need_for_Technical_Support = 2, Sum = 6 (not less than 6)
- Respondent 23: Integration_of_Functions = 4, Need_for_Technical_Support = 3, Sum = 7 (not less than 6)
- Respondent 32: Integration_of_Functions = 5, Need_for_Technical_Support = 1, Sum = 6 (not less than 6)

Only Respondent 3 has a combined score less than 6.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents from the 'Middle' group rated 'Inconsistency' as 3 and 'Cumbersome_to_Use' as 1?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to analyze the 'responses' section of the data and find the respondents who belong to the 'Middle' group, rated 'Inconsistency' as 3, and 'Cumbersome_to_Use' as 1.

From the 'questions' schema, we know that the 'Group' field is a MCQ with options A. Senior, B. Junior, C. Middle, D. Intern. So, we are looking for respondents with 'Group' = 'C'.

We iterate through the 'responses' and find the following respondents who match the criteria:

- Respondent ""88"" has 'Group' = 'C' (Middle), 'Inconsistency' = '3', but 'Cumbersome_to_Use' = '2', so this respondent does not match.
- Respondent ""5"" has 'Group' = 'C' (Middle), 'Inconsistency' = '1', and 'Cumbersome_to_Use' = '1', so this respondent does not match because 'Inconsistency' is not 3.
- No other respondents have 'Group' = 'C' (Middle), 'Inconsistency' = '3', and 'Cumbersome_to_Use' = '1'.

However, upon re-examining the data, we find that there are no respondents from the 'Middle' group who rated 'Inconsistency' as 3 and 'Cumbersome_to_Use' as 1. 

The final answer is: $\boxed{88}$",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents who rated 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' and 'Cumbersome_to_Use' with the same score.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'Inconsistency' score is higher than the average 'Inconsistency' score for their group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Inconsistency' score for each group, and then identify the respondents whose 'Inconsistency' score is higher than the average for their respective group.

Given the data, let's calculate the average 'Inconsistency' score for each group:

1. **Group A (Senior)**: Only respondent ""89"" is in this group with an 'Inconsistency' score of ""3"".
2. **Group B (Junior)**: Respondent ""36"" is in this group with an 'Inconsistency' score of ""1"".
3. **Group C (Middle)**: Respondents ""43"", ""50"", ""37"" are in this group with 'Inconsistency' scores of ""1"", ""2"", and ""1"" respectively.
4. **Group D (Intern)**: Respondents ""49"", ""30"", ""74"", ""71"" are in this group with 'Inconsistency' scores of ""4"", ""1"", ""3"", and ""2"" respectively.

Calculating the averages:
- **Group A**: 3 (since there's only one respondent)
- **Group B**: 1
- **Group C**: (1 + 2 + 1) / 3 = 4 / 3 = 1.33
- **Group D**: (4 + 1 + 3 + 2) / 4 = 10 / 4 = 2.5

Now, let's identify respondents whose 'Inconsistency' score is higher than the average for their group:
- **Group A**: None (since the average is based on a single respondent)
- **Group B**: None
- **Group C**: Respondent ""50"" with a score of ""2"" is higher than the average of 1.33.
- **Group D**: Respondent ""49"" with a score of ""4"" is higher than the average of 2.5.

Thus, the respondents whose 'Inconsistency' score is higher than the average for their group are:
50 

Note: The task asks for respondents, implying IDs or names. Since the data provides IDs (e.g., ""49"", ""43""), these will be used as the identifiers for the respondents in the answer.",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'Ease_of_Use' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score for their group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Ease_of_Use' score for each group and then identify the respondents whose 'Ease_of_Use' score is higher than the average for their respective group.

Given the data, let's calculate the average 'Ease_of_Use' score for each group:

1. **Group A (Senior)**: There are no respondents in this group.
2. **Group B (Junior)**:
   - Respondent 36: Ease_of_Use = 5
   - Respondent 32: Ease_of_Use = 5
   - Respondent 14: Ease_of_Use = 4
   - Average Ease_of_Use for Group B = (5 + 5 + 4) / 3 = 14 / 3 = 4.67
3. **Group C (Middle)**:
   - Respondent 82: Ease_of_Use = 4
   - Respondent 4: Ease_of_Use = 5
   - Respondent 87: Ease_of_Use = 3
   - Respondent 70: Ease_of_Use = 5
   - Average Ease_of_Use for Group C = (4 + 5 + 3 + 5) / 4 = 17 / 4 = 4.25
4. **Group D (Intern)**:
   - Respondent 15: Ease_of_Use = 4
   - Respondent 29: Ease_of_Use = 4
   - Respondent 18: Ease_of_Use = 4
   - Respondent 12: Ease_of_Use = 5
   - Average Ease_of_Use for Group D = (4 + 4 + 4 + 5) / 4 = 17 / 4 = 4.25

Now, let's identify the respondents whose 'Ease_of_Use' score is higher than the average for their group:

- **Group B (Junior)**: Average is 4.67. Respondents 36 and 32 have a score of 5, which is higher than the average.
- **Group C (Middle)**: Average is 4.25. Respondents 4 and 70 have a score of 5, which is higher than the average.
- **Group D (Intern)**: Average is 4.25. Respondent 12 has a score of 5, which is higher than the average.

Therefore, the respondents whose 'Ease_of_Use' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score for their group are: 36, 32, 4, 70, 12.",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondents have a total negative usability score ('System_Complexity' + 'Inconsistency' + 'Cumbersome_to_Use') that is higher than the average for their group?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the total negative usability score for each respondent, which is the sum of their 'System_Complexity', 'Inconsistency', and 'Cumbersome_to_Use' scores. Then, we need to calculate the average total negative usability score for each group. Finally, we compare each respondent's score to their group's average to find those with a higher score.

Given the data, let's perform these steps:

1. **Calculate Total Negative Usability Score for Each Respondent:**

   - Respondent 5: 1 (System_Complexity) + 1 (Inconsistency) + 1 (Cumbersome_to_Use) = 3
   - Respondent 37: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
   - Respondent 90: 1 + 2 + 2 = 5
   - Respondent 19: 1 + 1 + 2 = 4
   - Respondent 60: 1 + 2 + 1 = 4
   - Respondent 48: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
   - Respondent 86: 5 + 3 + 5 = 13
   - Respondent 13: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
   - Respondent 59: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
   - Respondent 77: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
   - Respondent 64: 3 + 4 + 4 = 11
   - Respondent 78: 1 + 4 + 2 = 7

2. **Determine Group for Each Respondent:**

   - Respondent 5: C (Middle)
   - Respondent 37: C (Middle)
   - Respondent 90: D (Intern)
   - Respondent 19: C (Middle)
   - Respondent 60: D (Intern)
   - Respondent 48: D (Intern)
   - Respondent 86: A (Senior)
   - Respondent 13: A (Senior)
   - Respondent 59: A (Senior)
   - Respondent 77: D (Intern)
   - Respondent 64: D (Intern)
   - Respondent 78: D (Intern)

3. **Calculate Average Total Negative Usability Score for Each Group:**

   - Group A (Senior): (13 + 3 + 3) / 3 = 19 / 3 = 6.33
   - Group C (Middle): (3 + 3 + 4) / 3 = 10 / 3 = 3.33
   - Group D (Intern): (5 + 4 + 3 + 3 + 11 + 7) / 6 = 33 / 6 = 5.5

4. **Identify Respondents with a Higher Score than Their Group's Average:**

   - Group A (Senior): Respondent 86 (13) is higher than 6.33
   - Group C (Middle): None
   - Group D (Intern): Respondents 90 (5) is not higher, 60 (4) is not higher, 48 (3) is not higher, 77 (3) is not higher, 64 (11) is higher than 5.5, and 78 (7) is higher than 5.5

Therefore, the respondents with a total negative usability score higher than the average for their group are:

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents in the 'Junior' group whose 'Ease_of_Learning' is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Learning' for the 'Middle' group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Ease_of_Learning' for the 'Middle' group and then identify all respondents in the 'Junior' group whose 'Ease_of_Learning' score is higher than this average.

1. **Identify 'Middle' group respondents and their 'Ease_of_Learning' scores:**
   - From the 'responses' section, we find respondents with ""Group"" = ""C"" (since 'Middle' corresponds to option C in the schema).
   - Respondents 53, 70 are in the 'Middle' group.
   - Their 'Ease_of_Learning' scores are 5 and 5, respectively.

2. **Calculate the average 'Ease_of_Learning' for the 'Middle' group:**
   - Average = (5 + 5) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5

3. **Identify 'Junior' group respondents and their 'Ease_of_Learning' scores:**
   - From the 'responses' section, we find the respondent with ""Group"" = ""B"" (since 'Junior' corresponds to option B in the schema).
   - Respondent 23 is in the 'Junior' group.
   - Their 'Ease_of_Learning' score is 4.

4. **Determine if the 'Junior' group respondent's 'Ease_of_Learning' is higher than the 'Middle' group average:**
   - Since 4 (the 'Ease_of_Learning' score of the 'Junior' group respondent) is not higher than 5 (the average 'Ease_of_Learning' for the 'Middle' group), there are no respondents in the 'Junior' group whose 'Ease_of_Learning' is higher than the average for the 'Middle' group.

Given the instructions and the analysis, the answer to the task is that there are no respondents that meet the specified criteria. However, following the format for output as requested:

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents in the 'Intern' group whose 'Confidence_in_Use' is higher than the average 'Confidence_in_Use' for the 'Junior' group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Confidence_in_Use' for the 'Junior' group. Then, we will identify all respondents in the 'Intern' group and check if their 'Confidence_in_Use' is higher than this average.

1. **Calculate the average 'Confidence_in_Use' for the 'Junior' group:**

From the 'questions' section, we understand that 'Group' is a MCQ field with options A. Senior, B. Junior, C. Middle, D. Intern. We are interested in option B, which corresponds to 'Junior'.

Looking at the 'responses', we find respondents who belong to the 'Junior' group (Group = ""B""):

- Respondent ""44"" with 'Confidence_in_Use' = ""1""
- Respondent ""3"" with 'Confidence_in_Use' = ""5""

The average 'Confidence_in_Use' for the 'Junior' group is (1 + 5) / 2 = 3.

2. **Identify all respondents in the 'Intern' group:**

From the 'questions' section, 'Intern' corresponds to option D.

Looking at the 'responses', we find the respondent who belongs to the 'Intern' group (Group = ""D""):

- Respondent ""10"" with 'Confidence_in_Use' = ""5""

3. **Check if 'Confidence_in_Use' for 'Intern' group respondents is higher than the average for 'Junior' group:**

Since the average 'Confidence_in_Use' for the 'Junior' group is 3, and respondent ""10"" from the 'Intern' group has a 'Confidence_in_Use' of 5, which is higher than 3, respondent ""10"" meets the criteria.

Therefore, the respondent in the 'Intern' group whose 'Confidence_in_Use' is higher than the average 'Confidence_in_Use' for the 'Junior' group is:

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondents have a total negative usability score ('System_Complexity' + 'Inconsistency' + 'Cumbersome_to_Use') that is higher than the average for their group?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the total negative usability score for each respondent, which is the sum of their scores for 'System_Complexity', 'Inconsistency', and 'Cumbersome_to_Use'. Then, we need to calculate the average total negative usability score for each group. Finally, we compare each respondent's score to their group's average to find those with a higher score.

Given the data, let's proceed step by step:

1. **Calculate Total Negative Usability Score for Each Respondent:**

Respondent 10: 1 (System_Complexity) + 1 (Inconsistency) + 1 (Cumbersome_to_Use) = 3
Respondent 52: 1 + 2 + 1 = 4
Respondent 6: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
Respondent 76: 1 + 2 + 2 = 5
Respondent 30: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
Respondent 82: 1 + 1 + 2 = 4
Respondent 67: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
Respondent 20: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3

2. **Determine Group for Each Respondent:**

Respondent 10: D (Intern)
Respondent 52: A (Senior)
Respondent 6: A (Senior)
Respondent 76: A (Senior)
Respondent 30: D (Intern)
Respondent 82: C (Middle)
Respondent 67: A (Senior)
Respondent 20: C (Middle)

3. **Calculate Average Total Negative Usability Score for Each Group:**

- **Group A (Senior):** (4 + 3 + 5 + 3) / 4 = 15 / 4 = 3.75
- **Group D (Intern):** (3 + 3) / 2 = 6 / 2 = 3
- **Group C (Middle):** (4 + 3) / 2 = 7 / 2 = 3.5

4. **Identify Respondents with a Total Negative Usability Score Higher Than Their Group's Average:**

- **Group A (Senior):** Respondent 76 (score: 5) and Respondent 52 (score: 4) have scores higher than the group average (3.75). Only Respondent 76 meets this criterion because 4 is not higher than 3.75, but since 5 is indeed higher, Respondent 76 qualifies.
- **Group D (Intern):** No respondents have a score higher than the group average (3).
- **Group C (Middle):** Respondent 82 (score: 4) has a score higher than the group average (3.5).

Therefore, the respondents with a total negative usability score higher than the average for their group are:

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents have a total negative usability score ('System_Complexity' + 'Inconsistency' + 'Cumbersome_to_Use') that is higher than the average for their group?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the total negative usability score for each respondent, which is the sum of their scores for 'System_Complexity', 'Inconsistency', and 'Cumbersome_to_Use'. Then, we need to calculate the average total negative usability score for each group. Finally, we compare each respondent's score to the average for their group to determine which respondents have a higher score.

Here are the steps with calculations:

1. **Calculate Total Negative Usability Score for Each Respondent:**

   - For each respondent, add the scores of 'System_Complexity', 'Inconsistency', and 'Cumbersome_to_Use'.

2. **Calculate Average Total Negative Usability Score for Each Group:**

   - Group the respondents by their 'Group' answer (A, B, C, D).
   - For each group, calculate the average total negative usability score.

3. **Identify Respondents with Higher Than Average Score:**

   - Compare each respondent's total negative usability score to the average score of their group.
   - List the respondents whose score is higher than the group's average.

Given the complexity and the need for precise calculations based on the provided data, let's proceed with the analysis:

### Step 1: Calculate Total Negative Usability Scores

Calculating for each respondent:
- Respondent 46: 1 (System_Complexity) + 2 (Inconsistency) + 1 (Cumbersome_to_Use) = 4
- Respondent 9: 3 + 5 + 3 = 11
- Respondent 56: 2 + 1 + 1 = 4
- Respondent 71: 1 + 2 + 1 = 4
- Respondent 59: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
- Respondent 74: 1 + 3 + 1 = 5
- Respondent 44: 2 + 1 + 1 = 4
- Respondent 33: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
- Respondent 66: 1 + 2 + 1 = 4
- Respondent 50: 1 + 2 + 2 = 5
- Respondent 51: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
- Respondent 79: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3

### Step 2: Calculate Average Total Negative Usability Score for Each Group

- **Group A (Senior):** Respondents 46, 56, 59
  - Total: 4 (46) + 4 (56) + 3 (59) = 11
  - Average: 11 / 3 = 3.67
- **Group B (Junior):** Respondents 44, 66, 79
  - Total: 4 (44) + 4 (66) + 3 (79) = 11
  - Average: 11 / 3 = 3.67
- **Group C (Middle):** Respondents 9, 33, 50, 51
  - Total: 11 (9) + 3 (33) + 5 (50) + 3 (51) = 22
  - Average: 22 / 4 = 5.5
- **Group D (Intern):** Respondents 71, 74
  - Total: 4 (71) + 5 (74) = 9
  - Average: 9 / 2 = 4.5

### Step 3: Identify Respondents with Higher Than Average Score

- **Group A:** None have a score higher than 3.67.
- **Group B:** None have a score higher than 3.67.
- **Group C:** Respondent 9 (score 11) and Respondent 50 (score 5) have scores higher than the average of 5.5. Only Respondent 9 meets this criterion.
- **Group D:** Respondent 74 (score 5) has a score higher than the average of 4.5.

Therefore, the respondents with a total negative usability score higher than the average for their group are:

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents in the 'Junior' group whose 'Ease_of_Use' is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' for the 'Middle' group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Ease_of_Use' for the 'Middle' group and then identify respondents in the 'Junior' group with an 'Ease_of_Use' score higher than this average.

1. **Calculate the average 'Ease_of_Use' for the 'Middle' group:**

From the data, respondents in the 'Middle' group have the following 'Ease_of_Use' scores:
- Respondent ""17"" has a score of ""5"".
- Respondent ""39"" has a score of ""1"".

The average 'Ease_of_Use' for the 'Middle' group is (5 + 1) / 2 = 3.

2. **Identify respondents in the 'Junior' group:**

The 'Junior' group corresponds to option ""B"" in the 'Group' question. From the data, the respondent in the 'Junior' group is:
- Respondent ""69"" with an 'Ease_of_Use' score of ""5"".

Since 5 is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' for the 'Middle' group (which is 3), respondent ""69"" meets the criteria.

Therefore, the respondent in the 'Junior' group whose 'Ease_of_Use' is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' for the 'Middle' group is:

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondents have a total negative usability score ('System_Complexity' + 'Inconsistency' + 'Cumbersome_to_Use') that is higher than the average for their group?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the total negative usability score for each respondent, which is the sum of 'System_Complexity', 'Inconsistency', and 'Cumbersome_to_Use'. Then, we need to calculate the average of this score for each group. Finally, we compare each respondent's score with the average score of their group to find those with a higher score.

Here are the steps with calculations:

1. **Calculate Total Negative Usability Score for Each Respondent:**

   - For each respondent, add the scores of 'System_Complexity', 'Inconsistency', and 'Cumbersome_to_Use'.

2. **Calculate Average Total Negative Usability Score for Each Group:**

   - Group the respondents by their 'Group' (A, B, C, D).
   - For each group, calculate the average total negative usability score.

3. **Identify Respondents with a Score Higher than Their Group's Average:**

   - Compare each respondent's total negative usability score with the average score of their group.
   - List the respondents whose score is higher than their group's average.

Given the complexity and the need for precise calculations based on the provided data, let's proceed with the analysis:

### Step 1: Calculate Total Negative Usability Score for Each Respondent

| Respondent | Group | System_Complexity | Inconsistency | Cumbersome_to_Use | Total Score |
|------------|-------|-------------------|---------------|-------------------|-------------|
| 9          | C     | 3                 | 5             | 3                 | 11          |
| 45         | D     | 1                 | 1             | 1                 | 3           |
| 53         | C     | 1                 | 1             | 1                 | 3           |
| 15         | D     | 2                 | 1             | 1                 | 4           |
| 42         | A     | 1                 | 1             | 1                 | 3           |
| 71         | D     | 1                 | 2             | 1                 | 4           |
| 66         | B     | 1                 | 2             | 1                 | 4           |
| 7          | D     | 1                 | 1             | 1                 | 3           |
| 88         | C     | 2                 | 3             | 2                 | 7           |
| 6          | A     | 1                 | 1             | 1                 | 3           |
| 36         | B     | 1                 | 1             | 1                 | 3           |

### Step 2: Calculate Average Total Negative Usability Score for Each Group

- **Group A:** (3 + 3) / 2 = 3
- **Group B:** (4 + 3) / 2 = 3.5
- **Group C:** (11 + 3 + 7) / 3 = 7
- **Group D:** (3 + 4 + 4 + 3) / 4 = 3.5

### Step 3: Identify Respondents with a Score Higher than Their Group's Average

- **Group A:** None (both scores are 3, which is the average)
- **Group B:** 66 (score of 4 is higher than the average of 3.5)
- **Group C:** 9, 88 (scores of 11 and 7 are higher than the average of 7)
- **Group D:** 15, 71 (scores of 4 are higher than the average of 3.5)

Therefore, the respondents with a total negative usability score higher than the average for their group are **9, 15, 66, 71, 88**.",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondents have a total negative usability score ('System_Complexity' + 'Inconsistency' + 'Cumbersome_to_Use') that is higher than the average for their group?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the total negative usability score for each respondent, which is the sum of 'System_Complexity', 'Inconsistency', and 'Cumbersome_to_Use'. Then, we need to calculate the average of this score for each group. Finally, we compare each respondent's score with the average score of their group to find out who has a higher score.

Here are the steps with calculations:

1. **Calculate Total Negative Usability Score for Each Respondent:**

   - Respondent 64: 3 (System_Complexity) + 4 (Inconsistency) + 4 (Cumbersome_to_Use) = 11
   - Respondent 35: 5 + 5 + 5 = 15
   - Respondent 47: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
   - Respondent 82: 1 + 1 + 2 = 4
   - Respondent 32: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
   - Respondent 89: 2 + 3 + 1 = 6
   - Respondent 61: 5 + 4 + 5 = 14
   - Respondent 43: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
   - Respondent 11: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3

2. **Group Respondents by Their Group and Calculate Average Total Negative Usability Score for Each Group:**

   - **Group A (Senior):** Respondents 35, 89, 11
     - Total: 15 (35) + 6 (89) + 3 (11) = 24
     - Average: 24 / 3 = 8
   - **Group B (Junior):** Respondents 47, 32, 61
     - Total: 3 (47) + 3 (32) + 14 (61) = 20
     - Average: 20 / 3 = 6.67
   - **Group C (Middle):** Respondents 82, 43
     - Total: 4 (82) + 3 (43) = 7
     - Average: 7 / 2 = 3.5
   - **Group D (Intern):** Respondent 64
     - Total: 11
     - Average: 11 / 1 = 11

3. **Identify Respondents with a Total Negative Usability Score Higher Than Their Group's Average:**

   - **Group A (Senior):** 
     - Respondent 35 (Score: 15) is higher than the group average (8).
     - Respondent 89 (Score: 6) is lower than the group average (8).
     - Respondent 11 (Score: 3) is lower than the group average (8).
   - **Group B (Junior):** 
     - Respondent 47 (Score: 3) is lower than the group average (6.67).
     - Respondent 32 (Score: 3) is lower than the group average (6.67).
     - Respondent 61 (Score: 14) is higher than the group average (6.67).
   - **Group C (Middle):** 
     - Respondent 82 (Score: 4) is higher than the group average (3.5).
     - Respondent 43 (Score: 3) is lower than the group average (3.5).
   - **Group D (Intern):** 
     - Since there's only one respondent in this group, their score is both the individual and group average, so they do not exceed the group average in the context of being higher.

**Respondents with a Total Negative Usability Score Higher Than Their Group's Average:**

- Respondent 35 (Group A)
- Respondent 61 (Group B)
- Respondent 82 (Group C)

Therefore, the respondents who have a total negative usability score higher than the average for their group are **35, 61, 82**.",False
