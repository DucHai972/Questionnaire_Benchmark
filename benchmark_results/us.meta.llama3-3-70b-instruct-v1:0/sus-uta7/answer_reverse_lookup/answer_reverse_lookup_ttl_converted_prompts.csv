</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents from the 'Middle' group rated 'Integration_of_Functions' as 3 and 'Confidence_in_Use' as 2?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to analyze the 'responses' section and find the respondents who belong to the 'Middle' group, rated 'Integration_of_Functions' as 3, and rated 'Confidence_in_Use' as 2.


From the 'questions' section, we know that the 'Middle' group corresponds to option ""C"" in the 'Group of the respondent' question.


After examining the 'responses' section, we find that:


- Respondent9 belongs to group ""C"" (which corresponds to 'Middle'), has 'Integration_of_Functions' rated as ""1"" (not 3), and 'Confidence_in_Use' rated as ""2"". This respondent does not meet the criteria because their 'Integration_of_Functions' rating is not 3.


- Respondent4 belongs to group ""C"" (which corresponds to 'Middle'), has 'Integration_of_Functions' rated as ""3"", and 'Confidence_in_Use' rated as ""5"" (not 2). This respondent does not meet the criteria because their 'Confidence_in_Use' rating is not 2.


- Respondent50 belongs to group ""C"" (which corresponds to 'Middle'), has 'Integration_of_Functions' rated as ""5"" (not 3), and 'Confidence_in_Use' rated as ""4"" (not 2). This respondent does not meet the criteria because both ratings are incorrect.


- Respondent40 belongs to group ""C"" (which corresponds to 'Middle'), has 'Integration_of_Functions' rated as ""4"" (not 3), and 'Confidence_in_Use' rated as ""5"" (not 2). This respondent does not meet the criteria because both ratings are incorrect.


None of the respondents from the 'Middle' group rated 'Integration_of_Functions' as 3 and 'Confidence_in_Use' as 2.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents who rated 'Ease_of_Use' and 'Ease_of_Learning' with the same score.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to analyze the 'responses' section and find the respondents who rated 'Ease_of_Use' and 'Ease_of_Learning' with the same score.

From the 'questions' section, we know that 'Ease_of_Use' and 'Ease_of_Learning' are both Likert scale questions with scores ranging from 1 to 5.

After analyzing the 'responses' section, we can see that the following respondents rated 'Ease_of_Use' and 'Ease_of_Learning' with the same score:

Respondent17: Ease_of_Use = 5, Ease_of_Learning = 5
Respondent33: Ease_of_Use = 5, Ease_of_Learning = 5
Respondent37: Ease_of_Use = 5, Ease_of_Learning = 5
Respondent43: Ease_of_Use = 5, Ease_of_Learning = 3 (does not match)
Respondent44: Ease_of_Use = 5, Ease_of_Learning = 3 (does not match)
Respondent56: Ease_of_Use = 4, Ease_of_Learning = 5 (does not match)

Respondent71: Ease_of_Use = 5, Ease_of_Learning = 5
Respondent73: Ease_of_Use = 4, Ease_of_Learning = 5 (does not match)

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose combined score for 'Integration_of_Functions' and 'Need_for_Technical_Support' is less than 6.
</task>","To find all respondents whose combined score for 'Integration_of_Functions' and 'Need_for_Technical_Support' is less than 6, we need to examine each respondent's data in the 'responses' section and calculate the sum of these two scores for each respondent.


After reviewing the data:


- Respondent43: Integration_of_Functions = 5, Need_for_Technical_Support = 1, Sum = 6
- Respondent8: Integration_of_Functions = 5, Need_for_Technical_Support = 1, Sum = 6
- Respondent3: Integration_of_Functions = 2, Need_for_Technical_Support = 1, Sum = 3
- Respondent37: Integration_of_Functions = 5, Need_for_Technical_Support = 2, Sum = 7
- Respondent11: Integration_of_Functions = 5, Need_for_Technical_Support = 5, Sum = 10
- Respondent1: Integration_of_Functions = 5, Need_for_Technical_Support = 1, Sum = 6
- Respondent65: Integration_of_Functions = 2, Need_for_Technical_Support = 5, Sum = 7
- Respondent81: Integration_of_Functions = 4, Need_for_Technical_Support = 2, Sum = 6
- Respondent23: Integration_of_Functions = 4, Need_for_Technical_Support = 3, Sum = 7

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'Inconsistency' score is higher than the average 'Inconsistency' score for their group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Inconsistency' score for each group and then identify the respondents whose 'Inconsistency' score is higher than the average for their respective group.

Given the data, let's calculate the average 'Inconsistency' score for each group:

1. **Group A**: Only Respondent89 belongs to this group with an 'Inconsistency' score of ""3"".
2. **Group B**: Respondent36 belongs to this group with an 'Inconsistency' score of ""1"".
3. **Group C**: Respondents 43, 22, 50, and 37 belong to this group with 'Inconsistency' scores of ""1"", ""5"", ""2"", and ""1"" respectively.
4. **Group D**: Respondents 49, 30, 74, and 71 belong to this group with 'Inconsistency' scores of ""4"", ""1"", ""3"", and ""2"" respectively.

Calculating the averages:
- **Group A**: (3) / 1 = 3
- **Group B**: (1) / 1 = 1
- **Group C**: (1 + 5 + 2 + 1) / 4 = 9 / 4 = 2.25
- **Group D**: (4 + 1 + 3 + 2) / 4 = 10 / 4 = 2.5

Now, let's identify respondents whose 'Inconsistency' score is higher than the average for their group:
- **Group A**: None, since the only respondent has a score equal to the average.
- **Group B**: None, since the only respondent has a score equal to the average.
- **Group C**: Respondent22 with a score of ""5"" is higher than the group average of 2.25.
- **Group D**: Respondent49 with a score of ""4"" is higher than the group average of 2.5.

Therefore, the respondents whose 'Inconsistency' score is higher than the average 'Inconsistency' score for their group are:
Respondent22, Respondent49",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'Ease_of_Use' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score for their group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Ease_of_Use' score for each group and then identify the respondents whose 'Ease_of_Use' score is higher than the average for their respective group.

1. **Calculate the average 'Ease_of_Use' score for each group:**

From the 'questions' section, we understand that the 'Group' is categorized as A. Senior, B. Junior, C. Middle, D. Intern. We will calculate the average 'Ease_of_Use' score for each of these groups based on the 'responses' section.

- **Group A (Senior):** There are no respondents in this group, so we cannot calculate an average.
- **Group B (Junior):**
  - Respondent36: Ease_of_Use = 5
  - Respondent32: Ease_of_Use = 5
  - Respondent14: Ease_of_Use = 4
  Average for Group B = (5 + 5 + 4) / 3 = 14 / 3 = 4.67
- **Group C (Middle):**
  - Respondent82: Ease_of_Use = 4
  - Respondent4: Ease_of_Use = 5
  - Respondent87: Ease_of_Use = 3
  - Respondent70: Ease_of_Use = 5
  Average for Group C = (4 + 5 + 3 + 5) / 4 = 17 / 4 = 4.25
- **Group D (Intern):**
  - Respondent15: Ease_of_Use = 4
  - Respondent29: Ease_of_Use = 4
  - Respondent18: Ease_of_Use = 4
  - Respondent12: Ease_of_Use = 5
  Average for Group D = (4 + 4 + 4 + 5) / 4 = 17 / 4 = 4.25

2. **Identify respondents whose 'Ease_of_Use' score is higher than the average for their group:**

- **Group B (Junior):** Average = 4.67
  - Respondent36: Ease_of_Use = 5 (Higher)
  - Respondent32: Ease_of_Use = 5 (Higher)
  - Respondent14: Ease_of_Use = 4 (Not Higher)
- **Group C (Middle):** Average = 4.25
  - Respondent82: Ease_of_Use = 4 (Not Higher)
  - Respondent4: Ease_of_Use = 5 (Higher)
  - Respondent87: Ease_of_Use = 3 (Not Higher)
  - Respondent70: Ease_of_Use = 5 (Higher)
- **Group D (Intern):** Average = 4.25
  - Respondent15: Ease_of_Use = 4 (Not Higher)
  - Respondent29: Ease_of_Use = 4 (Not Higher)
  - Respondent18: Ease_of_Use = 4 (Not Higher)
  - Respondent12: Ease_of_Use = 5 (Higher)

**Respondents whose 'Ease_of_Use' score is higher than the average for their group:**

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents have a total negative usability score ('System_Complexity' + 'Inconsistency' + 'Cumbersome_to_Use') that is higher than the average for their group?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the total negative usability score for each respondent, which is the sum of their 'System_Complexity', 'Inconsistency', and 'Cumbersome_to_Use' scores. Then, we need to calculate the average total negative usability score for each group. Finally, we compare each respondent's score to their group's average to find those with a higher score.

### Step 1: Calculate Total Negative Usability Score for Each Respondent

We calculate the total negative usability score for each respondent by summing their scores for 'System_Complexity', 'Inconsistency', and 'Cumbersome_to_Use'.

### Step 2: Calculate Average Total Negative Usability Score for Each Group

We group the respondents by their 'Group' and calculate the average total negative usability score for each group.

### Step 3: Identify Respondents with Higher Scores Than Their Group's Average

We compare each respondent's total negative usability score to the average score of their group to identify those with a higher score.

Given the complexity and the need for precise calculations based on the provided data, let's analyze the data step by step:

1. **Calculate Total Negative Usability Scores:**

   - Respondent5: 1 (System_Complexity) + 1 (Inconsistency) + 1 (Cumbersome_to_Use) = 3
   - Respondent37: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
   - Respondent90: 1 + 2 + 2 = 5
   - Respondent19: 1 + 1 + 2 = 4
   - Respondent60: 1 + 2 + 1 = 4
   - Respondent48: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
   - Respondent86: 5 + 3 + 5 = 13
   - Respondent13: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
   - Respondent59: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
   - Respondent77: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
   - Respondent64: 3 + 4 + 4 = 11
   - Respondent78: 1 + 4 + 2 = 7

2. **Group Respondents and Calculate Group Averages:**

   - **Group A:** Respondent86 (13), Respondent13 (3), Respondent59 (3)
     - Average = (13 + 3 + 3) / 3 = 19 / 3 = 6.33
   - **Group C:** Respondent5 (3), Respondent37 (3), Respondent19 (4)
     - Average = (3 + 3 + 4) / 3 = 10 / 3 = 3.33
   - **Group D:** Respondent90 (5), Respondent60 (4), Respondent48 (3), Respondent77 (3), Respondent64 (11), Respondent78 (7)
     - Average = (5 + 4 + 3 + 3 + 11 + 7) / 6 = 33 / 6 = 5.5

3. **Identify Respondents with Scores Higher Than Their Group's Average:**

   - **Group A:** Respondent86 (13) is higher than 6.33.
   - **Group C:** Respondent19 (4) is higher than 3.33.
   - **Group D:** Respondent64 (11) and Respondent78 (7) are higher than 5.5.

Therefore, the respondents with a total negative usability score higher than the average for their group are:

Respondent86, Respondent19, Respondent64, Respondent78",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents in the 'Junior' group whose 'Ease_of_Learning' is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Learning' for the 'Middle' group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Ease_of_Learning' for the 'Middle' group and then identify respondents in the 'Junior' group with an 'Ease_of_Learning' score higher than this average.

1. **Identify 'Middle' group respondents and their 'Ease_of_Learning' scores:**
   - Respondent53: Group ""C"" (Middle), Ease_of_Learning ""5""
   - Respondent70: Group ""C"" (Middle), Ease_of_Learning ""5""

2. **Calculate the average 'Ease_of_Learning' for the 'Middle' group:**
   - Average = (5 + 5) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5

3. **Identify 'Junior' group respondents and their 'Ease_of_Learning' scores:**
   - Respondent23: Group ""B"" (Junior), Ease_of_Learning ""4""

4. **Determine which 'Junior' group respondents have an 'Ease_of_Learning' score higher than the 'Middle' group average:**
   - Since the average 'Ease_of_Learning' for the 'Middle' group is 5, and Respondent23 has a score of 4, there are no respondents in the 'Junior' group with an 'Ease_of_Learning' score higher than the average for the 'Middle' group.

Given the provided data and the task, the answer is based on the comparison and calculation above. However, the question asks for a list of respondents, but since there are no respondents that meet the criteria, the list is empty. Following the format for output, when the question asks for a list but there are no items to list, it seems most appropriate to indicate that directly.

The final answer is: $\boxed{0}$",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents in the 'Intern' group whose 'Confidence_in_Use' is higher than the average 'Confidence_in_Use' for the 'Junior' group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to follow the instructions and analyze the data step by step.

1. **Identify the 'Intern' and 'Junior' Groups**: 
   - From the schema, `:QGroup` defines the groups as ""[MCQ: A. Senior B. Junior C. Middle D. Intern]"". 
   - Thus, 'Intern' corresponds to ""D"" and 'Junior' corresponds to ""B"".

2. **Find Respondents in the 'Intern' Group**:
   - We look for respondents with `pred:Group ""D""`.
   - From the data, only `:Respondent10` has `pred:Group ""D""`.

3. **Calculate the Average 'Confidence_in_Use' for the 'Junior' Group**:
   - We look for respondents with `pred:Group ""B""`.
   - The respondents in the 'Junior' group are `:Respondent44` and `:Respondent3`.
   - Their `pred:Confidence_in_Use` values are ""1"" and ""5"", respectively.
   - The average `Confidence_in_Use` for the 'Junior' group is `(1 + 5) / 2 = 3`.

4. **Find Respondents in the 'Intern' Group with 'Confidence_in_Use' Higher than the Average for 'Junior'**:
   - The average `Confidence_in_Use` for the 'Junior' group is 3.
   - `:Respondent10` has `pred:Confidence_in_Use ""5""`, which is higher than 3.

Therefore, the respondent in the 'Intern' group with 'Confidence_in_Use' higher than the average for the 'Junior' group is `:Respondent10`. 

The final answer is: $\boxed{Respondent10}$",True
case_46,answer_reverse_lookup,Which respondents have a total negative usability score ('System_Complexity' + 'Inconsistency' + 'Cumbersome_to_Use') that is higher than the average for their group?,"@prefix : <http://example.org/survey#> .

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents have a total negative usability score ('System_Complexity' + 'Inconsistency' + 'Cumbersome_to_Use') that is higher than the average for their group?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the total negative usability score for each respondent, which is the sum of 'System_Complexity', 'Inconsistency', and 'Cumbersome_to_Use'. Then, we calculate the average of this score for each group. Finally, we identify the respondents whose total negative usability score is higher than the average for their group.

### Step 1: Calculate Total Negative Usability Score for Each Respondent

We calculate the total negative usability score for each respondent by summing 'System_Complexity', 'Inconsistency', and 'Cumbersome_to_Use'.

- Respondent10: 1 (System_Complexity) + 1 (Inconsistency) + 1 (Cumbersome_to_Use) = 3
- Respondent52: 1 + 2 + 1 = 4
- Respondent6: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
- Respondent76: 1 + 2 + 2 = 5
- Respondent30: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
- Respondent82: 1 + 1 + 2 = 4
- Respondent67: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
- Respondent20: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3

### Step 2: Determine Group for Each Respondent

Based on the 'Group' predicate, we determine the group for each respondent.

- Respondent10: D (Intern)
- Respondent52: A (Senior)
- Respondent6: A (Senior)
- Respondent76: A (Senior)
- Respondent30: D (Intern)
- Respondent82: C (Middle)
- Respondent67: A (Senior)
- Respondent20: C (Middle)

### Step 3: Calculate Average Total Negative Usability Score for Each Group

Now, we calculate the average total negative usability score for each group.

- Group A (Senior): (4 + 3 + 5 + 3) / 4 = 15 / 4 = 3.75
- Group C (Middle): (4 + 3) / 2 = 7 / 2 = 3.5
- Group D (Intern): (3 + 3) / 2 = 6 / 2 = 3

### Step 4: Identify Respondents with Higher Than Average Score for Their Group

We compare each respondent's total negative usability score to the average for their group.

- Respondent10 (D): 3 (lower than or equal to the group average)
- Respondent52 (A): 4 (higher than the group average)
- Respondent6 (A): 3 (lower than the group average)
- Respondent76 (A): 5 (higher than the group average)
- Respondent30 (D): 3 (lower than or equal to the group average)
- Respondent82 (C): 4 (higher than the group average)
- Respondent67 (A): 3 (lower than the group average)
- Respondent20 (C): 3 (lower than the group average)

Respondents with a total negative usability score higher than the average for their group are:

Respondent52, Respondent76, Respondent82

The final answer is: $\boxed{Respondent52, Respondent76, Respondent82}$",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents have a total negative usability score ('System_Complexity' + 'Inconsistency' + 'Cumbersome_to_Use') that is higher than the average for their group?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the total negative usability score for each respondent, which is the sum of their 'System_Complexity', 'Inconsistency', and 'Cumbersome_to_Use' scores. Then, we need to calculate the average total negative usability score for each group. Finally, we compare each respondent's score to their group's average to find those with a higher score.

### Step 1: Calculate Total Negative Usability Score for Each Respondent

We calculate the total negative usability score for each respondent by summing their scores for 'System_Complexity', 'Inconsistency', and 'Cumbersome_to_Use'.

### Step 2: Calculate Average Total Negative Usability Score for Each Group

We group the respondents by their 'Group' and calculate the average total negative usability score for each group.

### Step 3: Identify Respondents with Higher Scores Than Their Group's Average

We compare each respondent's total negative usability score to the average score of their group to identify those with a higher score.

Given the complexity and the need for precise calculations based on the provided data, let's analyze the data step by step:

1. **Calculate Total Negative Usability Scores:**

   - Respondent46: 1 (System_Complexity) + 2 (Inconsistency) + 1 (Cumbersome_to_Use) = 4
   - Respondent9: 3 + 5 + 3 = 11
   - Respondent56: 2 + 1 + 1 = 4
   - Respondent71: 1 + 2 + 1 = 4
   - Respondent59: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
   - Respondent74: 1 + 3 + 1 = 5
   - Respondent44: 2 + 1 + 1 = 4
   - Respondent33: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
   - Respondent66: 1 + 2 + 1 = 4
   - Respondent50: 1 + 2 + 2 = 5
   - Respondent51: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
   - Respondent79: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3

2. **Group Respondents and Calculate Group Averages:**

   - **Group A:** Respondent46 (4), Respondent56 (4), Respondent59 (3)
     - Average = (4 + 4 + 3) / 3 = 11 / 3 = 3.67
   - **Group B:** Respondent44 (4), Respondent66 (4), Respondent79 (3)
     - Average = (4 + 4 + 3) / 3 = 11 / 3 = 3.67
   - **Group C:** Respondent9 (11), Respondent33 (3), Respondent50 (5), Respondent51 (3)
     - Average = (11 + 3 + 5 + 3) / 4 = 22 / 4 = 5.5
   - **Group D:** Respondent71 (4), Respondent74 (5)
     - Average = (4 + 5) / 2 = 9 / 2 = 4.5

3. **Identify Respondents with Scores Higher Than Their Group's Average:**

   - **Group A:** None (all scores are around or below the average)
   - **Group B:** None (all scores are around or below the average)
   - **Group C:** Respondent9 (score of 11 is higher than the average of 5.5)
   - **Group D:** Respondent74 (score of 5 is higher than the average of 4.5)

Based on the calculations, the respondents with a total negative usability score higher than the average for their group are:

- Respondent9
- Respondent74

Therefore, the answer is: Respondent9, Respondent74",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents in the 'Junior' group whose 'Ease_of_Use' is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' for the 'Middle' group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Ease_of_Use' for the 'Middle' group and then identify respondents in the 'Junior' group with an 'Ease_of_Use' score higher than this average.

1. **Identify 'Middle' group respondents and their 'Ease_of_Use' scores:**
   - Respondent17: Group ""C"" (Middle), Ease_of_Use ""5""
   - Respondent39: Group ""C"" (Middle), Ease_of_Use ""1""

2. **Calculate the average 'Ease_of_Use' for the 'Middle' group:**
   - Average = (5 + 1) / 2 = 3

3. **Identify 'Junior' group respondents and their 'Ease_of_Use' scores:**
   - Respondent69: Group ""B"" (Junior), Ease_of_Use ""5""

4. **Find 'Junior' group respondents with 'Ease_of_Use' higher than the 'Middle' group average (3):**
   - Respondent69 has an Ease_of_Use of ""5"", which is higher than 3.

Therefore, the respondent in the 'Junior' group with an 'Ease_of_Use' higher than the average for the 'Middle' group is:

Respondent69",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents have a total negative usability score ('System_Complexity' + 'Inconsistency' + 'Cumbersome_to_Use') that is higher than the average for their group?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the total negative usability score for each respondent, which is the sum of 'System_Complexity', 'Inconsistency', and 'Cumbersome_to_Use'. Then, we calculate the average of this score for each group. Finally, we identify the respondents whose total negative usability score is higher than the average for their group.

### Step 1: Calculate Total Negative Usability Score for Each Respondent

We calculate the total negative usability score for each respondent by summing 'System_Complexity', 'Inconsistency', and 'Cumbersome_to_Use'.

### Step 2: Calculate Average Total Negative Usability Score for Each Group

We group the respondents by their 'Group' and calculate the average total negative usability score for each group.

### Step 3: Identify Respondents with Higher Than Average Score

We compare each respondent's total negative usability score with the average score of their group and list those with a higher score.

Given the complexity and the need for precise calculation based on the provided data, let's proceed with the actual calculations:

1. **Calculate Total Negative Usability Score for Each Respondent:**

   - Respondent9: 3 (System_Complexity) + 5 (Inconsistency) + 3 (Cumbersome_to_Use) = 11
   - Respondent45: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
   - Respondent53: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
   - Respondent15: 2 + 1 + 1 = 4
   - Respondent42: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
   - Respondent71: 1 + 2 + 1 = 4
   - Respondent66: 1 + 2 + 1 = 4
   - Respondent7: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
   - Respondent88: 2 + 3 + 2 = 7
   - Respondent6: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
   - Respondent36: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3

2. **Group Respondents and Calculate Average Total Negative Usability Score:**

   - Group A: (Respondent42: 3, Respondent6: 3) Average = (3 + 3) / 2 = 3
   - Group B: (Respondent66: 4, Respondent36: 3) Average = (4 + 3) / 2 = 3.5
   - Group C: (Respondent9: 11, Respondent53: 3, Respondent88: 7) Average = (11 + 3 + 7) / 3 = 7
   - Group D: (Respondent45: 3, Respondent15: 4, Respondent71: 4, Respondent7: 3) Average = (3 + 4 + 4 + 3) / 4 = 3.5

3. **Identify Respondents with Higher Than Average Score:**

   - Group A: None
   - Group B: Respondent66 (Score: 4, Average: 3.5) -> Yes
   - Group C: Respondent9 (Score: 11, Average: 7) -> Yes, Respondent88 (Score: 7, Average: 7) -> No
   - Group D: Respondent15 (Score: 4, Average: 3.5) -> Yes, Respondent71 (Score: 4, Average: 3.5) -> Yes

**Respondents with a total negative usability score higher than the average for their group are:**

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondents have a total negative usability score ('System_Complexity' + 'Inconsistency' + 'Cumbersome_to_Use') that is higher than the average for their group?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the total negative usability score for each respondent, which is the sum of 'System_Complexity', 'Inconsistency', and 'Cumbersome_to_Use' scores. Then, we calculate the average of this total score for each group. Finally, we identify the respondents whose total negative usability score is higher than the average for their respective group.

### Step 1: Calculate Total Negative Usability Score for Each Respondent

We calculate the total negative usability score for each respondent by summing their 'System_Complexity', 'Inconsistency', and 'Cumbersome_to_Use' scores.

### Step 2: Calculate Average Total Negative Usability Score for Each Group

We group the respondents by their 'Group' and calculate the average total negative usability score for each group.

### Step 3: Identify Respondents with Higher Than Average Total Negative Usability Score

We compare each respondent's total negative usability score with the average score of their group and list those with a higher score.

Given the complexity and the need for precise calculations based on the provided data, let's proceed with the analysis:

1. **Calculate Total Negative Usability Score for Each Respondent:**

   - Respondent64: 3 (System_Complexity) + 4 (Inconsistency) + 4 (Cumbersome_to_Use) = 11
   - Respondent35: 5 + 5 + 5 = 15
   - Respondent47: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
   - Respondent82: 1 + 1 + 2 = 4
   - Respondent32: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
   - Respondent89: 2 + 3 + 1 = 6
   - Respondent61: 5 + 4 + 5 = 14
   - Respondent43: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
   - Respondent11: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3

2. **Group Respondents and Calculate Average Total Negative Usability Score:**

   - **Group A:** Respondent35 (15), Respondent89 (6), Respondent11 (3)
     - Average = (15 + 6 + 3) / 3 = 24 / 3 = 8
   - **Group B:** Respondent47 (3), Respondent32 (3), Respondent61 (14)
     - Average = (3 + 3 + 14) / 3 = 20 / 3 = 6.67
   - **Group C:** Respondent82 (4), Respondent43 (3)
     - Average = (4 + 3) / 2 = 7 / 2 = 3.5
   - **Group D:** Respondent64 (11)
     - Average = 11 (since there's only one respondent in this group)

3. **Identify Respondents with Higher Than Average Score:**

   - **Group A:** Respondent35 (15) has a higher score than the average (8).
   - **Group B:** Respondent61 (14) has a higher score than the average (6.67).
   - **Group C:** None have a score higher than the average (3.5).
   - **Group D:** Since Respondent64 is the only member, they are their own average.

**Respondents with a total negative usability score higher than the average for their group are:**

Respondent35, Respondent61

These respondents have scores that exceed the average total negative usability score for their respective groups.",False
