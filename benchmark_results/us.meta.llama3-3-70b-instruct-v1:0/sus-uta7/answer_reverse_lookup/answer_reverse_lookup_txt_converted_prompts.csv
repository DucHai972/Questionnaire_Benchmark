</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Find all respondents whose combined score for 'Cumbersome_to_Use' and 'Frequent_Usage' is less than 6.
</task>","To find all respondents whose combined score for 'Cumbersome_to_Use' and 'Frequent_Usage' is less than 6, we need to examine each respondent's scores for these two questions and sum them up.

1. Respondent 70: Cumbersome_to_Use = 1, Frequent_Usage = 5, Combined score = 6
2. Respondent 38: Cumbersome_to_Use = 1, Frequent_Usage = 3, Combined score = 4
3. Respondent 79: Cumbersome_to_Use = 1, Frequent_Usage = 5, Combined score = 6
4. Respondent 4: Cumbersome_to_Use = 1, Frequent_Usage = 4, Combined score = 5
5. Respondent 80: Cumbersome_to_Use = 1, Frequent_Usage = 5, Combined score = 6

From the calculations, we can see that:

- Respondent 38 has a combined score of 4, which is less than 6.
- Respondent 4 has a combined score of 5, which is less than 6.

Therefore, the respondents whose combined score for 'Cumbersome_to_Use' and 'Frequent_Usage' is less than 6 are Respondent 38, Respondent 4.",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'Inconsistency' score is higher than the average 'Inconsistency' score for their group.
</task>","To find all respondents whose 'Inconsistency' score is higher than the average 'Inconsistency' score for their group, we first need to calculate the average 'Inconsistency' score for each group.

Group A:
- Respondent 89: Inconsistency = 3
Average for Group A = 3

Group B:
- Respondent 36: Inconsistency = 1
Average for Group B = 1

Group C:
- Respondent 43: Inconsistency = 1
- Respondent 22: Inconsistency = 5
- Respondent 50: Inconsistency = 2
- Respondent 37: Inconsistency = 1
Average for Group C = (1 + 5 + 2 + 1) / 4 = 9 / 4 = 2.25

Group D:
- Respondent 49: Inconsistency = 4
- Respondent 30: Inconsistency = 1
- Respondent 74: Inconsistency = 3
- Respondent 71: Inconsistency = 2
Average for Group D = (4 + 1 + 3 + 2) / 4 = 10 / 4 = 2.5

Now, we compare each respondent's 'Inconsistency' score to their group's average:

Group A:
- Respondent 89: 3 == 3 (not higher)

Group B:
- Respondent 36: 1 == 1 (not higher)

Group C:
- Respondent 43: 1 < 2.25
- Respondent 22: 5 > 2.25
- Respondent 50: 2 < 2.25
- Respondent 37: 1 < 2.25
Respondent 22 has a higher 'Inconsistency' score than the group average.

Group D:
- Respondent 49: 4 > 2.5
- Respondent 30: 1 < 2.5
- Respondent 74: 3 > 2.5
- Respondent 71: 2 < 2.5
Respondents 49 and 74 have higher 'Inconsistency' scores than the group average.

Therefore, the respondents whose 'Inconsistency' score is higher than the average 'Inconsistency' score for their group are:

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'Ease_of_Use' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score for their group.
</task>","To find all respondents whose 'Ease_of_Use' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score for their group, we first need to calculate the average 'Ease_of_Use' score for each group and then compare each respondent's score against this average.

Given the data:

1. Group A (Senior) has no respondents in the provided data.
2. Group B (Junior) respondents: 36, 32, 14
   - Respondent 36: Ease_of_Use = 5
   - Respondent 32: Ease_of_Use = 5
   - Respondent 14: Ease_of_Use = 4
   - Average Ease_of_Use for Group B = (5 + 5 + 4) / 3 = 14 / 3 = 4.67
3. Group C (Middle) respondents: 82, 4, 87, 70
   - Respondent 82: Ease_of_Use = 4
   - Respondent 4: Ease_of_Use = 5
   - Respondent 87: Ease_of_Use = 3
   - Respondent 70: Ease_of_Use = 5
   - Average Ease_of_Use for Group C = (4 + 5 + 3 + 5) / 4 = 17 / 4 = 4.25
4. Group D (Intern) respondents: 15, 29, 18, 12
   - Respondent 15: Ease_of_Use = 4
   - Respondent 29: Ease_of_Use = 4
   - Respondent 18: Ease_of_Use = 4
   - Respondent 12: Ease_of_Use = 5
   - Average Ease_of_Use for Group D = (4 + 4 + 4 + 5) / 4 = 17 / 4 = 4.25

Now, comparing each respondent's 'Ease_of_Use' score to their group's average:

- Group B (Junior):
  - Respondent 36: 5 > 4.67 (No, because it's not higher than the average, it's equal or higher but since it's exactly the same as the highest score in the group, it might seem like it belongs, but given the instruction, we are looking for scores strictly higher than the group average, which in this context means we should consider scores that exceed the average, not just meet or slightly exceed it due to rounding. However, given the nature of the question, we should include those who are above the average when considering discrete scores like these.)
  - Respondent 32: 5 > 4.67 (Same reasoning as above)
  - Respondent 14: 4 < 4.67 (Does not meet the criteria)
- Group C (Middle):
  - Respondent 82: 4 < 4.25 (Does not meet the criteria)
  - Respondent 4: 5 > 4.25 (Meets the criteria)
  - Respondent 87: 3 < 4.25 (Does not meet the criteria)
  - Respondent 70: 5 > 4.25 (Meets the criteria)
- Group D (Intern):
  - Respondent 15: 4 < 4.25 (Does not meet the criteria)
  - Respondent 29: 4 < 4.25 (Does not meet the criteria)
  - Respondent 18: 4 < 4.25 (Does not meet the criteria)
  - Respondent 12: 5 > 4.25 (Meets the criteria)

Therefore, the respondents whose 'Ease_of_Use' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score for their group are:
- Respondent 32
- Respondent 4
- Respondent 70
- Respondent 12

And also including Respondent 36 because, upon reconsideration, scores of 5 in Group B should indeed be considered as meeting the criteria given the context of discrete scores and the nature of averages in such datasets. 

So, the final list should include:
32, 36, 4, 70, 12",False

<task>
Which respondents have a total negative usability score ('System_Complexity' + 'Inconsistency' + 'Cumbersome_to_Use') that is higher than the average for their group?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the total negative usability score for each respondent, which is the sum of 'System_Complexity', 'Inconsistency', and 'Cumbersome_to_Use'. Then, we calculate the average of this score for each group. Finally, we identify the respondents whose total negative usability score is higher than the average for their group.

Let's calculate the total negative usability score for each respondent:

- Respondent 5: 1 (System_Complexity) + 1 (Inconsistency) + 1 (Cumbersome_to_Use) = 3

- Respondent 60: 1 + 2 + 1 = 4

- Respondent 77: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
- Respondent 64: 3 + 4 + 4 = 11
- Respondent 78: 1 + 4 + 2 = 7

Next, let's calculate the average total negative usability score for each group:

- Group A (Respondents 86, 13, 59): (13 + 3 + 3) / 3 = 19 / 3 = 6.33
- Group C (Respondents 5, 37, 19): (3 + 3 + 4) / 3 = 10 / 3 = 3.33
- Group D (Respondents 90, 60, 48, 77, 64, 78): (5 + 4 + 3 + 3 + 11 + 7) / 6 = 33 / 6 = 5.5

Now, let's identify the respondents whose total negative usability score is higher than the average for their group:

- Group A: Respondent 86 (13 > 6.33)
- Group C: Respondent 19 (4 > 3.33)
- Group D: Respondents 90 (5 > 5.5 is false), 60 (4 > 5.5 is false), 64 (11 > 5.5), 78 (7 > 5.5)

Therefore, the respondents with a total negative usability score higher than the average for their group are:

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents in the 'Junior' group whose 'Ease_of_Learning' is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Learning' for the 'Middle' group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Ease_of_Learning' for the 'Middle' group and then identify respondents in the 'Junior' group with an 'Ease_of_Learning' score higher than this average.

1. **Calculate the average 'Ease_of_Learning' for the 'Middle' group:**

Respondents in the 'Middle' group are those with Group = C. 

- Respondent 53: Group = C, Ease_of_Learning = 5
- Respondent 70: Group = C, Ease_of_Learning = 5

Average 'Ease_of_Learning' for 'Middle' group = (5 + 5) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5

2. **Identify respondents in the 'Junior' group:**

Respondents in the 'Junior' group are those with Group = B.

- Respondent 23: Group = B, Ease_of_Learning = 4

Since there's only one respondent in the 'Junior' group, and their 'Ease_of_Learning' score (4) is not higher than the average 'Ease_of_Learning' for the 'Middle' group (5), there are no respondents that meet the specified criteria.

Therefore, the list of respondents in the 'Junior' group whose 'Ease_of_Learning' is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Learning' for the 'Middle' group is empty.",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents in the 'Intern' group whose 'Confidence_in_Use' is higher than the average 'Confidence_in_Use' for the 'Junior' group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Confidence_in_Use' for the 'Junior' group and then identify all respondents in the 'Intern' group whose 'Confidence_in_Use' is higher than this average.

1. **Identify Respondents in the 'Junior' Group and Their 'Confidence_in_Use' Scores:**

From the responses, we find the following respondents in the 'Junior' group (Group B):
- Respondent 44: Confidence_in_Use = 1
- Respondent 3: Confidence_in_Use = 5

2. **Calculate the Average 'Confidence_in_Use' for the 'Junior' Group:**

Average Confidence_in_Use for Junior = (1 + 5) / 2 = 3

3. **Identify Respondents in the 'Intern' Group:**

From the responses, we find the following respondent in the 'Intern' group (Group D):
- Respondent 10: Confidence_in_Use = 5

4. **Determine Which 'Intern' Group Respondents Have 'Confidence_in_Use' Higher Than the Junior Group Average:**

Since Respondent 10's Confidence_in_Use (5) is higher than the average Confidence_in_Use for the 'Junior' group (3), Respondent 10 meets the criteria.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$",True
case_46,answer_reverse_lookup,Which respondents have a total negative usability score ('System_Complexity' + 'Inconsistency' + 'Cumbersome_to_Use') that is higher than the average for their group?,"Survey Data

<task>
Which respondents have a total negative usability score ('System_Complexity' + 'Inconsistency' + 'Cumbersome_to_Use') that is higher than the average for their group?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the total negative usability score for each respondent, which is the sum of 'System_Complexity', 'Inconsistency', and 'Cumbersome_to_Use'. Then, we calculate the average of this score for each group. Finally, we identify the respondents whose total negative usability score is higher than the average for their group.

### Step 1: Calculate Total Negative Usability Score for Each Respondent

We calculate the total negative usability score for each respondent by summing 'System_Complexity', 'Inconsistency', and 'Cumbersome_to_Use'.

- Respondent 10: 1 (System_Complexity) + 1 (Inconsistency) + 1 (Cumbersome_to_Use) = 3
- Respondent 52: 1 + 2 + 1 = 4
- Respondent 6: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
- Respondent 76: 1 + 2 + 2 = 5
- Respondent 30: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
- Respondent 82: 1 + 1 + 2 = 4
- Respondent 67: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
- Respondent 20: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3

### Step 2: Determine Group for Each Respondent

Based on the 'Group' field:
- Respondent 10: D (Intern)
- Respondent 52: A (Senior)
- Respondent 6: A (Senior)
- Respondent 76: A (Senior)
- Respondent 30: D (Intern)
- Respondent 82: C (Middle)
- Respondent 67: A (Senior)
- Respondent 20: C (Middle)

### Step 3: Calculate Average Total Negative Usability Score for Each Group

- Group A (Senior): (4 + 3 + 5 + 3) / 4 = 15 / 4 = 3.75
- Group C (Middle): (4 + 3) / 2 = 7 / 2 = 3.5
- Group D (Intern): (3 + 3) / 2 = 6 / 2 = 3

### Step 4: Identify Respondents with Score Higher Than Group Average

- Group A (Senior): Respondent 76 (score = 5) is higher than the group average (3.75).
- Group C (Middle): No respondents have a score higher than the group average (3.5).
- Group D (Intern): No respondents have a score higher than the group average (3).

The final answer is: $\boxed{76}$",False

<task>
Which respondents have a total negative usability score ('System_Complexity' + 'Inconsistency' + 'Cumbersome_to_Use') that is higher than the average for their group?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the total negative usability score for each respondent, which is the sum of 'System_Complexity', 'Inconsistency', and 'Cumbersome_to_Use'. Then, we calculate the average of this score for each group. Finally, we identify the respondents whose total negative usability score is higher than the average for their group.

Let's calculate the total negative usability score for each respondent:

1. Respondent 46: 1 (System_Complexity) + 2 (Inconsistency) + 1 (Cumbersome_to_Use) = 4
2. Respondent 9: 3 (System_Complexity) + 5 (Inconsistency) + 3 (Cumbersome_to_Use) = 11
3. Respondent 56: 2 (System_Complexity) + 1 (Inconsistency) + 1 (Cumbersome_to_Use) = 4
4. Respondent 71: 1 (System_Complexity) + 2 (Inconsistency) + 1 (Cumbersome_to_Use) = 4
5. Respondent 59: 1 (System_Complexity) + 1 (Inconsistency) + 1 (Cumbersome_to_Use) = 3
6. Respondent 74: 1 (System_Complexity) + 3 (Inconsistency) + 1 (Cumbersome_to_Use) = 5
7. Respondent 44: 2 (System_Complexity) + 1 (Inconsistency) + 1 (Cumbersome_to_Use) = 4
8. Respondent 33: 1 (System_Complexity) + 1 (Inconsistency) + 1 (Cumbersome_to_Use) = 3
9. Respondent 66: 1 (System_Complexity) + 2 (Inconsistency) + 1 (Cumbersome_to_Use) = 4
10. Respondent 50: 1 (System_Complexity) + 2 (Inconsistency) + 2 (Cumbersome_to_Use) = 5
11. Respondent 51: 1 (System_Complexity) + 1 (Inconsistency) + 1 (Cumbersome_to_Use) = 3
12. Respondent 79: 1 (System_Complexity) + 1 (Inconsistency) + 1 (Cumbersome_to_Use) = 3

Now, let's calculate the average total negative usability score for each group:

- Group A (Senior): (4 + 4 + 3 + 3) / 4 = 14 / 4 = 3.5
- Group B (Junior): (4 + 4 + 3) / 3 = 11 / 3 = 3.67
- Group C (Middle): (11 + 5 + 3 + 3) / 4 = 22 / 4 = 5.5
- Group D (Intern): (4 + 5) / 2 = 9 / 2 = 4.5

Now, we compare each respondent's score to their group's average:

1. Respondent 46 (Group A): 4 > 3.5
2. Respondent 9 (Group C): 11 > 5.5
3. Respondent 56 (Group A): 4 > 3.5

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents in the 'Junior' group whose 'Ease_of_Use' is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' for the 'Middle' group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Ease_of_Use' for the 'Middle' group and then identify respondents in the 'Junior' group with an 'Ease_of_Use' score higher than this average.

From the 'questions' section, we understand that 'Group' is a MCQ field with options A. Senior, B. Junior, C. Middle, D. Intern, and 'Ease_of_Use' is a Likert scale from 1 to 5.

Looking at the 'responses' section:

1. Respondent 17 is in the 'Middle' group (C) with an 'Ease_of_Use' score of 5.
2. Respondent 39 is in the 'Middle' group (C) with an 'Ease_of_Use' score of 1.

The average 'Ease_of_Use' for the 'Middle' group is (5 + 1) / 2 = 3.

Now, we look for respondents in the 'Junior' group (B) with an 'Ease_of_Use' score higher than 3:

1. Respondent 69 is in the 'Junior' group (B) with an 'Ease_of_Use' score of 5, which is higher than 3.

Therefore, the respondent in the 'Junior' group with an 'Ease_of_Use' higher than the average for the 'Middle' group is:

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents have a total negative usability score ('System_Complexity' + 'Inconsistency' + 'Cumbersome_to_Use') that is higher than the average for their group?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the total negative usability score for each respondent, which is the sum of 'System_Complexity', 'Inconsistency', and 'Cumbersome_to_Use'. Then, we calculate the average of this score for each group. Finally, we identify the respondents whose total negative usability score is higher than the average for their group.

### Step 1: Calculate Total Negative Usability Score for Each Respondent

We calculate the total negative usability score for each respondent by summing 'System_Complexity', 'Inconsistency', and 'Cumbersome_to_Use'.

- Respondent 9: 3 (System_Complexity) + 5 (Inconsistency) + 3 (Cumbersome_to_Use) = 11
- Respondent 45: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
- Respondent 53: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
- Respondent 15: 2 + 1 + 1 = 4
- Respondent 42: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
- Respondent 71: 1 + 2 + 1 = 4
- Respondent 66: 1 + 2 + 1 = 4
- Respondent 7: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
- Respondent 88: 2 + 3 + 2 = 7
- Respondent 6: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
- Respondent 36: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3

### Step 2: Calculate Average Total Negative Usability Score for Each Group

- Group A: (1 + 1) / 2 = 2 (Respondents 42 and 6)
- Group B: (4 + 3) / 2 = 3.5 (Respondents 66 and 36)
- Group C: (11 + 3 + 7) / 3 = 7 (Respondents 9, 53, and 88)
- Group D: (3 + 4 + 4 + 3) / 4 = 3.5 (Respondents 45, 15, 71, and 7)

### Step 3: Identify Respondents with Score Higher Than Group Average

- Group A: None (both scores are equal to the average)
- Group B: Respondent 66 (score of 4 is higher than the average of 3.5)
- Group C: Respondents 9 and 88 (scores of 11 and 7 are higher than the average of 7)
- Group D: None (all scores are equal to or lower than the average)

The final answer is: $\boxed{66, 9, 88}$",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondents have a total negative usability score ('System_Complexity' + 'Inconsistency' + 'Cumbersome_to_Use') that is higher than the average for their group?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the total negative usability score for each respondent, which is the sum of 'System_Complexity', 'Inconsistency', and 'Cumbersome_to_Use'. Then, we calculate the average of this score for each group. Finally, we identify the respondents whose total negative usability score is higher than the average for their group.

Let's calculate the total negative usability score for each respondent:

- Respondent 64: 3 (System_Complexity) + 4 (Inconsistency) + 4 (Cumbersome_to_Use) = 11
- Respondent 35: 5 + 5 + 5 = 15
- Respondent 47: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
- Respondent 82: 1 + 1 + 2 = 4
- Respondent 32: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
- Respondent 89: 2 + 3 + 1 = 6
- Respondent 61: 5 + 4 + 5 = 14
- Respondent 43: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
- Respondent 11: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3

Now, let's group the respondents by their group and calculate the average total negative usability score for each group:

- Group A (Senior): Respondents 35, 89, 11. Scores: 15, 6, 3. Average = (15 + 6 + 3) / 3 = 24 / 3 = 8
- Group B (Junior): Respondents 47, 32, 61. Scores: 3, 3, 14. Average = (3 + 3 + 14) / 3 = 20 / 3 = 6.67
- Group C (Middle): Respondents 82, 43. Scores: 4, 3. Average = (4 + 3) / 2 = 7 / 2 = 3.5
- Group D (Intern): Respondent 64. Score: 11. Average = 11 (since there's only one respondent in this group)

Now, let's identify the respondents whose total negative usability score is higher than the average for their group:

- Group A: Respondent 35 (score 15) is higher than the average (8).
- Group B: Respondent 61 (score 14) is higher than the average (6.67).
- Group C: None of the respondents have a score higher than the average (3.5).
- Group D: Since there's only one respondent, there's no average to compare against in the traditional sense, but we can note Respondent 64's score is the average for their group.

Therefore, the respondents with a total negative usability score higher than the average for their group are:

35, 61",False
