</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents are in the 'Junior' group?
</task>","To determine which respondents are in the 'Junior' group, we need to look at the 'Group' question in the schema, which is defined as ""[MCQ: A. Senior B. Junior C. Middle D. Intern]"". This means that the letter code 'B' corresponds to 'Junior'.

Looking at the responses, we find the following respondents with 'B' as their answer to the 'Group' question:

- Respondent id=""47"" with answer ""B""
- Respondent id=""61"" with answer ""B""

Therefore, the respondents in the 'Junior' group are 47, 61.",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents who rated 'Frequent_Usage' as 4.
</task>","To find all respondents who rated 'Frequent_Usage' as 4, we need to look at the 'responses' section of the data and identify the respondent IDs where the answer to the 'Frequent_Usage' question is 4.

From the provided data, the respondents with 'Frequent_Usage' rated as 4 are:

- Respondent id=""67""
- Respondent id=""66""

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents who rated 'Inconsistency' and 'Integration_of_Functions' with the same score.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to examine each respondent's answers for the 'Inconsistency' and 'Integration_of_Functions' questions and identify those where the scores match.

From the provided data:

1. Respondent 26: 'Inconsistency' = 2, 'Integration_of_Functions' = 4 (do not match)
2. Respondent 85: 'Inconsistency' = 2, 'Integration_of_Functions' = 5 (do not match)
3. Respondent 27: 'Inconsistency' = 4, 'Integration_of_Functions' = 2 (do not match)
4. Respondent 56: 'Inconsistency' = 1, 'Integration_of_Functions' = 5 (do not match)
5. Respondent 77: 'Inconsistency' = 1, 'Integration_of_Functions' = 4 (do not match)

None of the respondents have the same score for 'Inconsistency' and 'Integration_of_Functions'.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondents from the 'Junior' group rated 'Frequent_Usage' as 4 and 'Confidence_in_Use' as 2?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to analyze the 'responses' section of the provided dataset and identify respondents who belong to the 'Junior' group, rated 'Frequent_Usage' as 4, and rated 'Confidence_in_Use' as 2.

According to the 'questions' schema, the 'Group' question is a multiple-choice question with options A. Senior, B. Junior, C. Middle, and D. Intern. Therefore, respondents from the 'Junior' group will have answered ""B"" to the 'Group' question.

Upon examining the 'responses' section, we find one respondent who matches the specified criteria:

- Respondent id ""23"" answered ""B"" to the 'Group' question, indicating they are from the 'Junior' group.
- They rated 'Frequent_Usage' as 4.
- They rated 'Confidence_in_Use' as 2.

Therefore, the respondent from the 'Junior' group who rated 'Frequent_Usage' as 4 and 'Confidence_in_Use' as 2 is:

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose combined score for 'Cumbersome_to_Use' and 'Frequent_Usage' is less than 6.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to iterate through each respondent's answers in the 'responses' section and check their scores for 'Cumbersome_to_Use' and 'Frequent_Usage'. We then combine these scores and check if the sum is less than 6. If it is, we note the respondent's ID.

Given the provided data:

- Respondent 70: 'Cumbersome_to_Use' = 1, 'Frequent_Usage' = 5, Combined score = 6
- Respondent 38: 'Cumbersome_to_Use' = 1, 'Frequent_Usage' = 3, Combined score = 4
- Respondent 79: 'Cumbersome_to_Use' = 1, 'Frequent_Usage' = 5, Combined score = 6
- Respondent 4: 'Cumbersome_to_Use' = 1, 'Frequent_Usage' = 4, Combined score = 5
- Respondent 80: 'Cumbersome_to_Use' = 1, 'Frequent_Usage' = 5, Combined score = 6

From the calculations, the respondents with a combined score less than 6 are:

- Respondent 38 (score = 4)
- Respondent 4 (score = 5)

Therefore, the IDs of the respondents whose combined score for 'Cumbersome_to_Use' and 'Frequent_Usage' is less than 6 are 38, 4.",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Find all respondents whose combined score for 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' and 'System_Complexity' is less than 3.
</task>","To find all respondents whose combined score for 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' and 'System_Complexity' is less than 3, we need to examine each respondent's answers for these two questions and sum them up.

From the provided data:

1. Respondent 10: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 2, 'System_Complexity' = 1. Combined score = 3.
2. Respondent 28: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 4, 'System_Complexity' = 1. Combined score = 5.
3. Respondent 19: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 2, 'System_Complexity' = 1. Combined score = 3.
4. Respondent 39: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 4, 'System_Complexity' = 4. Combined score = 8.
5. Respondent 90: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 1, 'System_Complexity' = 1. Combined score = 2.
6. Respondent 31: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 1, 'System_Complexity' = 1. Combined score = 2.
7. Respondent 64: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 5, 'System_Complexity' = 3. Combined score = 8.
8. Respondent 4: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 1, 'System_Complexity' = 1. Combined score = 2.
9. Respondent 5: 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' = 1, 'System_Complexity' = 1. Combined score = 2.

The respondents with a combined score less than 3 are:
- Respondent 90
- Respondent 31
- Respondent 4
- Respondent 5

Therefore, the list of respondent IDs whose combined score for 'Need_to_Learn_Before_Use' and 'System_Complexity' is less than 3 is: 90, 31, 4, 5.",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents who rated 'Confidence_in_Use' and 'Frequent_Usage' with the same score.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to iterate through each respondent's answers and check if the scores for 'Confidence_in_Use' and 'Frequent_Usage' are the same.

After analyzing the data, the respondents who rated 'Confidence_in_Use' and 'Frequent_Usage' with the same score are: 74, 81, 30, 36, 62, 84, 69 

However, upon closer inspection, we can see that not all of these respondents actually rated 'Confidence_in_Use' and 'Frequent_Usage' with the same score.

Respondent 74: 'Frequent_Usage' = 5, 'Confidence_in_Use' = 5 (match)
Respondent 81: 'Frequent_Usage' = 1, 'Confidence_in_Use' = 4 (no match)
Respondent 30: 'Frequent_Usage' = 3, 'Confidence_in_Use' = 5 (no match)
Respondent 36: 'Frequent_Usage' = 1, 'Confidence_in_Use' = 4 (no match)
Respondent 62: 'Frequent_Usage' = 1, 'Confidence_in_Use' = 5 (no match)
Respondent 84: 'Frequent_Usage' = 3, 'Confidence_in_Use' = 5 (no match)
Respondent 69: 'Frequent_Usage' = 3, 'Confidence_in_Use' = 4 (no match)
Respondent 22: 'Frequent_Usage' = 1, 'Confidence_in_Use' = 4 (no match)

Only respondent 74 has the same score for 'Confidence_in_Use' and 'Frequent_Usage'.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</task>","To find all respondents whose combined score for 'Integration_of_Functions' and 'Need_for_Technical_Support' is less than 6, we need to go through each respondent's answers in the 'responses' section and check their scores for these two questions.

1. Respondent 43: Integration_of_Functions = 5, Need_for_Technical_Support = 1, Combined = 6 (not less than 6)
2. Respondent 8: Integration_of_Functions = 5, Need_for_Technical_Support = 1, Combined = 6 (not less than 6)
3. Respondent 3: Integration_of_Functions = 2, Need_for_Technical_Support = 1, Combined = 3 (less than 6)
4. Respondent 37: Integration_of_Functions = 5, Need_for_Technical_Support = 2, Combined = 7 (not less than 6)
5. Respondent 11: Integration_of_Functions = 5, Need_for_Technical_Support = 5, Combined = 10 (not less than 6)
6. Respondent 1: Integration_of_Functions = 5, Need_for_Technical_Support = 1, Combined = 6 (not less than 6)
7. Respondent 65: Integration_of_Functions = 2, Need_for_Technical_Support = 5, Combined = 7 (not less than 6)

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents from the 'Middle' group rated 'Inconsistency' as 3 and 'Cumbersome_to_Use' as 1?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to analyze the 'responses' section of the provided data and identify respondents who belong to the 'Middle' group, rated 'Inconsistency' as 3, and rated 'Cumbersome_to_Use' as 1.

From the 'questions' section, we understand that the 'Group' question is a multiple-choice question with options A. Senior, B. Junior, C. Middle, and D. Intern. The 'Inconsistency' and 'Cumbersome_to_Use' questions are Likert scale questions with scores ranging from 1 to 5.

Analyzing the 'responses' section:

- Respondent 88 belongs to group C (Middle), rated 'Inconsistency' as 3, and 'Cumbersome_to_Use' as 2. This respondent does not meet the criteria because their 'Cumbersome_to_Use' rating is not 1.
- Respondent 82 belongs to group C (Middle), rated 'Inconsistency' as 1, and 'Cumbersome_to_Use' as 2. This respondent does not meet the criteria because their 'Inconsistency' rating is not 3.
- Respondent 5 belongs to group C (Middle), rated 'Inconsistency' as 1, and 'Cumbersome_to_Use' as 1. This respondent does not meet the criteria because their 'Inconsistency' rating is not 3.

None of the respondents from the 'Middle' group rated 'Inconsistency' as 3 and 'Cumbersome_to_Use' as 1. Therefore, there are no respondents that meet the specified criteria.

Since no respondents match the given conditions, the answer is simply that there are no such respondents. However, following the format strictly and the nature of the question asking for a list of IDs, the appropriate response would reflect the absence of matching respondents.",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents who rated 'Integration_of_Functions' and 'Inconsistency' with the same score.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to iterate through each respondent's answers in the 'responses' section and compare their scores for 'Integration_of_Functions' and 'Inconsistency'. We are looking for respondents where these two scores are the same.

Given the provided data, let's examine each respondent:

1. Respondent 27: 'Integration_of_Functions' = 2, 'Inconsistency' = 4. These scores are not the same.
2. Respondent 34: 'Integration_of_Functions' = 4, 'Inconsistency' = 1. These scores are not the same.
3. Respondent 50: 'Integration_of_Functions' = 5, 'Inconsistency' = 2. These scores are not the same.
4. Respondent 4: 'Integration_of_Functions' = 3, 'Inconsistency' = 1. These scores are not the same.
5. Respondent 25: 'Integration_of_Functions' = 3, 'Inconsistency' = 4. These scores are not the same.
6. Respondent 29: 'Integration_of_Functions' = 4, 'Inconsistency' = 1. These scores are not the same.
7. Respondent 51: 'Integration_of_Functions' = 5, 'Inconsistency' = 1. These scores are not the same.
8. Respondent 73: 'Integration_of_Functions' = 4, 'Inconsistency' = 1. These scores are not the same.
9. Respondent 1: 'Integration_of_Functions' = 5, 'Inconsistency' = 1. These scores are not the same.

Upon reviewing the data, there are no respondents who rated 'Integration_of_Functions' and 'Inconsistency' with the same score. 

The final answer is: $\boxed{None}$",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'Inconsistency' score is higher than the average 'Inconsistency' score for their group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Inconsistency' score for each group and then identify the respondents whose 'Inconsistency' score is higher than the average for their respective group.

Given the data, let's calculate the average 'Inconsistency' score for each group:

1. **Group A**: Only respondent 89 belongs to this group, with an 'Inconsistency' score of 3. Thus, the average for Group A is 3.
2. **Group B**: Respondent 36 belongs to this group, with an 'Inconsistency' score of 1. Thus, the average for Group B is 1.
3. **Group C**: Respondents 43, 22, 50, and 37 belong to this group. Their 'Inconsistency' scores are 1, 5, 2, and 1, respectively. The sum of these scores is 1 + 5 + 2 + 1 = 9, and there are 4 respondents. Thus, the average for Group C is 9 / 4 = 2.25.
4. **Group D**: Respondents 49, 30, 74, and 71 belong to this group. Their 'Inconsistency' scores are 4, 1, 3, and 2, respectively. The sum of these scores is 4 + 1 + 3 + 2 = 10, and there are 4 respondents. Thus, the average for Group D is 10 / 4 = 2.5.

Now, let's identify the respondents whose 'Inconsistency' score is higher than the average for their group:

- **Group A**: Since the average is 3, and respondent 89 has a score of 3, there are no respondents with a score higher than the average.
- **Group B**: The average is 1, and respondent 36 has a score of 1. There are no respondents with a score higher than the average.
- **Group C**: The average is 2.25. Respondent 22 has a score of 5, which is higher than the average.
- **Group D**: The average is 2.5. Respondent 49 has a score of 4, which is higher than the average.

Therefore, the respondents whose 'Inconsistency' score is higher than the average for their group are:

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'Ease_of_Use' score is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' score for their group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Ease_of_Use' score for each group and then identify the respondents whose 'Ease_of_Use' score is higher than the average for their respective group.

1. **Calculate the average 'Ease_of_Use' score for each group:**

From the 'questions' section, we understand that 'Group' is a MCQ with options A. Senior, B. Junior, C. Middle, D. Intern, and 'Ease_of_Use' is a Likert scale from 1 to 5.

Let's calculate the average 'Ease_of_Use' score for each group based on the 'responses' section:

- **Group A (Senior):** There are no respondents in this group.
- **Group B (Junior):**
  - Respondent 36: Ease_of_Use = 5
  - Respondent 32: Ease_of_Use = 5
  - Respondent 14: Ease_of_Use = 4
  Average for Group B = (5 + 5 + 4) / 3 = 14 / 3 = 4.67
- **Group C (Middle):**
  - Respondent 82: Ease_of_Use = 4
  - Respondent 4: Ease_of_Use = 5
  - Respondent 87: Ease_of_Use = 3
  - Respondent 70: Ease_of_Use = 5
  Average for Group C = (4 + 5 + 3 + 5) / 4 = 17 / 4 = 4.25
- **Group D (Intern):**
  - Respondent 15: Ease_of_Use = 4
  - Respondent 29: Ease_of_Use = 4
  - Respondent 18: Ease_of_Use = 4
  - Respondent 12: Ease_of_Use = 5
  Average for Group D = (4 + 4 + 4 + 5) / 4 = 17 / 4 = 4.25

2. **Identify respondents whose 'Ease_of_Use' score is higher than the average for their group:**

- **Group B (Junior):** Average = 4.67
  - Respondent 36: Ease_of_Use = 5 (Higher)
  - Respondent 32: Ease_of_Use = 5 (Higher)
  - Respondent 14: Ease_of_Use = 4 (Not Higher)
- **Group C (Middle):** Average = 4.25
  - Respondent 82: Ease_of_Use = 4 (Not Higher)
  - Respondent 4: Ease_of_Use = 5 (Higher)
  - Respondent 87: Ease_of_Use = 3 (Not Higher)
  - Respondent 70: Ease_of_Use = 5 (Higher)
- **Group D (Intern):** Average = 4.25
  - Respondent 15: Ease_of_Use = 4 (Not Higher)
  - Respondent 29: Ease_of_Use = 4 (Not Higher)
  - Respondent 18: Ease_of_Use = 4 (Not Higher)
  - Respondent 12: Ease_of_Use = 5 (Higher)

**Respondents with 'Ease_of_Use' score higher than the average for their group:**

- Respondent 36 (Group B)
- Respondent 32 (Group B)
- Respondent 4 (Group C)
- Respondent 70 (Group C)
- Respondent 12 (Group D)

**IDs of these respondents:** 36, 32, 4, 70, 12",False
case_43,answer_reverse_lookup,Which respondents have a total negative usability score ('System_Complexity' + 'Inconsistency' + 'Cumbersome_to_Use') that is higher than the average for their group?,"<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondents have a total negative usability score ('System_Complexity' + 'Inconsistency' + 'Cumbersome_to_Use') that is higher than the average for their group?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the total negative usability score for each respondent, which is the sum of their scores for 'System_Complexity', 'Inconsistency', and 'Cumbersome_to_Use'. Then, we need to calculate the average total negative usability score for each group. Finally, we compare each respondent's score to their group's average to find those with a higher score.

### Step 1: Calculate Total Negative Usability Score for Each Respondent

We calculate the total negative usability score for each respondent by summing their 'System_Complexity', 'Inconsistency', and 'Cumbersome_to_Use' scores.

### Step 2: Calculate Average Total Negative Usability Score for Each Group

We group respondents by their 'Group' and calculate the average total negative usability score for each group.

### Step 3: Identify Respondents with Higher Scores Than Their Group's Average

We compare each respondent's total negative usability score to their group's average score and identify those with a higher score.

Given the complexity and the need for precise calculations based on the provided data, let's proceed with the analysis:

1. **Calculate Total Negative Usability Scores:**

Respondent 5: 1 (System_Complexity) + 1 (Inconsistency) + 1 (Cumbersome_to_Use) = 3  
Respondent 37: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3  
Respondent 90: 1 + 2 + 2 = 5  
Respondent 19: 1 + 1 + 2 = 4  
Respondent 60: 1 + 2 + 1 = 4  
Respondent 48: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3  
Respondent 86: 5 + 3 + 5 = 13  
Respondent 13: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3  
Respondent 59: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3  
Respondent 77: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3  
Respondent 64: 3 + 4 + 4 = 11  
Respondent 78: 1 + 4 + 2 = 7  

2. **Group Respondents and Calculate Group Averages:**

- **Group A (Senior):** Respondents 86, 13, 59  
  - Total Scores: 13 (86) + 3 (13) + 3 (59) = 19  
  - Average: 19 / 3 = 6.33  
- **Group C (Middle):** Respondents 5, 37, 19  
  - Total Scores: 3 (5) + 3 (37) + 4 (19) = 10  
  - Average: 10 / 3 = 3.33  
- **Group D (Intern):** Respondents 90, 60, 48, 77, 64, 78  
  - Total Scores: 5 (90) + 4 (60) + 3 (48) + 3 (77) + 11 (64) + 7 (78) = 33  
  - Average: 33 / 6 = 5.5  

3. **Identify Respondents with Scores Higher Than Their Group's Average:**

- **Group A:** Respondent 86 (13 > 6.33)  
- **Group C:** Respondent 19 (4 > 3.33)  
- **Group D:** Respondents 90 (5 > 5.5), 64 (11 > 5.5), 78 (7 > 5.5)  

Thus, the respondents with a total negative usability score higher than the average for their group are:

86, 19, 90, 64, 78

These respondents have scores that exceed the average total negative usability score for their respective groups.",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents in the 'Junior' group whose 'Ease_of_Learning' is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Learning' for the 'Middle' group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Ease_of_Learning' for the 'Middle' group and then find all respondents in the 'Junior' group whose 'Ease_of_Learning' score is higher than this average.

1. **Identify 'Middle' group respondents and their 'Ease_of_Learning' scores:**
   - Respondent 53: 'Middle' group, 'Ease_of_Learning' = 5
   - Respondent 67: Not in 'Middle' group
   - Respondent 70: 'Middle' group, 'Ease_of_Learning' = 5
   - Respondent 90: Not in 'Middle' group
   - Respondent 15: Not in 'Middle' group
   - Respondent 23: Not in 'Middle' group, but in 'Junior' group
   - Respondent 49: Not in 'Middle' group
   - Respondent 29: Not in 'Middle' group

2. **Calculate the average 'Ease_of_Learning' for the 'Middle' group:**
   - Average = (5 + 5) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5

3. **Identify 'Junior' group respondents and their 'Ease_of_Learning' scores:**
   - Respondent 23: 'Junior' group, 'Ease_of_Learning' = 4

4. **Find 'Junior' group respondents with 'Ease_of_Learning' higher than the 'Middle' group average:**
   - Since the average 'Ease_of_Learning' for the 'Middle' group is 5, and the only 'Junior' group respondent has a score of 4, there are no respondents in the 'Junior' group whose 'Ease_of_Learning' is higher than the average for the 'Middle' group.

Therefore, the list of respondents is empty.",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents in the 'Intern' group whose 'Confidence_in_Use' is higher than the average 'Confidence_in_Use' for the 'Junior' group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Confidence_in_Use' for the 'Junior' group. Then, we will identify all respondents in the 'Intern' group and check if their 'Confidence_in_Use' is higher than this average.

1. **Calculate the average 'Confidence_in_Use' for the 'Junior' group:**

From the data, the respondents in the 'Junior' group (B) are:
- Respondent 44 with 'Confidence_in_Use' = 1
- Respondent 3 with 'Confidence_in_Use' = 5

Average 'Confidence_in_Use' for 'Junior' = (1 + 5) / 2 = 3

2. **Identify respondents in the 'Intern' group (D) with 'Confidence_in_Use' higher than the average for 'Junior':**

The respondent in the 'Intern' group is:
- Respondent 10 with 'Confidence_in_Use' = 5

Since 5 is higher than 3, respondent 10 meets the criteria.

Therefore, the respondent in the 'Intern' group whose 'Confidence_in_Use' is higher than the average 'Confidence_in_Use' for the 'Junior' group is:

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondents have a total negative usability score ('System_Complexity' + 'Inconsistency' + 'Cumbersome_to_Use') that is higher than the average for their group?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the total negative usability score for each respondent, which is the sum of their scores for 'System_Complexity', 'Inconsistency', and 'Cumbersome_to_Use'. Then, we need to calculate the average total negative usability score for each group. Finally, we compare each respondent's score to the average score of their group to find those with a higher total negative usability score.

Given the data, let's calculate:

1. Total negative usability score for each respondent.
2. Average total negative usability score for each group.
3. Identify respondents with a score higher than their group's average.

### Step 1: Calculate Total Negative Usability Score for Each Respondent

### Step 2: Calculate Average Total Negative Usability Score for Each Group

- Group A: (4 + 3 + 5 + 3) / 4 = 15 / 4 = 3.75
- Group C: (4 + 3) / 2 = 7 / 2 = 3.5
- Group D: (3 + 3) / 2 = 6 / 2 = 3

### Step 3: Identify Respondents with a Score Higher Than Their Group's Average

- Group A: 52 (score 4), 76 (score 5) have scores higher than the group average (3.75).
- Group C: 82 (score 4) has a score higher than the group average (3.5).
- Group D: None have a score higher than the group average (3).

Therefore, the respondents with a total negative usability score higher than the average for their group are 52, 76, and 82.",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondents have a total negative usability score ('System_Complexity' + 'Inconsistency' + 'Cumbersome_to_Use') that is higher than the average for their group?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the total negative usability score for each respondent, which is the sum of their scores for 'System_Complexity', 'Inconsistency', and 'Cumbersome_to_Use'. Then, we need to calculate the average of this score for each group. Finally, we identify the respondents whose total negative usability score is higher than the average for their group.

Here are the steps with calculations:

1. **Calculate Total Negative Usability Score for Each Respondent:**

   - For each respondent, add the scores of 'System_Complexity', 'Inconsistency', and 'Cumbersome_to_Use'.

2. **Calculate Average Total Negative Usability Score for Each Group:**

   - Group the respondents by their 'Group' answer (A, B, C, D).
   - For each group, calculate the average total negative usability score.

3. **Identify Respondents with Scores Higher than Group Average:**

   - Compare each respondent's total negative usability score with the average score of their group.
   - List the IDs of respondents whose score is higher than their group's average.

Let's perform these steps with the provided data:

### Step 1: Calculate Total Negative Usability Score for Each Respondent

| Respondent ID | Group | System_Complexity | Inconsistency | Cumbersome_to_Use | Total Negative Usability Score |
|---------------|-------|-------------------|---------------|-------------------|-------------------------------|
| 46            | A     | 1                 | 2             | 1                 | 4                             |
| 9             | C     | 3                 | 5             | 3                 | 11                            |
| 56            | A     | 2                 | 1             | 1                 | 4                             |
| 71            | D     | 1                 | 2             | 1                 | 4                             |
| 59            | A     | 1                 | 1             | 1                 | 3                             |
| 74            | D     | 1                 | 3             | 1                 | 5                             |
| 44            | B     | 2                 | 1             | 1                 | 4                             |
| 33            | C     | 1                 | 1             | 1                 | 3                             |
| 66            | B     | 1                 | 2             | 1                 | 4                             |
| 50            | C     | 1                 | 2             | 2                 | 5                             |
| 51            | C     | 1                 | 1             | 1                 | 3                             |
| 79            | B     | 1                 | 1             | 1                 | 3                             |

### Step 2: Calculate Average Total Negative Usability Score for Each Group

- **Group A (Senior):** (4 + 4 + 3) / 3 = 11 / 3 = 3.67
- **Group B (Junior):** (4 + 4 + 3) / 3 = 11 / 3 = 3.67
- **Group C (Middle):** (11 + 3 + 5 + 3) / 4 = 22 / 4 = 5.5
- **Group D (Intern):** (4 + 5) / 2 = 9 / 2 = 4.5

### Step 3: Identify Respondents with Scores Higher than Group Average

- **Group A:** None (all scores are less than or equal to 3.67)
- **Group B:** None (all scores are less than or equal to 3.67)
- **Group C:** 9 (score of 11 is higher than 5.5)
- **Group D:** 74 (score of 5 is higher than 4.5)

Therefore, the respondents with a total negative usability score higher than the average for their group are:

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents in the 'Junior' group whose 'Ease_of_Use' is higher than the average 'Ease_of_Use' for the 'Middle' group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Ease_of_Use' for the 'Middle' group and then identify all respondents in the 'Junior' group whose 'Ease_of_Use' score is higher than this average.

1. **Identify 'Middle' group respondents and their 'Ease_of_Use' scores:**
   - Respondent 17: 'Middle', 'Ease_of_Use' = 5
   - Respondent 39: 'Middle', 'Ease_of_Use' = 1

2. **Calculate the average 'Ease_of_Use' for the 'Middle' group:**
   - Average = (5 + 1) / 2 = 3

3. **Identify 'Junior' group respondents and their 'Ease_of_Use' scores:**
   - Respondent 69: 'Junior', 'Ease_of_Use' = 5

4. **Find 'Junior' group respondents with 'Ease_of_Use' higher than the 'Middle' group average (3):**
   - Respondent 69: 'Ease_of_Use' = 5, which is higher than 3.

Therefore, the respondent in the 'Junior' group with an 'Ease_of_Use' score higher than the average for the 'Middle' group is:

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondents have a total negative usability score ('System_Complexity' + 'Inconsistency' + 'Cumbersome_to_Use') that is higher than the average for their group?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the total negative usability score for each respondent, which is the sum of their scores for 'System_Complexity', 'Inconsistency', and 'Cumbersome_to_Use'. Then, we need to calculate the average total negative usability score for each group. Finally, we compare each respondent's score to the average score for their group to identify those with a higher total negative usability score.

Here are the steps and calculations:

1. **Calculate Total Negative Usability Score for Each Respondent:**

   - For each respondent, add the scores of 'System_Complexity', 'Inconsistency', and 'Cumbersome_to_Use'.

2. **Calculate Average Total Negative Usability Score for Each Group:**

   - Group the respondents by their 'Group' answer (A. Senior, B. Junior, C. Middle, D. Intern).
   - For each group, calculate the average total negative usability score.

3. **Identify Respondents with a Higher Score than Their Group's Average:**

   - Compare each respondent's total negative usability score to the average score of their group.
   - List the IDs of respondents whose score is higher than their group's average.

Let's perform these calculations based on the provided data:

### Step 1: Calculate Total Negative Usability Score for Each Respondent

| Respondent ID | Group | System_Complexity | Inconsistency | Cumbersome_to_Use | Total Negative Usability Score |
|---------------|-------|-------------------|---------------|-------------------|--------------------------------|
| 9             | C     | 3                 | 5             | 3                 | 11                            |
| 45            | D     | 1                 | 1             | 1                 | 3                             |
| 53            | C     | 1                 | 1             | 1                 | 3                             |
| 15            | D     | 2                 | 1             | 1                 | 4                             |
| 42            | A     | 1                 | 1             | 1                 | 3                             |
| 71            | D     | 1                 | 2             | 1                 | 4                             |
| 66            | B     | 1                 | 2             | 1                 | 4                             |
| 7             | D     | 1                 | 1             | 1                 | 3                             |
| 88            | C     | 2                 | 3             | 2                 | 7                             |
| 6             | A     | 1                 | 1             | 1                 | 3                             |
| 36            | B     | 1                 | 1             | 1                 | 3                             |

### Step 2: Calculate Average Total Negative Usability Score for Each Group

- **Group A (Senior):** (3 + 3) / 2 = 3
- **Group B (Junior):** (4 + 3) / 2 = 3.5
- **Group C (Middle):** (11 + 3 + 7) / 3 = 7
- **Group D (Intern):** (3 + 4 + 4 + 3) / 4 = 3.5

### Step 3: Identify Respondents with a Higher Score than Their Group's Average

- **Group A:** None (both have a score of 3, which is the average)
- **Group B:** Respondent 66 (score of 4, which is higher than 3.5)
- **Group C:** Respondents 9 and 88 (scores of 11 and 7, respectively, which are higher than 7; however, since 7 is the average and 7 is not higher than 7, only respondent 9 is actually higher than the group average)
- **Group D:** None (all have scores of 3 or 4, with 3.5 being the average; thus, none are higher than the average)

Therefore, the respondents with a total negative usability score higher than the average for their group are:

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondents have a total negative usability score ('System_Complexity' + 'Inconsistency' + 'Cumbersome_to_Use') that is higher than the average for their group?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the total negative usability score for each respondent, which is the sum of their scores for 'System_Complexity', 'Inconsistency', and 'Cumbersome_to_Use'. Then, we need to calculate the average total negative usability score for each group. Finally, we compare each respondent's score to their group's average to find those with a higher score.

Here are the steps and calculations:

1. **Calculate Total Negative Usability Score for Each Respondent:**

   - Respondent 64: 3 (System_Complexity) + 4 (Inconsistency) + 4 (Cumbersome_to_Use) = 11
   - Respondent 35: 5 + 5 + 5 = 15
   - Respondent 47: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
   - Respondent 82: 1 + 1 + 2 = 4
   - Respondent 32: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
   - Respondent 89: 2 + 3 + 1 = 6
   - Respondent 61: 5 + 4 + 5 = 14
   - Respondent 43: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
   - Respondent 11: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3

2. **Determine Group for Each Respondent:**

   - Respondent 64: D (Intern)
   - Respondent 35: A (Senior)
   - Respondent 47: B (Junior)
   - Respondent 82: C (Middle)
   - Respondent 32: B (Junior)
   - Respondent 89: A (Senior)
   - Respondent 61: B (Junior)
   - Respondent 43: C (Middle)
   - Respondent 11: A (Senior)

3. **Calculate Average Total Negative Usability Score for Each Group:**

   - Group A (Senior): (15 + 6 + 3) / 3 = 24 / 3 = 8
   - Group B (Junior): (3 + 3 + 14) / 3 = 20 / 3 = 6.67
   - Group C (Middle): (4 + 3) / 2 = 7 / 2 = 3.5
   - Group D (Intern): 11 / 1 = 11

4. **Identify Respondents with a Score Higher Than Their Group's Average:**

   - Group A (Senior): Respondent 35 (15) and Respondent 89 (6) have scores higher and lower than the average, respectively. Respondent 11 (3) has a score lower than the average.
   - Group B (Junior): Respondent 61 (14) has a score higher than the average. Respondents 47 (3) and 32 (3) have scores lower than the average.
   - Group C (Middle): Respondent 82 (4) has a score higher than the average. Respondent 43 (3) has a score lower than the average.
   - Group D (Intern): Since there's only one respondent in this group, Respondent 64 (11) is the average, so there are no respondents with a score higher than the average in this context.

**Respondents with a Total Negative Usability Score Higher Than Their Group's Average:**

- Respondent 35 (Senior)
- Respondent 61 (Junior)
- Respondent 82 (Middle)

Therefore, the IDs of the respondents who have a total negative usability score higher than the average for their group are: 35, 61, 82.",False
