<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents with the same gender as respondent '90', excluding the respondent themselves.
</task>","To find all respondents with the same gender as respondent '90', we first need to determine the gender of respondent '90'. According to the data, respondent '90' has a ""Gender"" of 1.0. Referring to the ""questions"" section, the ""Gender"" question is defined as ""[MCQ: 1. Male 2. Female]"". Therefore, respondent '90' is male.

Now, we need to find all other respondents who are also male (Gender = 1.0), excluding respondent '90' themselves. 

Respondents with Gender = 1.0 are: 
- ""112""
- ""57""
- ""116""
- ""7""

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents who have the same 'Socio-economic status' as respondent '96'.
</task>","To find the respondents with the same 'Socio-economic status' as respondent '96', we first need to determine the 'Socio-economic status' of respondent '96'. According to the data, respondent '96' has a 'Socio-economic status' of 4.0.

Now, we will go through the responses to find all respondents who also have a 'Socio-economic status' of 4.0.

After reviewing the data, we find that only respondent '96' has a 'Socio-economic status' of 4.0. There are no other respondents with the same 'Socio-economic status'.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
List all respondents who have the same 'Socio-economic status' as respondent '86'.
</task>","To find the respondents with the same 'Socio-economic status' as respondent '86', we first need to determine the 'Socio-economic status' of respondent '86'. According to the data, respondent '86' has a 'Socio-economic status' of 1.0.

Now, we will go through the responses to find all respondents who also have a 'Socio-economic status' of 1.0.

Respondents '58' and '8' also have a 'Socio-economic status' of 1.0.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Find all respondents with the same gender as respondent '108', excluding the respondent themselves.
</task>","To find all respondents with the same gender as respondent '108', we first need to determine the gender of respondent '108'. According to the data, respondent '108' has a ""Gender"" of 2.0. Referring to the 'questions' section, the ""Gender"" field is defined as ""[MCQ: 1. Male 2. Female]"". Therefore, respondent '108' is female.

Now, we need to find all other respondents who are also female, excluding respondent '108' themselves. We look for respondents with a ""Gender"" of 2.0.

Respondents with the same gender as respondent '108' (female), excluding respondent '108', are: 61 is male, 74 is male, 78 is female, 32 is male, 13 is male, 62 is female, 118 is female, 17 is female, 128 is male, 29 is male. 

So, the female respondents, excluding '108', are 78, 62, 118, 17.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents with the same gender as respondent '132', excluding the respondent themselves.
</task>","To find all respondents with the same gender as respondent '132', we first need to determine the gender of respondent '132'. According to the data, respondent '132' has a ""Gender"" of 2.0. Referring to the ""questions"" section, the ""Gender"" field is defined as ""[MCQ: 1. Male 2. Female]"". Therefore, respondent '132' is female.

Now, we need to find all other respondents who are also female (Gender = 2.0), excluding respondent '132' themselves. 

Looking through the responses:
- Respondent '148' is male (Gender = 1.0).
- Respondent '62' is female (Gender = 2.0).
- Respondent '37' is female (Gender = 2.0).
- Respondent '75' is male (Gender = 1.0).

So, the female respondents, excluding '132', are '62' and '37'.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondents were born in the same year as respondent '107'?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to find the year of birth of respondent '107' and then identify other respondents who were born in the same year.

According to the 'responses' section, respondent '107' was born in 2001.0. Now, we need to find other respondents who were also born in 2001.0.

After reviewing the 'responses' section, we found the following respondents who were born in 2001.0:

* Respondent '18'
* Respondent '48' was born in 1999.0, which is not the same year.
* Respondent '140'
* Respondent '107' ( themselves)

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Find all respondents with the same gender as respondent '121', excluding the respondent themselves.
</task>","To find all respondents with the same gender as respondent '121', we first need to determine the gender of respondent '121'. According to the data, respondent '121' has a ""Gender"" of 1.0. Referring to the ""questions"" section, the ""Gender"" field is described as ""[MCQ: 1. Male 2. Female]"". Therefore, respondent '121' is male.

Now, we need to find all other respondents who are also male (have a ""Gender"" of 1.0), excluding respondent '121' themselves.

From the ""responses"" section:
- Respondent '100' has a ""Gender"" of 1.0.
- Respondent '12' has a ""Gender"" of 1.0.
- Respondent '96' has a ""Gender"" of 1.0.
- Respondent '65' has a ""Gender"" of 1.0.

All these respondents are male, like respondent '121', and are not respondent '121' themselves.

The list of respondents with the same gender as respondent '121', excluding respondent '121', is: 100, 12, 96, 65.",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents with the same gender as respondent '122', excluding the respondent themselves.
</task>","To find all respondents with the same gender as respondent '122', we first need to determine the gender of respondent '122'. According to the data, respondent '122' has a ""Gender"" of 2.0. 

Referring to the 'questions' section, the ""Gender"" field is described as ""[MCQ: 1. Male 2. Female]"". Therefore, a ""Gender"" of 2.0 corresponds to ""Female"".

Now, we need to find all other respondents who are also female (i.e., have a ""Gender"" of 2.0), excluding respondent '122' themselves.

The female respondents, excluding '122', are: 81, 132, 11, 52 does not match, 76 does not match, 12 does not match, 80 does not match, 140, 65 does not match, 10 does not match, 102 does not match.

So, the list of respondents with the same gender as respondent '122', excluding respondent '122', is: 81, 132, 11, 140",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents with the same gender as respondent '74', excluding the respondent themselves.
</task>","To find all respondents with the same gender as respondent '74', we first need to determine the gender of respondent '74'. According to the data, respondent '74' has a ""Gender"" of 1.0. Referring to the 'questions' section, ""Gender"" is defined as ""[MCQ: 1. Male 2. Female]"". Therefore, respondent '74' is male.

Now, we need to find all other respondents who are also male (Gender = 1.0), excluding respondent '74' themselves.

From the 'responses' section:
- Respondent '49' has a ""Gender"" of 2.0, which means female.
- Respondent '74' is the one we are matching and should be excluded.
- Respondent '92' has a ""Gender"" of 2.0, which means female.
- Respondent '13' has a ""Gender"" of 1.0, which means male.
- Respondent '85' has a ""Gender"" of 1.0, which means male.

Therefore, the respondents with the same gender as respondent '74' (male), excluding respondent '74', are '13' and '85'.",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents with the same gender as respondent '128', excluding the respondent themselves.
</task>","To find all respondents with the same gender as respondent '128', we first need to determine the gender of respondent '128'. According to the data, respondent '128' has a ""Gender"" of 1.0. Referring to the 'questions' section, ""Gender"" is defined as ""[MCQ: 1. Male 2. Female]"". Therefore, respondent '128' is male.

Now, we need to find all other respondents who are also male (Gender = 1.0), excluding respondent '128' themselves. 

Respondents with Gender = 1.0 are: 
- ""32""
- ""95""
- ""112""
- ""87""
- ""128"" (exclude this one)

So, the male respondents excluding '128' are: ""32"", ""95"", ""112"", ""87"".

The final answer is: 32, 95, 112, 87",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents who have the same 'Socio-economic status' as respondent '115'.
</task>","To find the respondents with the same 'Socio-economic status' as respondent '115', we first need to determine the 'Socio-economic status' of respondent '115'. According to the data, respondent '115' has a 'Socio-economic status' of 5.0.

Now, we will go through the responses to find all respondents with a 'Socio-economic status' of 5.0.

After reviewing the data, we find that there is only one respondent with a 'Socio-economic status' of 5.0, which is respondent '115' itself. There are no other respondents with the same 'Socio-economic status'.

Therefore, the list of respondents with the same 'Socio-economic status' as respondent '115' is empty, except for respondent '115' itself. However, since the task is to list other respondents with the same status, and given that '115' is the reference point, the answer would reflect that there are no additional respondents beyond '115' with the same socio-economic status. 

The final answer is: $\boxed{None}$",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents who have the same 'Socio-economic status' as respondent '115'.
</task>","To find the respondents with the same 'Socio-economic status' as respondent '115', we first need to determine the 'Socio-economic status' of respondent '115'. According to the data, respondent '115' has a 'Socio-economic status' of 5.0.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents with the same gender as respondent '72', excluding the respondent themselves.
</task>","To find all respondents with the same gender as respondent '72', we first need to determine the gender of respondent '72'. According to the data, respondent '72' has a ""Gender"" of 1.0, which corresponds to ""Male"" based on the schema ""[MCQ: 1. Male 2. Female]"".


Next, we will go through the responses to find all respondents who have a ""Gender"" of 1.0 (Male), excluding respondent '72' themselves.


The respondents with the same gender (Male) as respondent '72' are:

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents with the same gender as respondent '100', excluding the respondent themselves.
</task>","To find all respondents with the same gender as respondent '100', we first need to determine the gender of respondent '100'. According to the data, respondent '100' has a ""Gender"" of 1.0. Referring to the 'questions' section, ""Gender"" is defined as ""[MCQ: 1. Male 2. Female]"". Therefore, respondent '100' is male.

Now, we need to find all other respondents who are also male (Gender = 1.0), excluding respondent '100' themselves. 

Respondents with Gender = 1.0 are:
- ""7""

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Find all respondents who were born in the same year as respondent '32' and have a 'Happiness' score of 7 or more.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to find the year of birth of respondent '32' and then identify all respondents who were born in the same year and have a 'Happiness' score of 7 or more.

1. **Find the year of birth of respondent '32':**
   - Looking at the 'responses' section, we find respondent '32' and their year of birth is 2003.0.

2. **Identify respondents born in 2003 with a 'Happiness' score of 7 or more:**
   - We now go through each respondent in the 'responses' section to find those born in 2003 and with a 'Happiness' score of 7 or more.
   - Respondent '19' was born in 2003 but their 'Happiness' score is 6.0, which does not meet the criteria.
   - Respondent '114' was born in 2003 and their 'Happiness' score is 5.0, which also does not meet the criteria.
   - Respondent '32' themselves were born in 2003 but their 'Happiness' score is 1.0, not meeting the criteria.

Given the provided data, there are no respondents who meet both criteria of being born in the same year as respondent '32' (2003) and having a 'Happiness' score of 7 or more.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondents are the same gender as respondent '139' and also have a 'Life satisfaction' score greater than 7?
</task>","To answer this question, we first need to identify the gender of respondent '139' and then find all respondents who share the same gender and have a 'Life satisfaction' score greater than 7.

According to the data, respondent '139' has the following information:
- ""respondent"": ""139"",
- ""Gender"": 2.0,

From the 'questions' section, the gender options are defined as:
- ""Gender"": ""What is your gender? [MCQ: 1. Male 2. Female]"".

So, respondent '139' is female.

Next, we need to find all female respondents (since '139' is female) with a 'Life satisfaction' score greater than 7.

Here are the female respondents with their 'Life satisfaction' scores:
- Respondent '17': Female, 'Life satisfaction': 10.0
- Respondent '141': Female, 'Life satisfaction': 8.0
- Respondent '139': Female, 'Life satisfaction': 6.0 (Does not meet the criteria of 'Life satisfaction' > 7)
- Respondent '75': Male, (Does not meet the gender criteria)
- Respondent '77': Male, (Does not meet the gender criteria)
- Respondent '41': Female, 'Life satisfaction': 8.0
- Respondent '45': Male, (Does not meet the gender criteria)
- Respondent '93': Male, (Does not meet the gender criteria)
- Respondent '131': Female, 'Life satisfaction': 4.0 (Does not meet the criteria of 'Life satisfaction' > 7)
- Respondent '58': Male, (Does not meet the gender criteria)

The female respondents with 'Life satisfaction' scores greater than 7 are:
- '17'
- '141'
- '41'

Therefore, the respondents who are the same gender as respondent '139' and also have a 'Life satisfaction' score greater than 7 are '17, 141, 41'.",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents who were born in the same year as respondent '61' and have a 'Happiness' score of 4 or more.
</task>","To find the respondents who were born in the same year as respondent '61' and have a 'Happiness' score of 4 or more, we first need to identify the year of birth of respondent '61' and then filter the responses based on this year and the happiness score.

According to the data, respondent '61' was born in 2001. Now, we will look for respondents born in 2001 with a 'Happiness' score of 4 or more.

From the provided data:
- Respondent '61' was born in 2001 and has a happiness score of 9.
- No other respondent was born in 2001.

Therefore, the only respondent who meets both criteria is respondent '61'.",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents who have the same 'Socio-economic status' as respondent '120' and report a 'Stress' score of less than 4.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to identify the 'Socio-economic status' of respondent '120' and then find all respondents who share this status and have a 'Stress' score of less than 4.

1. **Identify the 'Socio-economic status' of respondent '120':**
   - Looking at the 'responses' section for respondent '120', we find that their 'Socio-economic status' is 2.0.

2. **Find all respondents with the same 'Socio-economic status' (2.0) and 'Stress' score less than 4:**
   - We iterate through each respondent in the 'responses' section and check two conditions:
     - If the 'Socio-economic status' is 2.0.
     - If the 'Stress' score is less than 4.
   - Respondents who meet both conditions are added to our list.

Let's examine the data:

- Respondent '120' has a 'Socio-economic status' of 2.0 and a 'Stress' score of 3.0, so they meet the criteria.
- Respondent '80' also has a 'Socio-economic status' of 2.0 but a 'Stress' score of 4.0, so they do not meet the criteria because their stress score is not less than 4.

Given the provided data, only respondent '120' meets the specified conditions.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents are the same gender as respondent '47' and also have a 'Life satisfaction' score greater than 7?
</task>","To answer this question, we first need to identify the gender of respondent '47' and then find all respondents who share the same gender and have a 'Life satisfaction' score greater than 7.

According to the data, respondent '47' has the following information:
- ""respondent"": ""47"",
- ""Gender"": 2.0,

From the 'questions' section, the ""Gender"" field is described as ""[MCQ: 1. Male 2. Female]"". Therefore, respondent '47' is female.

Next, we need to find all female respondents (Gender = 2.0) who have a 'Life satisfaction' score greater than 7.

After examining the data, the female respondents with a 'Life satisfaction' score greater than 7 are:
- Respondent '19' does not qualify because her 'Life satisfaction' score is 7.0.
- Respondent '33' does not qualify because her 'Life satisfaction' score is 5.0.
- Respondent '82' does not qualify because her 'Life satisfaction' score is 7.0.
- Respondent '116' does not qualify because he is male.
- Respondent '120' does not qualify because her 'Life satisfaction' score is 6.0.
- Respondent '133' does not qualify because her 'Life satisfaction' score is 6.0.
- Respondent '142' qualifies because she is female and her 'Life satisfaction' score is 7.0, but since the score must be greater than 7, she does not qualify.
- Respondent '47' herself qualifies because she is female and her 'Life satisfaction' score is 8.0.
- Respondent '89' is male, so does not qualify.
- Respondent '34' is male, so does not qualify.

Therefore, the respondents who are the same gender as respondent '47' (female) and have a 'Life satisfaction' score greater than 7 are:

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents are the same gender as respondent '58' and also have a 'Life satisfaction' score greater than 5?
</task>","To answer this question, we first need to identify the gender of respondent '58' and then find all respondents who share the same gender and have a 'Life satisfaction' score greater than 5.

1. **Identify the gender of respondent '58':** 
   - Respondent '58' has a ""Gender"" of 1.0. According to the ""Gender"" question in the schema, 1.0 corresponds to ""Male"".

2. **Find all respondents who are male and have a 'Life satisfaction' score greater than 5:**
   - We will iterate through each respondent in the 'responses' section, checking their ""Gender"" and ""Life satisfaction"" scores.

Respondents who are male (""Gender"" = 1.0) and have a ""Life satisfaction"" score greater than 5 are:
- Respondent ""129"" (Male, Life satisfaction = 7.0)
- Respondent ""15"" (Male, Life satisfaction = 7.0)
- Respondent ""32"" (Male, Life satisfaction = 7.0)
- Respondent ""40"" (Male, Life satisfaction = 8.0)
- Respondent ""78"" does not meet the criteria because the respondent is female (""Gender"" = 2.0).
- Respondent ""42"" (Male, Life satisfaction = 8.0)
- Respondent ""83"" (Male, Life satisfaction = 6.0) does not meet the ""Life satisfaction"" criteria.
- Respondent ""89"" (Male, Life satisfaction = 9.0)

Thus, the respondents who are the same gender as respondent '58' (Male) and also have a 'Life satisfaction' score greater than 5 are: 129, 15, 32, 40, 42, 89.",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents are the same gender as respondent '51' and also have a 'Life satisfaction' score greater than 5?
</task>","To answer this question, we first need to identify the gender of respondent '51' and then find all respondents who share the same gender and have a 'Life satisfaction' score greater than 5.

According to the data, respondent '51' has a ""Gender"" of 2.0, which corresponds to ""Female"" based on the schema ""[MCQ: 1. Male 2. Female]"".


Next, we filter the respondents to include only those with a ""Gender"" of 2.0 (Female) and a ""Life satisfaction"" score greater than 5.


The respondents who meet these criteria are:


- ""21"" with a ""Life satisfaction"" score of 5.0 (does not meet the criteria)
- ""51"" with a ""Life satisfaction"" score of 8.0 (meets the criteria)
- ""142"" with a ""Life satisfaction"" score of 7.0 (meets the criteria)
- ""71"" with a ""Life satisfaction"" score of 5.0 (does not meet the criteria)
- ""33"" with a ""Life satisfaction"" score of 5.0 (does not meet the criteria)
- ""78"" is not female (does not meet the criteria)
- ""137"" is not female (does not meet the criteria)
- ""24"" with a ""Life satisfaction"" score of 8.0 (meets the criteria)
- ""129"" is not female (does not meet the criteria)
- ""44"" with a ""Life satisfaction"" score of 6.0 (meets the criteria)

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents who were born in the same year as respondent '11' and have a 'Happiness' score of 3 or more.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to find the year of birth of respondent '11' and then identify all respondents who were born in the same year and have a 'Happiness' score of 3 or more.

1. **Find the year of birth of respondent '11':**
   - Looking at the 'responses' section, we find respondent '11' and their year of birth is 1998.

2. **Identify respondents born in 1998 with a 'Happiness' score of 3 or more:**
   - We now need to go through all the respondents and find those who were born in 1998 and have a 'Happiness' score of 3 or more.
   - Respondent '11' is the only one born in 1998, and their 'Happiness' score is 5.0, which is more than 3.

Therefore, the respondent who meets the criteria is respondent '11'.",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents who have the same 'Socio-economic status' as respondent '140' and report a 'Stress' score of less than 4.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to identify the 'Socio-economic status' of respondent '140' and then find all respondents who share this status and have a 'Stress' score of less than 4.

1. **Identify the 'Socio-economic status' of respondent '140':**
   - Looking at the responses, respondent '140' has a 'Socio-economic status' of 2.0.

2. **Find all respondents with the same 'Socio-economic status' (2.0) and a 'Stress' score of less than 4:**
   - Respondent '140' themselves have a 'Stress' score of 4.0, which does not meet the criteria of less than 4.
   - Other respondents with a 'Socio-economic status' of 2.0 are '117', '19', and '124'.
   - '117' has a 'Stress' score of 3.0, which meets the criteria.
   - '19' has a 'Stress' score of 2.0, which meets the criteria.
   - '124' has a 'Stress' score of 2.0, which meets the criteria.

Therefore, the respondents who have the same 'Socio-economic status' as respondent '140' (which is 2.0) and report a 'Stress' score of less than 4 are '117', '19', and '124'.",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents are the same gender as respondent '107' and also have a 'Life satisfaction' score greater than 5?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to identify the gender of respondent '107' and then find all respondents who share the same gender and have a 'Life satisfaction' score greater than 5.

1. **Identify the gender of respondent '107':** 
   - Respondent '107' has a ""Gender"" answer of 1.0.
   - According to the ""Gender"" question in the schema, 1.0 corresponds to ""Male"".

2. **Find all respondents who are male and have a 'Life satisfaction' score greater than 5:**
   - We will iterate through each respondent in the 'responses' section.
   - We check if the respondent's ""Gender"" is 1.0 (Male) and if their ""Life satisfaction"" score is greater than 5.

Respondents who match these criteria are:
- ""41"" (Male, Life satisfaction: 8.0)
- ""124"" (Male, Life satisfaction: 7.0)
- ""88"" (Male, Life satisfaction: 7.0)
- ""37"" (Male, Life satisfaction: 8.0)

Therefore, the respondents who are the same gender as respondent '107' (Male) and also have a 'Life satisfaction' score greater than 5 are: 41, 124, 88, 37.",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents are the same gender as respondent '28' and also have a 'Life satisfaction' score greater than 6?
</task>","To answer this question, we first need to identify the gender of respondent '28' and then find all respondents who share the same gender and have a 'Life satisfaction' score greater than 6.

According to the data, respondent '28' has a ""Gender"" of 1.0, which corresponds to ""Male"" based on the schema ""[MCQ: 1. Male 2. Female]"".


Next, we filter the respondents to include only those with a ""Gender"" of 1.0 (Male) and a ""Life satisfaction"" score greater than 6.


The respondents who match these criteria are:


- Respondent '89' with a ""Life satisfaction"" score of 9.0
- Respondent '95' with a ""Life satisfaction"" score of 8.0
- Respondent '34' is the respondent '28' itself, so it also matches with a ""Life satisfaction"" score of 7.0, but since the question asks for other respondents like '28', we include it in the consideration as it fits the criteria.


Therefore, the list of respondents who are the same gender as respondent '28' and also have a 'Life satisfaction' score greater than 6 is: 89, 95, 28",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Which respondents are the same gender as respondent '75' and also have a 'Life satisfaction' score greater than 6?
</task>","To answer this question, we first need to identify the gender of respondent '75' and then find all respondents who share the same gender and have a 'Life satisfaction' score greater than 6.

According to the data, respondent '75' has a ""Gender"" of 1.0, which corresponds to ""Male"" based on the schema ""[MCQ: 1. Male 2. Female]"".

Next, we filter the respondents to include only those with a ""Gender"" of 1.0 (Male) and a ""Life satisfaction"" score greater than 6.

The respondents who match these criteria are:
- Respondent '69' (Male, Life satisfaction: 4.0) does not match because the life satisfaction score is not greater than 6.
- Respondent '116' (Male, Life satisfaction: 6.0) does not match because the life satisfaction score is exactly 6, not greater than 6.
- Respondent '13' (Male, Life satisfaction: 7.0) matches the criteria.
- Respondent '75' himself (Male, Life satisfaction: 8.0) matches the criteria.
- Respondent '99' (Male, Life satisfaction: 5.0) does not match because the life satisfaction score is not greater than 6.

Therefore, the respondents who are the same gender as respondent '75' and also have a 'Life satisfaction' score greater than 6 are '13' and '75'.",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents who were born in the same year as respondent '6' and have a 'Happiness' score of 5 or more.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to find the year of birth of respondent '6' and then identify all respondents who were born in that year and have a 'Happiness' score of 5 or more.

1. **Find the year of birth of respondent '6':**
   - Looking at the 'responses' section for respondent '6', we find that their year of birth is 2006.

2. **Identify respondents born in 2006 with a 'Happiness' score of 5 or more:**
   - We now need to go through each respondent's data and check two conditions:
     - If their year of birth is 2006.
     - If their 'Happiness' score is 5 or more.
   - After reviewing the data, we find that respondent '6' is the only one born in 2006, and their 'Happiness' score is exactly 5, which meets the criteria.

Therefore, the respondent who was born in the same year as respondent '6' (2006) and has a 'Happiness' score of 5 or more is respondent '6' itself. 

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents who have the same 'Socio-economic status' as respondent '101' and report a 'Stress' score of less than 3.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to understand the 'Socio-economic status' of respondent '101' and then find all respondents who have the same status and report a 'Stress' score of less than 3.

1. **Find the 'Socio-economic status' of respondent '101':**
   - Looking at the 'responses' section, respondent '101' has a 'Socio-economic status' of 6.0.

2. **Identify all respondents with the same 'Socio-economic status' (6.0) and 'Stress' score less than 3:**
   - From the 'responses' section, we can see that respondents '101', '130', and '13' have a 'Socio-economic status' of 6.0.
   - Now, we check the 'Stress' score for each of these respondents:
     - Respondent '101' has a 'Stress' score of 3.0, which does not meet the criteria.
     - Respondent '130' has a 'Stress' score of 2.0, which meets the criteria.
     - Respondent '13' has a 'Stress' score of 2.0, which meets the criteria.

Therefore, the respondents who have the same 'Socio-economic status' as respondent '101' (6.0) and report a 'Stress' score of less than 3 are '130' and '13'.",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents who have the same 'Socio-economic status' as respondent '127' and report a 'Stress' score of less than 4.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to identify the 'Socio-economic status' of respondent '127' and then find all respondents who have the same status and report a 'Stress' score of less than 4.

From the provided data, respondent '127' has a 'Socio-economic status' of 4.0.

Now, we will list all respondents with a 'Socio-economic status' of 4.0 and a 'Stress' score of less than 4:

- Respondent '73' has a 'Socio-economic status' of 4.0 and a 'Stress' score of 4.0, which does not meet the criteria.
- Respondent '127' has a 'Socio-economic status' of 4.0 and a 'Stress' score of 2.0, which meets the criteria.
- Respondent '121' has a 'Socio-economic status' of 4.0 and a 'Stress' score of 4.0, which does not meet the criteria.
- Respondent '111' has a 'Socio-economic status' of 4.0 and a 'Stress' score of 2.0, which meets the criteria.

Therefore, the respondents who have the same 'Socio-economic status' as respondent '127' and report a 'Stress' score of less than 4 are '127' and '111'.",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'Happiness' score is higher than the average 'Happiness' for all respondents born in the same year as respondent '50'.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Happiness' score for all respondents born in the same year as respondent '50'. Respondent '50' was born in 2003.

1. **Identify respondents born in 2003**: From the data, we find that respondent '50' is the only one born in 2003 with a 'Happiness' score of 10.0.

2. **Calculate the average 'Happiness' for 2003**: Since there's only one respondent from 2003, the average 'Happiness' score is 10.0.

3. **Find respondents with 'Happiness' higher than the average**: Given that the average 'Happiness' score for those born in 2003 is 10.0, we need to find respondents whose 'Happiness' score is higher than 10.0. However, since the maximum score for 'Happiness' is 10, there are no respondents with a score higher than 10.0.

Therefore, the list of respondents whose 'Happiness' score is higher than the average 'Happiness' for all respondents born in the same year as respondent '50' is empty.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'Happiness' score is higher than the average 'Happiness' for all respondents born in the same year as respondent '116'.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to find the year of birth of respondent '116' and then calculate the average 'Happiness' score for all respondents born in that year. Afterward, we will identify respondents whose 'Happiness' score is higher than this average.

1. **Find the year of birth of respondent '116':**
   - Respondent '116' was born in 2002.

2. **Calculate the average 'Happiness' score for all respondents born in 2002:**
   - Respondents born in 2002 are: '74', '116', '130', '72', and '31'.
   - Their 'Happiness' scores are: 3.0, 6.0, 8.0, 7.0, and 6.0 respectively.
   - Average 'Happiness' = (3.0 + 6.0 + 8.0 + 7.0 + 6.0) / 5 = 30.0 / 5 = 6.0

3. **Identify respondents whose 'Happiness' score is higher than the average 'Happiness' for those born in 2002:**
   - The average 'Happiness' score for respondents born in 2002 is 6.0.
   - We look for respondents with a 'Happiness' score higher than 6.0 among those born in 2002.
   - Respondents '130' and '72' have 'Happiness' scores of 8.0 and 7.0 respectively, which are higher than the average.

Therefore, the respondents whose 'Happiness' score is higher than the average 'Happiness' for all respondents born in the same year as respondent '116' are '130' and '72'.",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondents have a total 'Anxiety Symptoms' score that is lower than the average total 'Depressive Symptoms' score for all respondents of the same gender?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the total 'Anxiety Symptoms' score and the total 'Depressive Symptoms' score for each respondent. Then, we calculate the average total 'Depressive Symptoms' score for all respondents of the same gender. Finally, we compare the total 'Anxiety Symptoms' score of each respondent with the average total 'Depressive Symptoms' score of their respective gender and list those who have a lower 'Anxiety Symptoms' score.

Given the complexity and the amount of data, let's break down the steps:

1. **Calculate Total 'Anxiety Symptoms' and 'Depressive Symptoms' Scores for Each Respondent:**
   - For each respondent, sum up all the scores under ""Anxiety Symptoms Frequency"" and ""Depressive Symptoms Frequency"".

2. **Calculate Average Total 'Depressive Symptoms' Score by Gender:**
   - Separate respondents by gender.
   - For each gender, sum up all the total 'Depressive Symptoms' scores and divide by the number of respondents of that gender.

3. **Compare and List Respondents:**
   - For each respondent, compare their total 'Anxiety Symptoms' score with the average total 'Depressive Symptoms' score of their gender.
   - List the respondents whose total 'Anxiety Symptoms' score is lower than the average total 'Depressive Symptoms' score of their gender.

Let's execute these steps with the provided data:

### Step 1: Calculate Total Scores

- Respondent 101:
  - Anxiety: 2 + 2 + 1 + 0 + 3 = 8
  - Depressive: 2 + 2 + 2 + 0 + 2 + 0 + 0 = 8
- Respondent 96:
  - Anxiety: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 6
  - Depressive: 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 1
- Respondent 87:
  - Anxiety: 2 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 5
  - Depressive: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 6
- Respondent 143:
  - Anxiety: 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 8
  - Depressive: 2 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 11
- Respondent 94:
  - Anxiety: 3 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 3
  - Depressive: 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 1
- Respondent 37:
  - Anxiety: 3 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 11
  - Depressive: 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 4
- Respondent 51:
  - Anxiety: 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 7
  - Depressive: 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 0 = 9
- Respondent 131:
  - Anxiety: 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 9
  - Depressive: 2 + 3 + 2 + 0 + 2 + 0 + 0 = 9

### Step 2: Calculate Average 'Depressive Symptoms' by Gender

- **Male (Gender: 1):**
  - Respondents: 96, 87, 143
  - Total Depressive Scores: 1 (96) + 6 (87) + 11 (143) = 18
  - Average: 18 / 3 = 6
- **Female (Gender: 2):**
  - Respondents: 101, 94, 37, 51, 131
  - Total Depressive Scores: 8 (101) + 1 (94) + 4 (37) + 9 (51) + 9 (131) = 31
  - Average: 31 / 5 = 6.2

### Step 3: Compare and List

- **Males:**
  - 96: Anxiety (6) vs. Average Depressive (6) - Lower
  - 87: Anxiety (5) vs. Average Depressive (6) - Lower
  - 143: Anxiety (8) vs. Average Depressive (6) - Not Lower
- **Females:**
  - 101: Anxiety (8) vs. Average Depressive (6.2) - Not Lower
  - 94: Anxiety (3) vs. Average Depressive (6.2) - Lower
  - 37: Anxiety (11) vs. Average Depressive (6.2) - Not Lower
  - 51: Anxiety (7) vs. Average Depressive (6.2) - Not Lower
  - 131: Anxiety (9) vs. Average Depressive (6.2) - Not Lower

Respondents with a total 'Anxiety Symptoms' score lower than the average total 'Depressive Symptoms' score for their gender are: 96, 87, 94.",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'Happiness' score is higher than the average 'Happiness' for all respondents born in the same year as respondent '133'.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to find the year of birth of respondent '133' and then calculate the average 'Happiness' score for all respondents born in that year. Afterward, we will identify respondents whose 'Happiness' score is higher than this average.

1. **Find the year of birth of respondent '133':**
   - Respondent '133' was born in 2002.

2. **Calculate the average 'Happiness' score for all respondents born in 2002:**
   - Respondents born in 2002 are '10', '133', and '132' is not born in 2002 but '10' and '133' are.
   - '10' has a 'Happiness' score of 10.0.
   - '133' has a 'Happiness' score of 6.0.
   - Average 'Happiness' = (10.0 + 6.0) / 2 = 8.0.

3. **Identify respondents whose 'Happiness' score is higher than the average 'Happiness' for those born in 2002 (which is 8.0):**
   - We need to check each respondent's 'Happiness' score and compare it to 8.0.

Respondents and their 'Happiness' scores:
- '129': 8.0
- '11': 5.0
- '12': 9.0
- '10': 10.0
- '36': 8.0
- '86': 5.0
- '122': 8.0
- '133': 6.0
- '117': 10.0
- '39': 8.0
- '132': 5.0

Higher than 8.0:
- '12': 9.0
- '10': 10.0
- '117': 10.0

Therefore, the respondents whose 'Happiness' score is higher than the average 'Happiness' for all respondents born in the same year as respondent '133' are '12', '10', '117'.",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'Happiness' score is higher than the average 'Happiness' for all respondents born in the same year as respondent '130'.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to find the year of birth of respondent '130' and then calculate the average 'Happiness' score for all respondents born in that year. Afterward, we will identify respondents whose 'Happiness' score is higher than this average.

1. **Find the year of birth of respondent '130':**
   - Respondent '130' was born in 2002.

2. **Calculate the average 'Happiness' score for all respondents born in 2002:**
   - Respondents born in 2002 are '84', '82', '77', and '130'.
   - Their 'Happiness' scores are 8.0, 6.0, 7.0, and 8.0, respectively.
   - Average 'Happiness' = (8.0 + 6.0 + 7.0 + 8.0) / 4 = 29.0 / 4 = 7.25.

3. **Identify respondents whose 'Happiness' score is higher than the average 'Happiness' for those born in 2002 (7.25):**
   - We need to check all respondents, not just those born in 2002, to find whose 'Happiness' score exceeds 7.25.
   - Going through each respondent's data:
     - '84': 8.0 (higher)
     - '82': 6.0 (lower)
     - '42': 6.0 (lower)
     - '101': 4.0 (lower)
     - '77': 7.0 (lower)
     - '87': 8.0 (higher)
     - '130': 8.0 (higher)
     - '131': 6.0 (lower)
     - '137': 7.0 (lower)

Respondents with 'Happiness' scores higher than 7.25 are '84', '87', and '130'. 

The final answer is: $\boxed{84, 87, 130}$",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
List all respondents who have more years of father's education than the average mother's education for all respondents with the same 'Socio-economic status'.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average mother's education for all respondents with the same 'Socio-economic status' as respondent '119'. However, since '119' is not present in the provided data, we will assume the task is to compare each respondent's father's education to the average mother's education of all respondents with the same 'Socio-economic status' as themselves.

Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify Unique Socio-economic Statuses**: Determine the unique 'Socio-economic status' values in the dataset.
2. **Calculate Average Mother's Education for Each Socio-economic Status**: For each unique 'Socio-economic status', calculate the average 'Mother' education from 'Parental Education'.
3. **Compare Father's Education to Average Mother's Education for Each Respondent**: For each respondent, compare their father's education to the average mother's education of their respective 'Socio-economic status' group.
4. **List Respondents with More Years of Father's Education**: List the respondents who have more years of father's education than the average mother's education for their 'Socio-economic status'.

Given the complexity and the need for precise calculations based on the provided data, let's proceed with the analysis:

### Step 1: Identify Unique Socio-economic Statuses

From the data, the unique 'Socio-economic status' values are: 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6.

### Step 2: Calculate Average Mother's Education for Each Socio-economic Status

- **Socio-economic status = 1**: Respondents '85', '107', '79' have mothers' education data. Average = (None + 6 + 11) / 3 = 17 / 3 = 5.67
- **Socio-economic status = 2**: Respondent '29' has mother's education data. Average = 7
- **Socio-economic status = 3**: Respondents '145', '77', '122' have mothers' education data. Average = (15 + None + 16) / 3 = 31 / 3 = 10.33
- **Socio-economic status = 5**: Respondents '95', '150', '7' have mothers' education data. Average = (None + None + 17) / 3 = 17 / 3 = 5.67
- **Socio-economic status = 6**: Respondent '5' has mother's education data. Average = 6

### Step 3 & 4: Compare and List

- **Socio-economic status = 1**:
  - '85': No father's education data.
  - '107': Father's education = 7, Average mother's education = 5.67. Included.
  - '79': Father's education = 11, Average mother's education = 5.67. Included.
- **Socio-economic status = 2**:
  - '29': Father's education = 11, Average mother's education = 7. Included.
- **Socio-economic status = 3**:
  - '145': Father's education = 25, Average mother's education = 10.33. Included.
  - '77': No father's education data.
  - '122': Father's education = 16, Average mother's education = 10.33. Included.
- **Socio-economic status = 5**:

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
List all respondents who have more years of father's education than the average mother's education for all respondents with the same 'Socio-economic status'.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average mother's education for each socio-economic status group. Then, we compare each respondent's father's education to this average within their respective socio-economic status group.

Given the data, we will follow these steps:

1. Calculate the average mother's education for each socio-economic status.
2. Identify respondents with more years of father's education than the average mother's education within their socio-economic status group.

Let's start by calculating the average mother's education for each socio-economic status group.

- Socio-economic status 2: 
  - Respondent 59: Mother's education = 9 years.
  - Respondent 44: Mother's education = 17 years.
  Average = (9 + 17) / 2 = 13 years.
- Socio-economic status 3: 
  - Respondent 122: Mother's education = 16 years.
  - Respondent 148: No mother's education data.
  - Respondent 14: No mother's education data.
  - Respondent 98: No mother's education data.
  Since we only have data for respondent 122, we cannot accurately calculate an average. However, for the purpose of comparison, we'll note this value.
- Socio-economic status 4: 
  - Respondent 149: Mother's education = 16 years.
  - Respondent 135: Mother's education = 11 years.
  - Respondent 38: Mother's education = 24 years.
  Average = (16 + 11 + 24) / 3 = 17 years.
- Socio-economic status 5: 
  - Respondent 150: No mother's education data.
  - Respondent 123: Mother's education = 18 years.
  Since we only have data for respondent 123, we cannot accurately calculate an average. However, for the purpose of comparison, we'll note this value.
- Socio-economic status 6: 
  - Respondent 68: Mother's education = 20 years.
  Since we only have data for respondent 68, we cannot accurately calculate an average. However, for the purpose of comparison, we'll note this value.

Now, let's compare each respondent's father's education to the average mother's education within their socio-economic status group:

- Socio-economic status 2:
  - Respondent 59: Father's education = 12 years, less than the average mother's education (13 years).
  - Respondent 44: Father's education = 17 years, more than the average mother's education (13 years).
- Socio-economic status 3:
  - Due to missing data, we cannot make a direct comparison for most respondents. However, respondent 122 has a father's education of 16 years, but without a clear average for comparison, we cannot definitively include or exclude them based on the initial instruction.
- Socio-economic status 4:
  - Respondent 149: Father's education = 18 years, more than the average mother's education (17 years).
  - Respondent 135: Father's education = 10 years, less than the average mother's education (17 years).
  - Respondent 38: Father's education = 22 years, more than the average mother's education (17 years).
- Socio-economic status 5:
  - Respondent 150: No father's or mother's education data for comparison.
  - Respondent 123: Father's education = 18 years. Without an average for comparison, we cannot definitively include or exclude them.
- Socio-economic status 6:
  - Respondent 68: Father's education = 20 years. Without an average for comparison (only one data point), we cannot definitively include or exclude them based on the initial instruction.

Based on the comparisons we can make:

Respondents with more years of father's education than the average mother's education within their socio-economic status group are:
- Respondent 44 (Socio-economic status 2)
- Respondent 149 (Socio-economic status 4)
- Respondent 38 (Socio-economic status 4)

Therefore, the list of respondents who meet the criteria is: 44, 149, 38.",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'Happiness' score is higher than the average 'Happiness' for all respondents born in the same year as respondent '81'.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Happiness' score for all respondents born in the same year as respondent '81', which is 2002. Then, we compare this average with the 'Happiness' scores of all respondents to find those whose scores are higher.

1. **Identify respondents born in 2002:**
   - Respondent '9' was born in 2002.
   - Respondent '81' was born in 2002.
   - Respondent '113' was born in 2002.
   - Respondent '108' was born in 2001, so not included.
   - Other respondents were born in different years.

2. **Calculate the average 'Happiness' score for these respondents:**
   - Respondent '9' has a 'Happiness' score of 8.
   - Respondent '81' has a 'Happiness' score of 6.
   - Respondent '113' has a 'Happiness' score of 8.
   - Average 'Happiness' = (8 + 6 + 8) / 3 = 22 / 3 = 7.33.

3. **Find all respondents with a 'Happiness' score higher than 7.33:**
   - Respondent '9' has a score of 8, which is higher.
   - Respondent '113' has a score of 8, which is higher.
   - Respondent '147' has a 'Happiness' score of 9, which is higher.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
List all respondents who have more years of father's education than the average mother's education for all respondents with the same 'Socio-economic status'.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average mother's education for each socio-economic status group. Then, we compare each respondent's father's education to this average within their respective socio-economic status group.

Given the data, we will follow these steps:

1. Calculate the average mother's education for each socio-economic status.
2. Identify respondents with more years of father's education than the average mother's education within their socio-economic status group.

Let's start by calculating the average mother's education for each socio-economic status:

- Socio-economic status 1: Respondent 133 has no parental education data.
- Socio-economic status 2: Respondents 53 (Mother: 5.0), 16 (no data).
- Socio-economic status 3: Respondents 36 (no data), 54 (Father: 18.0, but we need mother's for average), 84 (Mother: 16.0), 144 (Mother: 4.0).
- Socio-economic status 4: Respondent 106 (Mother: 17.0), 121 (Mother: 20.0).
- Socio-economic status 5: Respondents 129 (no data), 123 (Mother: 18.0).

Calculating averages where possible:

- Socio-economic status 2: Average mother's education = (5.0) / 1 = 5.0
- Socio-economic status 3: Average mother's education = (16.0 + 4.0) / 2 = 10.0
- Socio-economic status 4: Average mother's education = (17.0 + 20.0) / 2 = 18.5
- Socio-economic status 5: Average mother's education = (18.0) / 1 = 18.0

Now, comparing each respondent's father's education to the average mother's education within their socio-economic status:

- Socio-economic status 1: No comparison possible due to lack of data.
- Socio-economic status 2: Respondent 53 (Father: 3.0) does not have more education than the average mother's (5.0). Respondent 16 has no father's education data.
- Socio-economic status 3: Respondent 36 (no data), Respondent 54 (Father: 18.0) has more than the average mother's education (10.0), Respondent 84 (Father: 18.0) has more, Respondent 144 (Father: 4.0) does not.
- Socio-economic status 4: Respondent 106 (Father: 17.0) does not have more than the average mother's education (18.5), Respondent 121 (Father: 25.0) has more.
- Socio-economic status 5: Respondent 129 (no data), Respondent 123 (Father: 18.0) has the same as the average mother's education (18.0).

Respondents with more years of father's education than the average mother's education within their socio-economic status group are:

54, 84, 121

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'Happiness' score is higher than the average 'Happiness' for all respondents born in the same year as respondent '68'.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to find the year of birth of respondent '68' and then calculate the average 'Happiness' score for all respondents born in that year. Afterward, we will identify respondents whose 'Happiness' score is higher than this average.

1. **Find the year of birth of respondent '68':**
   - Respondent '68' was born in 2004.

2. **Calculate the average 'Happiness' score for all respondents born in 2004:**
   - Respondent '68' has a 'Happiness' score of 5.0.
   - There are no other respondents born in 2004 in the provided data, so the average 'Happiness' score for 2004 is 5.0.

3. **Identify respondents whose 'Happiness' score is higher than the average 'Happiness' for all respondents born in 2004 (5.0):**
   - We need to list all respondents with a 'Happiness' score greater than 5.0.

Respondents with 'Happiness' scores higher than 5.0 are:
- Respondent '81' with a score of 6.0
- Respondent '45' with a score of 9.0
- Respondent '118' with a score of 5.0 (not higher, exactly the average, so not included)
- Respondent '137' with a score of 7.0
- Respondent '88' with a score of 5.0 (not higher, exactly the average, so not included)
- Respondent '140' with a score of 5.0
- Respondent '91' with a score of 7.0
- Respondent '124' with a score of 7.0
- Respondent '50' with a score of 10.0
- Respondent '64' with a score of 9.0

Thus, the respondents whose 'Happiness' score is higher than the average 'Happiness' for all respondents born in the same year as respondent '68' are: 81, 45, 137, 91, 124, 50, 64.",False
