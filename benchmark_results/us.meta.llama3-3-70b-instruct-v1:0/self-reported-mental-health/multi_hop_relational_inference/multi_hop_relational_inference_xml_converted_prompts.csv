<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents with the same gender as respondent '90', excluding the respondent themselves.
</task>","To find all respondents with the same gender as respondent '90', we first need to determine the gender of respondent '90'. According to the data, respondent '90' has a gender answer of ""1.0"", which corresponds to ""Male"" based on the question schema for ""Gender"" ([MCQ: 1. Male 2. Female]).

Now, we will go through the responses to find all respondents who also have a gender answer of ""1.0"" (Male), excluding respondent '90' themselves.

Respondents with the same gender (Male) as respondent '90' are:
- Respondent '112' (Gender: 1.0)
- Respondent '57' (Gender: 1.0)
- Respondent '116' (Gender: 1.0)
- Respondent '7' (Gender: 1.0)
- Respondent '107' (Gender: 1.0)

Therefore, the list of respondent IDs with the same gender as respondent '90', excluding respondent '90', is: 112, 57, 116, 7, 107.",False

- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Find all respondents with the same gender as respondent '108', excluding the respondent themselves.
</task>","To find all respondents with the same gender as respondent '108', we first need to determine the gender of respondent '108'. According to the data, respondent '108' has a gender answer of ""2.0"". Referring to the 'questions' section, the gender question is a MCQ with options ""1. Male"" and ""2. Female"". Therefore, respondent '108' is female.

Now, we need to find all other respondents who are also female, excluding respondent '108' themselves. 

Female respondents (excluding '108') are: 74 is male, 61 is male, 78 is female, 32 is male, 13 is male, 62 is female, 118 is female, 17 is female, 128 is male.

So, the female respondents (excluding '108') are 78, 62, 118, 17. 

The answer is: 78, 62, 118, 17",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Find all respondents with the same gender as respondent '132', excluding the respondent themselves.
</task>","To find all respondents with the same gender as respondent '132', we first need to determine the gender of respondent '132'. According to the data, respondent '132' has an answer for the ""Gender"" question as ""2.0"". Referring to the 'questions' section, the ""Gender"" question is defined as ""[MCQ: 1. Male 2. Female]"". Therefore, respondent '132' is female.

Now, we need to find all other respondents who are also female, excluding respondent '132' themselves. We look through the responses and find the following respondents with a ""Gender"" answer of ""2.0"", which corresponds to ""Female"":

- Respondent '62'
- Respondent '37'

These are the respondents with the same gender as respondent '132', excluding respondent '132' themselves. 

The final answer is: $\boxed{62, 37}$",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Find all respondents with the same gender as respondent '121', excluding the respondent themselves.
</task>","To find all respondents with the same gender as respondent '121', excluding the respondent themselves, we first need to determine the gender of respondent '121'. According to the data, respondent '121' has an answer for the ""Gender"" question as ""1.0"". Referring to the 'questions' section, the ""Gender"" question is defined as ""[MCQ: 1. Male 2. Female]"". Therefore, respondent '121' is male.

Now, we need to find all other respondents who are also male, excluding respondent '121'. 

Respondent '100' is male because their answer to the ""Gender"" question is ""1.0"".
Respondent '12' is male because their answer to the ""Gender"" question is ""1.0"".
Respondent '96' is male because their answer to the ""Gender"" question is ""1.0"".
Respondent '65' is male because their answer to the ""Gender"" question is ""1.0"".

Since all these respondents are male and none of them is respondent '121', they all match the criteria.

The final answer is: $\boxed{100, 12, 96, 65}$",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Find all respondents with the same gender as respondent '122', excluding the respondent themselves.
</task>","To find all respondents with the same gender as respondent '122', we first need to determine the gender of respondent '122'. According to the data, respondent '122' has a gender answer of ""2.0"". Referring to the 'questions' section, the gender question is a MCQ with options ""1. Male"" and ""2. Female"". Therefore, respondent '122' is female.

Now, we need to find all other respondents who are also female, excluding respondent '122' themselves. 

Female respondents (excluding '122') are: 11, 12, 52, 65, 76, 80, 81, 102, 132, 140 

However, we need to ensure these respondents are indeed female based on their answer to the gender question. 

Respondent '11' answered ""1.0"", which corresponds to ""Male"".
Respondent '12' answered ""1.0"", which corresponds to ""Male"".
Respondent '52' answered ""1.0"", which corresponds to ""Male"".
Respondent '65' answered ""1.0"", which corresponds to ""Male"".
Respondent '76' answered ""1.0"", which corresponds to ""Male"".
Respondent '80' answered ""1.0"", which corresponds to ""Male"".
Respondent '81' answered ""2.0"", which corresponds to ""Female"".
Respondent '102' answered ""1.0"", which corresponds to ""Male"".
Respondent '132' answered ""2.0"", which corresponds to ""Female"".
Respondent '140' answered ""2.0"", which corresponds to ""Female"".

So, the female respondents, excluding '122', are 81, 132, 140.",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Find all respondents with the same gender as respondent '74', excluding the respondent themselves.
</task>","To find all respondents with the same gender as respondent '74', we first need to determine the gender of respondent '74'. According to the data, respondent '74' has a gender answer of ""1.0"", which corresponds to ""Male"" based on the question schema for ""Gender"": ""What is your gender? [MCQ: 1. Male 2. Female]"".


Now, we will go through the responses to find all respondents who also have a gender answer of ""1.0"" (Male), excluding respondent '74' themselves.


Respondent '49' has a gender of ""2.0"", which is Female.


Respondent '92' has a gender of ""2.0"", which is Female.


Respondent '13' has a gender of ""1.0"", which is Male.


Respondent '85' has a gender of ""1.0"", which is Male.


Therefore, the respondents with the same gender as respondent '74' (Male), excluding respondent '74' themselves, are '13' and '85'.",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Find all respondents with the same gender as respondent '128', excluding the respondent themselves.
</task>","To find all respondents with the same gender as respondent '128', we first need to determine the gender of respondent '128'. According to the data, respondent '128' has a gender answer of ""1.0"", which corresponds to ""Male"" based on the question schema for ""Gender"" ([MCQ: 1. Male 2. Female]).

Now, we will go through the responses to find all respondents who also have a gender answer of ""1.0"" (Male), excluding respondent '128' themselves.

Respondents with the same gender (Male) as respondent '128' are:
- Respondent '32'
- Respondent '95'
- Respondent '112'
- Respondent '99'
- Respondent '87'
- Respondent '48' is female, so not included.

Thus, the list of respondent IDs with the same gender as respondent '128', excluding respondent '128', is: 32, 95, 112, 99, 87.",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents who have the same 'Socio-economic status' as respondent '115'.
</task>","To find the respondents with the same 'Socio-economic status' as respondent '115', we first need to determine the 'Socio-economic status' of respondent '115'. According to the data, respondent '115' has a 'Socio-economic status' of 5.0.

Now, we will look through the responses to find all respondents who also have a 'Socio-economic status' of 5.0.

Respondent '115' has a 'Socio-economic status' of 5.0. 

After reviewing the data, we find that only respondent '104' also has a 'Socio-economic status' of 5.0.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Find all respondents with the same gender as respondent '72', excluding the respondent themselves.
</task>","To find all respondents with the same gender as respondent '72', we first need to determine the gender of respondent '72'. According to the data, respondent '72' has a gender answer of ""1.0"", which corresponds to ""Male"" based on the question schema for ""Gender"" ([MCQ: 1. Male 2. Female]).

Now, we will go through the responses to find all respondents who also have a gender answer of ""1.0"" (Male), excluding respondent '72' themselves.

Respondents with the same gender (Male) as respondent '72' are:
- Respondent '114' (Gender: 1.0)
- Respondent '20' (Gender: 1.0)
- Respondent '102' (Gender: 1.0)

Therefore, the list of respondent IDs with the same gender as respondent '72', excluding respondent '72' themselves, is: 114, 20, 102.",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Find all respondents with the same gender as respondent '100', excluding the respondent themselves.
</task>","To find all respondents with the same gender as respondent '100', we first need to determine the gender of respondent '100'. According to the data, respondent '100' has a gender answer of ""1.0"", which corresponds to ""Male"" based on the question schema for ""Gender"" that states ""[MCQ: 1. Male 2. Female]"".

Now, we will go through the responses to find all respondents who also have a gender answer of ""1.0"" (Male), excluding respondent '100' themselves.

Respondents with the same gender (Male) as respondent '100' are:
- Respondent '7'
- Respondent '128'

Therefore, the list of respondent IDs with the same gender as respondent '100', excluding respondent '100', is: 7, 128.",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Find all respondents who were born in the same year as respondent '32' and have a 'Happiness' score of 7 or more.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to find the year of birth of respondent '32' and then identify all respondents who were born in the same year and have a 'Happiness' score of 7 or more.


Respondent '32' was born in the year 2003.0.


Now, let's find all respondents born in 2003.0 with a 'Happiness' score of 7 or more.


Respondent '19' was born in 2003.0 and has a 'Happiness' score of 6.0, which is less than 7.


Respondent '114' was born in 2003.0 and has a 'Happiness' score of 5.0, which is less than 7.


No other respondents were born in 2003.0 with a 'Happiness' score of 7 or more.


Since there are no respondents who meet the criteria, the answer is:

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondents are the same gender as respondent '139' and also have a 'Life satisfaction' score greater than 7?
</task>","To answer this question, we first need to identify the gender of respondent '139' and then find all respondents who share this gender and have a 'Life satisfaction' score greater than 7.

According to the data, respondent '139' has the following answer for 'Gender':
<answer question=""Gender"">2.0</answer>

Referring to the 'questions' section, the 'Gender' question is defined as:
<question id=""Gender"">What is your gender? [MCQ: 1. Male 2. Female]</question>

So, respondent '139' is female.

Next, we look for all female respondents (those with 'Gender' answer as '2.0') who have a 'Life satisfaction' score greater than 7.

From the data, the female respondents with 'Life satisfaction' scores are:
- Respondent '17': <answer question=""Gender"">2.0</answer> and <answer question=""Life satisfaction"">10.0</answer>
- Respondent '141': <answer question=""Gender"">2.0</answer> and <answer question=""Life satisfaction"">8.0</answer>
- Respondent '139': <answer question=""Gender"">2.0</answer> and <answer question=""Life satisfaction"">6.0</answer> (Does not meet the 'Life satisfaction' criteria)
- Respondent '131': <answer question=""Gender"">2.0</answer> and <answer question=""Life satisfaction"">4.0</answer> (Does not meet the 'Life satisfaction' criteria)

Thus, the respondents who are the same gender as respondent '139' (female) and have a 'Life satisfaction' score greater than 7 are '17' and '141'. 

The final answer is: $\boxed{17, 141}$",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Find all respondents who were born in the same year as respondent '61' and have a 'Happiness' score of 4 or more.
</task>","To find the respondents who were born in the same year as respondent '61' and have a 'Happiness' score of 4 or more, we first need to identify the year of birth for respondent '61' and then filter the respondents based on this year and the 'Happiness' score criterion.


Respondent '61' was born in 2001.


Now, we filter the respondents to include only those born in 2001 and with a 'Happiness' score of 4 or more.


From the provided data:


- Respondent '61' was born in 2001 and has a 'Happiness' score of 9, which meets the criteria.


No other respondents were born in 2001 with a 'Happiness' score of 4 or more.


Therefore, the respondent who meets the specified conditions is:

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents who have the same 'Socio-economic status' as respondent '120' and report a 'Stress' score of less than 4.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to identify the 'Socio-economic status' of respondent '120' and then find all respondents who share this status and have a 'Stress' score of less than 4.

1. **Identify the 'Socio-economic status' of respondent '120':**
   - Looking at the responses for respondent '120', we find that their 'Socio-economic status' is 2.0.

2. **Find all respondents with the same 'Socio-economic status' (2.0) and 'Stress' score less than 4:**
   - We examine each respondent's data:
     - Respondent '142' has a 'Socio-economic status' of 3.0, which does not match.
     - Respondent '34' has a 'Socio-economic status' of 6.0, which does not match.
     - Respondent '23' has a 'Socio-economic status' of 5.0, which does not match.
     - Respondent '17' has a 'Socio-economic status' of 5.0, which does not match.
     - Respondent '80' has a 'Socio-economic status' of 2.0, which matches, and a 'Stress' score of 4.0, which does not meet the less than 4 criteria.
     - Respondent '102' has a 'Socio-economic status' of 5.0, which does not match.
     - Respondent '123' has a 'Socio-economic status' of 5.0, which does not match.
     - Respondent '135' has a 'Socio-economic status' of 4.0, which does not match.
     - Respondent '106' has a 'Socio-economic status' of 4.0, which does not match.
     - Respondent '120' themselves have a 'Stress' score of 3.0, which meets the criteria.

Given the information and the specific criteria, the only respondent who matches both conditions (same 'Socio-economic status' as '120' and 'Stress' score less than 4) is respondent '120' themselves. 

The final answer is: $\boxed{120}$",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondents are the same gender as respondent '47' and also have a 'Life satisfaction' score greater than 7?
</task>","To answer this question, we first need to identify the gender of respondent '47' and then find all respondents who share the same gender and have a 'Life satisfaction' score greater than 7.

According to the data, respondent '47' has the following information:
- Gender: 2.0
- Since the gender question is ""[MCQ: 1. Male 2. Female]"", respondent '47' is Female.

Next, we look for all female respondents (Gender = 2.0) with a 'Life satisfaction' score greater than 7.

Female respondents with 'Life satisfaction' greater than 7:
- Respondent '19': Female, 'Life satisfaction' = 7.0 (does not meet the criteria)
- Respondent '33': Female, 'Life satisfaction' = 5.0 (does not meet the criteria)
- Respondent '82': Female, 'Life satisfaction' = 7.0 (does not meet the criteria)
- Respondent '116': Male, (does not meet the gender criteria)
- Respondent '133': Female, 'Life satisfaction' = 6.0 (does not meet the criteria)
- Respondent '142': Female, 'Life satisfaction' = 7.0 (does not meet the criteria)
- Respondent '47': Female, 'Life satisfaction' = 8.0 (meets the criteria)
- Respondent '34': Male, (does not meet the gender criteria, but actually, the data shows '34' as Male, however, the gender is coded as 1.0 which corresponds to Male, my mistake in reading)
- Respondent '89': Male, (does not meet the gender criteria)
- Respondent '148': Male, (does not meet the gender criteria)
- Respondent '120': Male, (does not meet the gender criteria)

Correcting my analysis based on accurate gender identification:
- Respondent '47' is indeed Female, with 'Life satisfaction' = 8.0.
- Other females are '19', '33', '82', '133', and '142'. None of these have a 'Life satisfaction' score greater than 7 except for none, actually, '47' is the one with a score of 8.

Thus, the only respondent who is the same gender as '47' (Female) and has a 'Life satisfaction' score greater than 7 is '47' itself and possibly others not correctly identified due to oversight in my explanation. Let's correct that:

Upon re-evaluation:
- '19' is Female, 'Life satisfaction' = 7.0 (does not meet the criteria)
- '33' is Female, 'Life satisfaction' = 5.0 (does not meet the criteria)
- '82' is Female, 'Life satisfaction' = 7.0 (does not meet the criteria)
- '133' is Female, 'Life satisfaction' = 6.0 (does not meet the criteria)
- '142' is Female, 'Life satisfaction' = 7.0 (does not meet the criteria)
- '47' is Female, 'Life satisfaction' = 8.0 (meets the criteria)

The final answer is: $\boxed{47}$",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondents are the same gender as respondent '58' and also have a 'Life satisfaction' score greater than 5?
</task>","To answer this question, we first need to identify the gender of respondent '58' and then find all respondents who share the same gender and have a 'Life satisfaction' score greater than 5.

1. **Identify the gender of respondent '58':** 
   - Respondent '58' has an answer for the question ""Gender"" with a value of ""1.0"".
   - According to the ""Gender"" question in the schema, ""1.0"" corresponds to ""Male"".

2. **Find all respondents who are male and have a 'Life satisfaction' score greater than 5:**
   - We will iterate through each respondent's answers for ""Gender"" and ""Life satisfaction"".

Respondents and their relevant answers:
- **129:** Gender = ""1.0"" (Male), Life satisfaction = ""7.0""
- **15:** Gender = ""1.0"" (Male), Life satisfaction = ""7.0""
- **32:** Gender = ""1.0"" (Male), Life satisfaction = ""7.0""
- **133:** Gender = ""2.0"" (Female), Life satisfaction = ""6.0""
- **40:** Gender = ""1.0"" (Male), Life satisfaction = ""8.0""
- **78:** Gender = ""2.0"" (Female), Life satisfaction = ""9.0""
- **43:** Gender = ""2.0"" (Female), Life satisfaction = ""7.0""
- **42:** Gender = ""1.0"" (Male), Life satisfaction = ""8.0""
- **83:** Gender = ""1.0"" (Male), Life satisfaction = ""6.0""
- **58:** Gender = ""1.0"" (Male), Life satisfaction = ""7.0""
- **89:** Gender = ""1.0"" (Male), Life satisfaction = ""9.0""

Male respondents with a 'Life satisfaction' score greater than 5 are:
- 129
- 15
- 32
- 40
- 42
- 58
- 89

Therefore, the list of respondent IDs who are the same gender as respondent '58' and also have a 'Life satisfaction' score greater than 5 is: 129, 15, 32, 40, 42, 58, 89.",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
List all respondents who have the same 'Socio-economic status' as respondent '140' and report a 'Stress' score of less than 4.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to understand the 'Socio-economic status' of respondent '140' and then find all respondents who share this status and have a 'Stress' score of less than 4.

1. **Determine the 'Socio-economic status' of respondent '140':**
   - Looking at the responses for respondent '140', we find that their 'Socio-economic status' is **2.0**.

2. **Identify all respondents with the same 'Socio-economic status' (2.0) and a 'Stress' score of less than 4:**
   - We will go through each respondent's data to find those with a 'Socio-economic status' of **2.0** and a 'Stress' score less than **4**.

Respondents with 'Socio-economic status' of 2.0:
- Respondent '140' has a 'Stress' score of **4.0**, which does not meet the criteria.
- Respondent '124' has a 'Socio-economic status' of **2.0** and a 'Stress' score of **2.0**, which meets the criteria.
- Respondent '117' has a 'Socio-economic status' of **2.0** and a 'Stress' score of **3.0**, which meets the criteria.
- Respondent '19' has a 'Socio-economic status' of **2.0** and a 'Stress' score of **2.0**, which meets the criteria.

Therefore, the respondents who have the same 'Socio-economic status' as respondent '140' (which is 2.0) and report a 'Stress' score of less than 4 are: **124, 117, 19**.",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondents are the same gender as respondent '107' and also have a 'Life satisfaction' score greater than 5?
</task>","To answer this question, we first need to identify the gender of respondent '107' and then find all respondents who share this gender and have a 'Life satisfaction' score greater than 5.

1. **Identify the gender of respondent '107':** 
   - Respondent '107' has an answer for the question ""Gender"" with a value of ""1.0"".
   - According to the 'questions' schema, the question ""Gender"" is a MCQ with options ""1. Male 2. Female"".
   - Therefore, respondent '107' is male.

2. **Find all respondents who are male and have a 'Life satisfaction' score greater than 5:**
   - We will iterate through each respondent and check their gender and 'Life satisfaction' score.
   - Respondents who are male have an answer for the ""Gender"" question with a value of ""1.0"".
   - For 'Life satisfaction', we are looking for scores greater than 5.

Let's examine the respondents:

- **Respondent '41':** Gender = ""2.0"" (Female), Life satisfaction = ""8.0"". Does not match because the gender is female.
- **Respondent '113':** Gender = ""2.0"" (Female), Life satisfaction = ""7.0"". Does not match because the gender is female.
- **Respondent '107':** Gender = ""1.0"" (Male), Life satisfaction = ""6.0"". Matches both conditions.
- **Respondent '124':** Gender = ""1.0"" (Male), Life satisfaction = ""7.0"". Matches both conditions.
- **Respondent '119':** Gender = ""2.0"" (Female), Life satisfaction = ""8.0"". Does not match because the gender is female.
- **Respondent '53':** Gender = ""2.0"" (Female), Life satisfaction = ""5.0"". Does not match because the life satisfaction score is not greater than 5 and the gender is female.
- **Respondent '88':** Gender = ""1.0"" (Male), Life satisfaction = ""7.0"". Matches both conditions.
- **Respondent '37':** Gender = ""2.0"" (Female), Life satisfaction = ""8.0"". Does not match because the gender is female.

**Respondents who match the criteria:** '107', '124', '88'.

Therefore, the respondents who are the same gender as respondent '107' (male) and also have a 'Life satisfaction' score greater than 5 are '107', '124', '88'.",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondents are the same gender as respondent '28' and also have a 'Life satisfaction' score greater than 6?
</task>","To answer this question, we first need to identify the gender of respondent '28' and then find all respondents who share the same gender and have a 'Life satisfaction' score greater than 6.

According to the data, respondent '28' has the following answer for 'Gender':
<answer question=""Gender"">1.0</answer>

Referring to the 'questions' section, the 'Gender' question is defined as:
<question id=""Gender"">What is your gender? [MCQ: 1. Male 2. Female]</question>

So, respondent '28' is male.

Next, we need to find all male respondents with a 'Life satisfaction' score greater than 6.

Here are the male respondents with their 'Life satisfaction' scores:
- Respondent '82' is female.
- Respondent '89' is male with a 'Life satisfaction' score of 9.0.
- Respondent '103' is female.
- Respondent '34' is male with a 'Life satisfaction' score of 10.0.
- Respondent '95' is male with a 'Life satisfaction' score of 8.0.
- Respondent '132' is female.
- Respondent '144' is female.
- Respondent '28' is male with a 'Life satisfaction' score of 7.0.
- Respondent '62' is female.
- Respondent '120' is male with a 'Life satisfaction' score of 6.0.

From the above list, the male respondents with a 'Life satisfaction' score greater than 6 are:
89, 34, 95, 28

These respondents meet both conditions: they are the same gender as respondent '28' (male) and have a 'Life satisfaction' score greater than 6.",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondents are the same gender as respondent '75' and also have a 'Life satisfaction' score greater than 6?
</task>","To answer this question, we first need to identify the gender of respondent '75' and then find all respondents who share this gender and have a 'Life satisfaction' score greater than 6.

1. **Identify the gender of respondent '75':** 
   - Respondent '75' has an answer for the question ""Gender"" with a value of ""1.0"".
   - According to the 'questions' schema, the question ""Gender"" is an MCQ with options ""1. Male"" and ""2. Female"".
   - Therefore, respondent '75' is male.

2. **Find all respondents who are male and have a 'Life satisfaction' score greater than 6:**
   - We will iterate through each respondent's answers to find those with a ""Gender"" answer of ""1.0"" (male) and a ""Life satisfaction"" score greater than 6.

Respondents and their relevant answers:
- **69:** Gender = ""1.0"" (Male), Life satisfaction = ""4.0"" (Does not meet the criteria)
- **116:** Gender = ""1.0"" (Male), Life satisfaction = ""6.0"" (Does not meet the criteria because it's not greater than 6)
- **64:** Gender = ""2.0"" (Female), Life satisfaction = ""7.0"" (Does not meet the gender criteria)
- **37:** Gender = ""2.0"" (Female), Life satisfaction = ""8.0"" (Does not meet the gender criteria)
- **25:** Gender = ""2.0"" (Female), Life satisfaction = ""8.0"" (Does not meet the gender criteria)
- **13:** Gender = ""1.0"" (Male), Life satisfaction = ""7.0"" (Meets the criteria)
- **75:** Gender = ""1.0"" (Male), Life satisfaction = ""8.0"" (Meets the criteria)
- **99:** Gender = ""1.0"" (Male), Life satisfaction = ""5.0"" (Does not meet the criteria)

**Respondents who meet the criteria:** 13, 75",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Find all respondents who were born in the same year as respondent '6' and have a 'Happiness' score of 5 or more.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to find the year of birth of respondent '6' and then identify all respondents who were born in that year and have a 'Happiness' score of 5 or more.

1. **Find the year of birth of respondent '6':**
   - Looking at the 'responses' section for respondent '6', we find the answer to the ""Year of birth"" question is ""2006.0"".

2. **Identify all respondents born in 2006 and with a 'Happiness' score of 5 or more:**
   - We now need to scan through all respondents to find those who match two criteria:
     - Born in 2006.
     - Have a 'Happiness' score of 5 or more.
   - From the provided data, only respondent '6' is born in 2006, and their 'Happiness' score is exactly 5.0, which meets the criteria.

Therefore, the respondent who was born in the same year as respondent '6' and has a 'Happiness' score of 5 or more is respondent '6' itself.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
List all respondents who have the same 'Socio-economic status' as respondent '101' and report a 'Stress' score of less than 3.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to understand the 'Socio-economic status' of respondent '101' and then find all respondents who share this status and have a 'Stress' score of less than 3.

1. **Determine the 'Socio-economic status' of respondent '101':**
   - Looking at the responses for respondent '101', we find that their 'Socio-economic status' is **6.0**.

2. **Identify all respondents with the same 'Socio-economic status' (6.0) and a 'Stress' score of less than 3:**
   - We need to scan through all respondents and find those whose 'Socio-economic status' is **6.0** and whose 'Stress' score is less than **3**.
   - Respondents with 'Socio-economic status' of **6.0** are '101', '130', and '13'.
   - Now, we check the 'Stress' score for each of these respondents:
     - Respondent '101' has a 'Stress' score of **3.0**, which does not meet the criteria.
     - Respondent '130' has a 'Stress' score of **2.0**, which meets the criteria.
     - Respondent '13' has a 'Stress' score of **2.0**, which meets the criteria.

Therefore, the respondents who have the same 'Socio-economic status' as respondent '101' (which is **6.0**, corresponding to ""Very high"") and report a 'Stress' score of less than 3 are **130** and **13**.",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
List all respondents who have the same 'Socio-economic status' as respondent '127' and report a 'Stress' score of less than 4.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to understand the 'Socio-economic status' of respondent '127' and then find all respondents who have the same status and report a 'Stress' score of less than 4.

1. **Determine the 'Socio-economic status' of respondent '127':**
   - Looking at the responses for respondent '127', we find that their 'Socio-economic status' is 4.0.

2. **Identify all respondents with the same 'Socio-economic status':**
   - We need to find all respondents who also have a 'Socio-economic status' of 4.0.
   - Respondents '73', '127', '121', and '111' all have a 'Socio-economic status' of 4.0.

3. **Filter by 'Stress' score less than 4:**
   - Now, we filter these respondents to only include those who reported a 'Stress' score of less than 4.
   - Respondent '73' has a 'Stress' score of 4.0, which does not meet the criteria.
   - Respondent '127' has a 'Stress' score of 2.0, which meets the criteria.
   - Respondent '121' has a 'Stress' score of 4.0, which does not meet the criteria.
   - Respondent '111' has a 'Stress' score of 2.0, which meets the criteria.

Therefore, the respondents who have the same 'Socio-economic status' as respondent '127' and report a 'Stress' score of less than 4 are '127' and '111'.",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'Happiness' score is higher than the average 'Happiness' for all respondents born in the same year as respondent '50'.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to find the year of birth of respondent '50' and then calculate the average 'Happiness' score for all respondents born in that year. Afterward, we will identify respondents with a 'Happiness' score higher than this average.

1. **Find the year of birth of respondent '50':**
   - Respondent '50' was born in 2003.

2. **Calculate the average 'Happiness' score for respondents born in 2003:**
   - Respondents born in 2003 are '50'.
   - The 'Happiness' score for respondent '50' is 10.
   - Since there's only one respondent born in 2003, the average 'Happiness' score is 10.

3. **Identify respondents with a 'Happiness' score higher than the average:**
   - Since the average 'Happiness' score for those born in 2003 is 10, we are looking for respondents with a 'Happiness' score higher than 10.
   - However, given that the maximum score for 'Happiness' is 10, there are no respondents with a score higher than 10.

Therefore, there are no respondents whose 'Happiness' score is higher than the average 'Happiness' for all respondents born in the same year as respondent '50'.",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'Happiness' score is higher than the average 'Happiness' for all respondents born in the same year as respondent '116'.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to find the year of birth of respondent '116' and then calculate the average 'Happiness' score for all respondents born in that year. Afterward, we will identify respondents whose 'Happiness' score is higher than this average.

1. **Find the year of birth of respondent '116':**
   - Respondent '116' was born in 2002.

2. **Calculate the average 'Happiness' score for all respondents born in 2002:**
   - Respondents born in 2002 are: 74, 116, 130, 72, and 31.
   - Their 'Happiness' scores are: 3.0, 6.0, 8.0, 7.0, and 6.0 respectively.
   - Average 'Happiness' = (3.0 + 6.0 + 8.0 + 7.0 + 6.0) / 5 = 30.0 / 5 = 6.0

3. **Identify respondents whose 'Happiness' score is higher than the average 'Happiness' for those born in 2002 (which is 6.0):**
   - From the list of respondents born in 2002 (74, 116, 130, 72, 31), those with 'Happiness' scores higher than 6.0 are: 130 (8.0), 72 (7.0).
   - Additionally, we need to check all other respondents to see if any have a 'Happiness' score higher than 6.0, regardless of their birth year.
   - Other respondents with 'Happiness' scores higher than 6.0 are: 142 (5.0 - does not qualify), 19 (6.0 - does not qualify because it's not higher than 6.0), 99 (2.0 - does not qualify), 141 (6.0 - does not qualify), 31 (6.0 - does not qualify), 33 (4.0 - does not qualify).

The final answer is: $\boxed{72, 130}$",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Which respondents have a total 'Anxiety Symptoms' score that is lower than the average total 'Depressive Symptoms' score for all respondents of the same gender?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the total 'Anxiety Symptoms' score and the total 'Depressive Symptoms' score for each respondent. Then, we calculate the average total 'Depressive Symptoms' score for all respondents of the same gender. Finally, we compare the total 'Anxiety Symptoms' score of each respondent with the average total 'Depressive Symptoms' score of their respective gender and list the respondents whose 'Anxiety Symptoms' score is lower.

Here are the steps in detail:

1. Calculate the total 'Anxiety Symptoms' score for each respondent:
   - Respondent 101: 2 + 2 + 1 + 0 + 3 = 8
   - Respondent 96: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 6
   - Respondent 87: 2 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 5
   - Respondent 143: 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 8
   - Respondent 94: 3 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 3
   - Respondent 37: 3 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 11
   - Respondent 51: 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 7
   - Respondent 131: 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 9

2. Calculate the total 'Depressive Symptoms' score for each respondent:
   - Respondent 101: 2 + 2 + 2 + 0 + 2 + 0 + 0 = 8
   - Respondent 96: 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 1
   - Respondent 87: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 6
   - Respondent 143: 2 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 11
   - Respondent 94: 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 1
   - Respondent 37: 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 4
   - Respondent 51: 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 0 = 9
   - Respondent 131: 2 + 3 + 2 + 0 + 2 + 0 + 0 = 9

3. Calculate the average total 'Depressive Symptoms' score for each gender:
   - Male respondents: 96 (1), 87 (6), 143 (11)
     Average for males = (1 + 6 + 11) / 3 = 18 / 3 = 6
   - Female respondents: 101 (8), 94 (1), 37 (4), 51 (9), 131 (9)
     Average for females = (8 + 1 + 4 + 9 + 9) / 5 = 31 / 5 = 6.2

4. Compare the total 'Anxiety Symptoms' score of each respondent with the average total 'Depressive Symptoms' score of their respective gender:
   - Respondent 101 (Female): 8 < 6.2 (No)
   - Respondent 96 (Male): 6 < 6 (No)
   - Respondent 87 (Male): 5 < 6 (Yes)
   - Respondent 143 (Male): 8 < 6 (No)
   - Respondent 94 (Female): 3 < 6.2 (Yes)
   - Respondent 37 (Female): 11 < 6.2 (No)
   - Respondent 51 (Female): 7 < 6.2 (Yes)
   - Respondent 131 (Female): 9 < 6.2 (No)

The respondents with a total 'Anxiety Symptoms' score lower than the average total 'Depressive Symptoms' score for all respondents of the same gender are:

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'Happiness' score is higher than the average 'Happiness' for all respondents born in the same year as respondent '133'.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to find the year of birth of respondent '133' and then calculate the average 'Happiness' score for all respondents born in that year. Afterward, we will identify respondents whose 'Happiness' score is higher than this average.

1. **Find the year of birth of respondent '133':**
   - Respondent '133' was born in 2002.

2. **Calculate the average 'Happiness' score for all respondents born in 2002:**
   - Respondents born in 2002 are '10', '133'.
   - '10' has a 'Happiness' score of 10.0.
   - '133' has a 'Happiness' score of 6.0.
   - Average 'Happiness' = (10.0 + 6.0) / 2 = 8.0.

3. **Identify respondents whose 'Happiness' score is higher than the average 'Happiness' for those born in 2002 (which is 8.0):**
   - We need to check each respondent's 'Happiness' score and year of birth to find those with a score higher than 8.0 and born in 2002.
   - From the data:
     - '10' (born in 2002) has a 'Happiness' score of 10.0, which is higher than 8.0.
     - '133' (born in 2002) has a 'Happiness' score of 6.0, which is not higher than 8.0.
     - Other respondents born in different years or with lower 'Happiness' scores are not included.

Given the task's requirements, the only respondent whose 'Happiness' score is higher than the average 'Happiness' for all respondents born in the same year as respondent '133' (2002) is:

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'Happiness' score is higher than the average 'Happiness' for all respondents born in the same year as respondent '130'.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to find the year of birth of respondent '130' and then calculate the average 'Happiness' score for all respondents born in that year. Afterward, we will identify respondents with a 'Happiness' score higher than this average.

1. **Find the year of birth of respondent '130':**
   - Respondent '130' was born in 2002.

2. **Calculate the average 'Happiness' score for all respondents born in 2002:**
   - Respondents born in 2002 are: 84, 82, 77, and 130.
   - Their 'Happiness' scores are: 8.0, 6.0, 7.0, and 8.0 respectively.
   - Average 'Happiness' = (8.0 + 6.0 + 7.0 + 8.0) / 4 = 29.0 / 4 = 7.25.

3. **Identify respondents with a 'Happiness' score higher than 7.25:**
   - We need to check all respondents' 'Happiness' scores and compare them to 7.25.
   - Respondents with 'Happiness' scores higher than 7.25 are those with scores of 8.0 or more, based on the provided data.

Respondents with a 'Happiness' score higher than the average are:
- Respondent '84' with a score of 8.0.
- Respondent '87' with a score of 8.0.
- Respondent '130' with a score of 8.0.

Thus, the respondents whose 'Happiness' score is higher than the average 'Happiness' for all respondents born in the same year as respondent '130' are 84, 87, 130.",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
List all respondents who have more years of father's education than the average mother's education for all respondents with the same 'Socio-economic status'.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average mother's education for all respondents with the same 'Socio-economic status' as each respondent, and then compare it with the years of father's education for each respondent.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
List all respondents who have more years of father's education than the average mother's education for all respondents with the same 'Socio-economic status'.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average mother's education for each socio-economic status group. Then, we compare each respondent's father's education to this average within their respective socio-economic status group.

Given the data, we will follow these steps:

1. Calculate the average mother's education for each socio-economic status.
2. Identify respondents with more years of father's education than the average mother's education within their socio-economic status group.

Let's start by calculating the average mother's education for each socio-economic status:

- Socio-economic status 2: 
  - Respondent 59: Mother's education = 9.0
  - Respondent 44: Mother's education = 17.0
  Average = (9.0 + 17.0) / 2 = 13.0

- Socio-economic status 3: 
  - Respondent 122: Mother's education = 16.0
  - Respondent 148: No mother's education data
  - Respondent 14: No mother's education data
  - Respondent 98: No mother's education data
  Since we only have data for respondent 122, we cannot accurately calculate an average for this group without assuming missing data is not relevant or using a different method to handle missing data. For the purpose of this exercise, we'll proceed with the available data but keep in mind this limitation.

- Socio-economic status 4: 
  - Respondent 149: Mother's education = 16.0
  - Respondent 135: Mother's education = 11.0
  - Respondent 38: Mother's education = 24.0
  Average = (16.0 + 11.0 + 24.0) / 3 = 17.0

- Socio-economic status 5: 
  - Respondent 150: No mother's education data
  - Respondent 123: Mother's education = 18.0
  Since we only have data for respondent 123, similar to socio-economic status 3, we cannot accurately calculate an average without making assumptions about missing data.

- Socio-economic status 6: 
  - Respondent 68: Mother's education = 20.0
  Since there's only one respondent in this category with mother's education data, we cannot calculate an average in the traditional sense.

Given these calculations and the limitations due to missing data, let's proceed to identify respondents with more years of father's education than the average mother's education within their socio-economic status group, keeping in mind the averages calculated and the missing data issues:

- Socio-economic status 2: Average mother's education = 13.0
  - Respondent 59: Father's education = 12.0 (less than the average)
  - Respondent 44: Father's education = 17.0 (more than the average)

- Socio-economic status 3: Given the missing data and the inability to accurately calculate an average, we cannot make direct comparisons for this group based on the provided data.

- Socio-economic status 4: Average mother's education = 17.0
  - Respondent 149: Father's education = 18.0 (more than the average)
  - Respondent 135: Father's education = 10.0 (less than the average)
  - Respondent 38: Father's education = 22.0 (more than the average)

- Socio-economic status 5 and 6: Due to the lack of sufficient data to calculate averages, we cannot make comparisons for these groups.

Based on the available data and the calculations above, the respondents with more years of father's education than the average mother's education within their socio-economic status group are:

44, 149, 38

These respondents have more years of father's education compared to the calculated average mother's education within their respective socio-economic status groups, based on the data provided and the method of calculation used.",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'Happiness' score is higher than the average 'Happiness' for all respondents born in the same year as respondent '81'.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to find the year of birth of respondent '81' and then calculate the average 'Happiness' score for all respondents born in that year. Afterward, we will identify respondents with a 'Happiness' score higher than this average.

1. **Find the year of birth of respondent '81':**
   - Respondent '81' was born in 2002.

2. **Calculate the average 'Happiness' score for all respondents born in 2002:**
   - Respondents born in 2002 are: 9, 81, 113.
   - Their 'Happiness' scores are: 8.0 (9), 6.0 (81), 8.0 (113).
   - Average 'Happiness' = (8.0 + 6.0 + 8.0) / 3 = 22.0 / 3 = 7.33.

3. **Identify respondents with a 'Happiness' score higher than 7.33:**
   - We need to check all respondents' 'Happiness' scores and compare them to 7.33.
   - Respondents and their 'Happiness' scores are:
     - 9: 8.0
     - 147: 9.0
     - 29: 6.0
     - 49: 0.0
     - 5: 4.0
     - 113: 8.0
     - 81: 6.0
     - 108: 2.0
     - 39: 8.0
   - Respondents with 'Happiness' scores higher than 7.33 are: 9, 147, 113, 39.

Therefore, the respondents whose 'Happiness' score is higher than the average 'Happiness' for all respondents born in the same year as respondent '81' are **9, 147, 113, 39**.",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
List all respondents who have more years of father's education than the average mother's education for all respondents with the same 'Socio-economic status'.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average mother's education for each socio-economic status group. Then, we compare each respondent's father's education to this average, but only for respondents within the same socio-economic status group. We list those who have more years of father's education than this average.

Given the complexity and the specific requirements of the task, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate Average Mother's Education by Socio-economic Status**:
   - For each unique socio-economic status, calculate the average of the mother's education years.

2. **Compare Father's Education to Average Mother's Education**:
   - For each respondent, compare their father's education years to the average mother's education years of their respective socio-economic status group.
   - Identify respondents where the father's education years are more than the average mother's education years.

Let's execute these steps with the provided data:

### Step 1: Calculate Average Mother's Education by Socio-economic Status

- **Socio-economic status = 1.0**:
  - Respondent 133: Mother's education = (No data)
  - Since there's only one respondent with socio-economic status 1.0 and no mother's education data, we cannot calculate an average.

- **Socio-economic status = 2.0**:
  - Respondent 53: Mother's education = 5.0
  - Respondent 16: Mother's education = (No data)
  - Average = 5.0 (since only one has data)

- **Socio-economic status = 3.0**:
  - Respondent 36: Mother's education = (No data)
  - Respondent 54: Mother's education = (Only Father's data)
  - Respondent 84: Mother's education = 16.0
  - Respondent 144: Mother's education = 4.0
  - Average = (16.0 + 4.0) / 2 = 10.0

- **Socio-economic status = 4.0**:
  - Respondent 106: Mother's education = 17.0
  - Respondent 121: Mother's education = 20.0
  - Average = (17.0 + 20.0) / 2 = 18.5

- **Socio-economic status = 5.0**:
  - Respondent 129: Mother's education = (No data)
  - Respondent 123: Mother's education = 18.0
  - Average = 18.0 (since only one has data)

### Step 2: Compare Father's Education to Average Mother's Education

- **Socio-economic status = 1.0**:
  - Respondent 133: Father's education = (No data), cannot compare.

- **Socio-economic status = 2.0**:
  - Respondent 53: Father's education = 3.0, Average Mother's = 5.0, Not more.
  - Respondent 16: Father's education = (No data), cannot compare.

- **Socio-economic status = 3.0**:

Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Find all respondents whose 'Happiness' score is higher than the average 'Happiness' for all respondents born in the same year as respondent '68'.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to find the year of birth of respondent '68' and then calculate the average 'Happiness' score for all respondents born in that year. Afterward, we will identify respondents with a 'Happiness' score higher than this average.

1. **Find the year of birth of respondent '68':**
   - Respondent '68' was born in 2004.

2. **Calculate the average 'Happiness' score for all respondents born in 2004:**
   - Respondent '68' has a 'Happiness' score of 5.0.
   - There are no other respondents born in 2004, so the average 'Happiness' score for 2004 is 5.0.

3. **Identify respondents with a 'Happiness' score higher than the average (5.0) for the year 2004:**
   - Since the average 'Happiness' score for respondents born in 2004 is 5.0, we look for respondents with a 'Happiness' score higher than 5.0.

Given the data, the respondents with a 'Happiness' score higher than 5.0 are:
- Respondent '97' with a score of 5.0 does not qualify because their score is not higher than 5.0.
- Respondent '81' with a score of 6.0 qualifies.
- Respondent '45' with a score of 9.0 qualifies.
- Respondent '118' with a score of 5.0 does not qualify.
- Respondent '137' with a score of 7.0 qualifies.
- Respondent '88' with a score of 5.0 does not qualify.
- Respondent '140' with a score of 5.0 does not qualify.
- Respondent '91' with a score of 7.0 qualifies.
- Respondent '124' with a score of 7.0 qualifies.
- Respondent '50' with a score of 10.0 qualifies.
- Respondent '64' with a score of 9.0 qualifies.

Therefore, the respondents whose 'Happiness' score is higher than the average 'Happiness' for all respondents born in the same year as respondent '68' (2004) are:
81, 45, 137, 91, 124, 50, 64.",False
