</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who are male.
</task>","To count the respondents who are male, we need to look at the ""Gender"" field in the responses section. According to the questions schema, the ""Gender"" field is a multiple-choice question with options ""1. Male"" and ""2. Female"". We are interested in counting the respondents who selected option ""1. Male"".

Looking at the responses, we can see that the following respondents have a ""Gender"" value of 1.0, which corresponds to ""Male"":

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents with a 'Life satisfaction' of 5 or higher.
</task>","To accurately count the respondents with a 'Life satisfaction' of 5 or higher, we need to examine each respondent's data in the 'responses' section and compare their 'Life_satisfaction' score.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who are male.
</task>","To count the respondents who are male, we need to look at the ""Gender"" field in the responses. According to the questionnaire schema, the ""Gender"" field is a multiple-choice question with options ""1. Male"" and ""2. Female"". 

We will go through each respondent's data and count those with a ""Gender"" value of ""1.0"", which corresponds to ""Male"".

From the provided data:
- Respondent14: Gender = 2.0 (Female)
- Respondent26: Gender = 2.0 (Female)
- Respondent106: Gender = 1.0 (Male)
- Respondent85: Gender = 1.0 (Male)
- Respondent121: Gender = 1.0 (Male)
- Respondent36: Gender = 2.0 (Female)
- Respondent2: Gender = 2.0 (Female)
- Respondent141: Gender = 2.0 (Female)

Therefore, the respondents who are male are Respondent106, Respondent85, and Respondent121.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents with a 'Loneliness' of 2 or lower.
</task>","To answer this question, we need to examine the 'responses' section of the data and look for respondents where the 'Loneliness' score is 2 or lower.

From the data provided:

- Respondent105 has a 'Loneliness' score of 10.0, which is higher than 2.
- Respondent122 has a 'Loneliness' score of 5.0, which is higher than 2.
- Respondent123 has a 'Loneliness' score of 0.0, which is 2 or lower.
- Respondent52 has a 'Loneliness' score of 0.0, which is 2 or lower.
- Respondent74 has a 'Loneliness' score of 10.0, which is higher than 2.
- Respondent83 has a 'Loneliness' score of 10.0, which is higher than 2.
- Respondent16 has a 'Loneliness' score of 4.0, which is higher than 2.

However, upon re-examining the task, it's clear that the instruction is to count respondents with a 'Loneliness' score of 2 or lower. Thus, the correct count should include:

- Respondent123 with a score of 0.0
- Respondent52 with a score of 0.0
- Respondent16 with a score of 4.0 does not meet the criteria since 4 is higher than 2, but upon reviewing the initial assessment, it was incorrectly considered. The correct assessment should note that scores of 0 and those exactly at or below 2 should be counted. Since 4 is indeed higher than 2, it should not be included.

Correcting the oversight and following the instruction precisely:

Respondents with a 'Loneliness' score of 2 or lower are Respondent123 and Respondent52, and any others that might have been missed due to the incorrect interpretation of the task.

Upon a detailed review:
- Respondent105 does not qualify.
- Respondent122 does not qualify because the score is 5, which is higher than 2.
- Respondent123 qualifies with a score of 0.
- Respondent52 qualifies with a score of 0.
- Respondent74 does not qualify.
- Respondent83 does not qualify.
- Respondent16 does not qualify because the score is 4, which is higher than 2.

Thus, the correct count of respondents with a 'Loneliness' score of 2 or lower, based on the provided data and correcting for the precise criteria, includes only those with scores of 0 or exactly 2, which means:

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents born after 2003.
</task>","To determine the number of respondents born after 2003, we need to examine the 'Year_of_birth' data for each respondent in the 'responses' section.

From the provided data:
- Respondent130 was born in 2002.
- Respondent120 was born in 2002.
- Respondent70 was born in 2004.
- Respondent50 was born in 2003.
- Respondent29 was born in 2004.
- Respondent85 was born in 2003.
- Respondent42 was born in 2005.

Thus, the respondents born after 2003 are:
- Respondent70 (born in 2004)
- Respondent29 (born in 2004)
- Respondent42 (born in 2005)

Counting these respondents gives us a total of 3 respondents born after 2003, but we must also consider Respondent50 and Respondent85 who were born exactly in 2003. Since the task asks for respondents born ""after"" 2003, these two are not included in the count.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents born before 2005.
</task>","To determine the number of respondents born before 2005, we need to examine the 'Year_of_birth' data for each respondent.

From the provided data:
- Respondent103 was born in 2002.
- Respondent25 was born in 2001.
- Respondent48 was born in 1999.
- Respondent36 was born in 2003.
- Respondent123 was born in 1999.
- Respondent83 was born in 2004.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who are male.
</task>","To count the respondents who are male, we need to look at the ""Gender"" field in the responses section. According to the questions schema, the ""Gender"" field is a multiple-choice question with options ""1. Male"" and ""2. Female"". We are interested in counting the respondents who selected option ""1. Male"".

Looking at the responses, we can see that the following respondents have a ""Gender"" value of 1.0, which corresponds to ""Male"":

* Respondent104
* Respondent129
* Respondent80
* Respondent57
* Respondent95
* Respondent40

There are 5 respondents who are male, and also Respondent76 and Respondent123 and Respondent35 are not, but Respondent31 and Respondent123 and Respondent40 and Respondent57 and Respondent95 and Respondent104 and Respondent129 and Respondent80 are, so the total count of male respondents is 5.",False

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents born after 2002.
</task>","To determine the number of respondents born after 2002, we need to examine the 'Year_of_birth' data for each respondent.

From the provided data:

- Respondent96 was born in 2005.
- Respondent107 was born in 2001.
- Respondent141 was born in 2004.
- Respondent121 was born in 2005.
- Respondent138 was born in 2005.
- Respondent56 was born in 2003.
- Respondent64 was born in 2005.
- Respondent21 was born in 2003.
- Respondent135 was born in 1993.
- Respondent115 was born in 2004.
- Respondent136 was born in 2005.
- Respondent93 was born in 2003.

Counting the respondents born after 2002:
- 2003: Respondent56, Respondent21, Respondent93
- 2004: Respondent141, Respondent115
- 2005: Respondent96, Respondent121, Respondent138, Respondent64, Respondent136

There are 3 respondents from 2003, 2 from 2004, and 5 from 2005, making a total of 3 + 2 + 5 = 10 respondents born after 2002.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who are male.
</task>","To count the respondents who are male, we need to look at the ""Gender"" field in the responses section. According to the questions schema, the ""Gender"" field is a multiple-choice question with options ""1. Male"" and ""2. Female"". We are interested in counting the respondents who selected option ""1. Male"".

Looking at the responses, we can see that the following respondents have a ""Gender"" value of 1.0, which corresponds to ""Male"":

* Respondent84
* Respondent114
* Respondent30
* Respondent150

Therefore, the count of respondents who are male is 4, but since the question asks for the count and the output should follow specific rules, we should directly provide the number without any additional text.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who are male.
</task>","To count the respondents who are male, we need to look at the ""Gender"" field in the responses. According to the questionnaire schema, the ""Gender"" field is a multiple-choice question with options ""1. Male"" and ""2. Female"". We are interested in counting the respondents who selected ""1. Male"".

Looking through the responses:

- Respondent15 has a Gender of 1.0, which corresponds to ""Male"".
- Respondent117 has a Gender of 1.0, which corresponds to ""Male"".
- Respondent34 has a Gender of 1.0, which corresponds to ""Male"".
- Respondent107 has a Gender of 1.0, which corresponds to ""Male"".

There are 5 respondents who are male.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents born after 2002.
</task>","To determine the number of respondents born after 2002, we need to examine the 'Year_of_birth' data for each respondent.

From the provided data:

- Respondent96 was born in 2005.
- Respondent98 was born in 2003.
- Respondent115 was born in 2004.
- Respondent97 was born in 2002.
- Respondent21 was born in 2003.
- Respondent139 was born in 2002.
- Respondent35 was born in 2001.
- Respondent90 was born in 2002.
- Respondent31 was born in 2002.
- Respondent46 was born in 2002.
- Respondent138 was born in 2005.

Thus, the respondents born after 2002 are:
- Respondent96 (2005)
- Respondent98 (2003)
- Respondent115 (2004)
- Respondent21 (2003)
- Respondent138 (2005)

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents born before 2005.
</task>","To determine the number of respondents born before 2005, we need to examine the 'Year_of_birth' data for each respondent.

From the provided data:

- Respondent136 was born in 2005.
- Respondent33 was born in 2004.
- Respondent58 was born in 2004.
- Respondent1 was born in 2003.
- Respondent6 was born in 2006.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Depression' and 'Happiness' is exactly 10.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to identify the respondents whose total score for 'Depression' and 'Happiness' equals exactly 10.

From the questionnaire, we understand that:
- 'Depression' is measured on a scale of 0-10, where 0 = ""At no time"" and 10 = ""All the time"".
- 'Happiness' is also measured on a scale of 0-10, where 0 = ""At no time"" and 10 = ""All the time"".

We will go through each respondent's data and calculate the total score for 'Depression' and 'Happiness'. We are looking for respondents where this total equals 10.

Let's examine the responses:

1. Respondent5: Depression = 0, Happiness = 4. Total = 4.
2. Respondent62: Depression = 3, Happiness = 6. Total = 9.
3. Respondent53: Depression = 2, Happiness = 5. Total = 7.
4. Respondent18: Depression = 2, Happiness = 4. Total = 6.
5. Respondent26: Depression = 2, Happiness = 4. Total = 6.
6. Respondent9: Depression = 1, Happiness = 8. Total = 9.
7. Respondent115: Depression = 1, Happiness = 4. Total = 5.
8. Respondent13: Depression = 1, Happiness = 6. Total = 7.
9. Respondent63: Depression = 0, Happiness = 8. Total = 8.
10. Respondent12: Depression = 0, Happiness = 9. Total = 9.
11. Respondent103: Depression = 0, Happiness = 7. Total = 7.

None of the respondents have a total score of exactly 10 for 'Depression' and 'Happiness'.

The final answer is: $\boxed{0}$",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the male respondents whose mother has more than 10 years of education and whose 'Life satisfaction' is 7 or higher.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the male respondents.
2. Determine which of these males have a mother with more than 10 years of education.
3. Filter this group further to include only those with a 'Life satisfaction' score of 7 or higher.

From the provided data:

- Male respondents are those with `pred:Gender 1.0`.
- The education level of the mother is found in the `:RespondentXXX_Parental_Education` sections, specifically the `pred:Mother` value.
- 'Life satisfaction' scores are found in the main respondent sections, `pred:Life_satisfaction`.

Let's analyze the data:

1. **Male Respondents**: 
   - Respondent57 (`pred:Gender 1.0`)
   - Respondent106 (`pred:Gender 1.0`)
   - Respondent77 (`pred:Gender 1.0`)
   - Respondent16 (`pred:Gender 1.0`)
   - Respondent143 (`pred:Gender 1.0`)

2. **Mother's Education > 10 years**:
   - Respondent57 does not have mother's education data.
   - Respondent106 has mother's education as 17 years (`pred:Mother 17.0`).
   - Respondent77 does not have mother's education data.
   - Respondent16 does not have mother's education data.
   - Respondent143 does not have mother's education data.

3. **Life Satisfaction >= 7**:
   - Respondent57 has a life satisfaction of 8.0.
   - Respondent106 has a life satisfaction of 5.0.
   - Respondent77 has a life satisfaction of 7.0.
   - Respondent16 has a life satisfaction of 9.0.
   - Respondent143 has a life satisfaction of 8.0.

Combining these criteria:
- Only Respondent106 has data for all criteria but does not meet the life satisfaction threshold.
- Respondent57 meets the life satisfaction criterion but lacks mother's education data.
- Respondent77 meets the gender and life satisfaction criteria but lacks mother's education data.
- Respondent16 meets the gender and life satisfaction criteria but lacks mother's education data.
- Respondent143 meets the gender and life satisfaction criteria but lacks mother's education data.

However, upon re-evaluation for strict adherence to the format and accurate interpretation of the task:

- The actual task requires counting males whose mothers have more than 10 years of education **and** have a life satisfaction of 7 or higher. 
- Only Respondent106 explicitly meets the mother's education criterion with 17 years, but fails to meet the life satisfaction threshold of 7 or higher.
- None of the other male respondents have their mother's education level specified, so they cannot be counted based on the provided data.

Given the strict criteria and the provided data, **none** of the male respondents can be confirmed to have a mother with more than 10 years of education **and** a life satisfaction of 7 or higher, based on the explicit data given. 

The final answer is: $\boxed{0}$",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Depression' and 'Worry' is exactly 15.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to examine each respondent's scores for 'Depression' and 'Worry' and count those whose total score for these two questions is exactly 15.

From the provided data:

1. **Respondent110**: Depression = 0, Worry = 1. Total = 1.
2. **Respondent143**: Depression = 2, Worry = 1. Total = 3.
3. **Respondent127**: Depression = 0, Worry = 1. Total = 1.
4. **Respondent13**: Depression = 1, Worry = 0. Total = 1.
5. **Respondent89**: Depression = 0, Worry = 2. Total = 2.
6. **Respondent98**: Depression = 0, Worry = 1. Total = 1.
7. **Respondent135**: Depression = 0, Worry = 1. Total = 1.

None of the respondents have a total score of exactly 15 for 'Depression' and 'Worry'.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the male respondents whose mother has more than 10 years of education and whose 'Life satisfaction' is 6 or higher.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the male respondents.
2. Filter those whose mother has more than 10 years of education.
3. Further filter those with 'Life satisfaction' of 6 or higher.

From the 'questions' section, we understand that:
- Gender is coded as 1 for Male and 2 for Female.
- 'Life satisfaction' is a direct score.
- Parental education years are given in the `:RespondentXXX_Parental_Education` sections.

Let's analyze the 'responses' section based on these criteria:

1. **Male Respondents**: 
   - Respondent107 (Gender: 1.0)
   - Respondent105 (Gender: 1.0)
   - Respondent39 (Gender: 1.0)
   - Respondent77 (Gender: 1.0)
   - Respondent97 (Gender: 1.0)
   - Respondent138 (Gender: 1.0)
   - Respondent58 (Gender: 1.0)

2. **Mother's Education More Than 10 Years**:
   - Respondent107 (Mother: 6.0) - Does not meet the criteria.
   - Respondent105 (Mother: 11.0) - Meets the criteria.
   - Respondent39 - No mother's education specified.
   - Respondent77 - No parental education specified.
   - Respondent97 - No parental education specified.
   - Respondent138 (Mother: 12.0) - Meets the criteria.
   - Respondent58 - No mother's education specified, but since the task requires the mother to have more than 10 years of education and Respondent58's mother is not specified, we cannot include Respondent58.

3. **'Life Satisfaction' of 6 or Higher**:
   - Respondent105 (Life satisfaction: 7.0) - Meets the criteria.
   - Respondent138 (Life satisfaction: 6.0) - Meets the criteria.

Therefore, the male respondents whose mother has more than 10 years of education and whose 'Life satisfaction' is 6 or higher are Respondent105 and Respondent138.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents born in 2004 who have a 'Stress' greater than 5 and a 'Depression' less than 3.
</task>","To answer this question, we need to analyze the 'responses' section of the data and identify the respondents who meet the specified criteria.

From the 'questions' section, we know that 'QStress' and 'QDepression' are the predicates for 'Stress' and 'Depression', respectively. We also know that 'QYear_of_birth' is the predicate for the year of birth.

Looking at the 'responses' section, we can see that there are two respondents born in 2004: Respondent37 and Respondent144.

Respondent37 has a 'Stress' value of 3.0, which is less than 5, so they do not meet the criteria.

Respondent144 has a 'Stress' value of 4.0, which is also less than 5, so they do not meet the criteria.

However, neither of these respondents meet the 'Stress' criteria. But, we should also verify the 'Depression' criteria for completeness, even though the 'Stress' condition is not met.

Respondent37 has a 'Depression' value of 1.0, which is less than 3.

Respondent144 has a 'Depression' value of 2.0, which is also less than 3.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Life satisfaction' and 'Happiness' is exactly 15.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to examine each respondent's scores for 'Life satisfaction' and 'Happiness' and count those whose total score for these two questions is exactly 15.

From the provided data:

1. **Respondent69**: Life satisfaction = 4, Happiness = 2. Total = 6.
2. **Respondent97**: Life satisfaction = 6, Happiness = 5. Total = 11.
3. **Respondent11**: Life satisfaction = 8, Happiness = 5. Total = 13.
4. **Respondent19**: Life satisfaction = 7, Happiness = 6. Total = 13.
5. **Respondent49**: Life satisfaction = 2, Happiness = 0. Total = 2.
6. **Respondent144**: Life satisfaction = 5, Happiness = 7. Total = 12.
7. **Respondent56**: Life satisfaction = 7, Happiness = 5. Total = 12.
8. **Respondent123**: Life satisfaction = 8, Happiness = 6. Total = 14.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Loneliness' and 'Happiness' is exactly 10.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to examine each respondent's scores for 'Loneliness' and 'Happiness' and count those whose total score for these two questions is exactly 10.

From the provided data:

1. **Respondent86**: Loneliness = 10, Happiness = 5; Total = 15
2. **Respondent78**: Loneliness = 0, Happiness = 7; Total = 7
3. **Respondent4**: Loneliness = 0, Happiness = 9; Total = 9
4. **Respondent55**: Loneliness = 0, Happiness = 8; Total = 8
5. **Respondent49**: Loneliness = 9, Happiness = 0; Total = 9
6. **Respondent31**: Loneliness = 5, Happiness = 6; Total = 11
7. **Respondent123**: Loneliness = 0, Happiness = 6; Total = 6
8. **Respondent63**: Loneliness = 0, Happiness = 8; Total = 8
9. **Respondent53**: Loneliness = 10, Happiness = 5; Total = 15

None of the respondents have a total score of exactly 10 for 'Loneliness' and 'Happiness'.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents born in 2004 who have a 'Loneliness' greater than 6 and a 'Depression' less than 3.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to analyze the 'responses' section of the data and identify respondents who meet the specified criteria: born in 2004, 'Loneliness' greater than 6, and 'Depression' less than 3.

1. **Identify respondents born in 2004**: 
   - Respondent26: Year_of_birth = 2004
   - Respondent53: Year_of_birth = 2004
   - Respondent57: Year_of_birth = 2004
   - Respondent12: Year_of_birth = 2004
   - Respondent81: Year_of_birth = 2002 (does not meet the criteria)
   - Respondent145: Year_of_birth = 2022 (does not meet the criteria)
   - Other respondents either do not meet the year of birth criteria or are not relevant to this specific question.

2. **Filter by 'Loneliness' greater than 6**:
   - Respondent26: Loneliness = 3 (does not meet the criteria)
   - Respondent53: Loneliness = 10 (meets the criteria)
   - Respondent57: Loneliness = 0 (does not meet the criteria)
   - Respondent12: Loneliness = 0 (does not meet the criteria)

3. **Filter by 'Depression' less than 3**:
   - Respondent53: Depression = 2 (meets the criteria)

From the analysis, only Respondent53 meets all the specified criteria.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Depression' and 'Stress' is exactly 20.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to examine each respondent's scores for 'Depression' and 'Stress', add these two scores together, and then count how many respondents have a total score of exactly 20.

From the provided data:

1. Respondent5: Depression = 0, Stress = 3. Total = 3.
2. Respondent67: Depression = 0, Stress = 3. Total = 3.
3. Respondent142: Depression = 2, Stress = 4. Total = 6.
4. Respondent150: Depression = 3, Stress = 3. Total = 6.
5. Respondent149: Depression = 1, Stress = 2. Total = 3.
6. Respondent107: Depression = 1, Stress = 3. Total = 4.
7. Respondent76: Depression = 2, Stress = 2. Total = 4.
8. Respondent40: Depression = 3, Stress = 4. Total = 7.
9. Respondent51: Depression = 1, Stress = 3. Total = 4.

None of the respondents have a total score of exactly 20 for 'Depression' and 'Stress'.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the female respondents whose mother has more than 10 years of education and whose 'Life satisfaction' is 7 or higher.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the female respondents.
2. Determine which of these females have a mother with more than 10 years of education.
3. Filter those whose 'Life satisfaction' is 7 or higher.

From the questionnaire, we know:
- Gender is coded as 1 for Male and 2 for Female.
- The question about the mother's education is part of the `:QGParental_Education` group, specifically `:QParental_Education_Mother`.
- 'Life satisfaction' is measured by `:QLife_satisfaction`.

Let's analyze the responses:

1. **Female Respondents**: 
   - Respondent59: Female
   - Respondent98: Female
   - Respondent146: Female
   - Respondent141: Female
   - Respondent118: Female

2. **Mother's Education > 10 years**:
   - Respondent59: Mother's education = 9.0 years (does not meet the criteria)
   - Respondent98: No parental education data provided
   - Respondent146: Mother's education = 9.0 years (does not meet the criteria)
   - Respondent141: No parental education data provided
   - Respondent118: Mother's education = 11.0 years (meets the criteria)

3. **Life Satisfaction >= 7**:
   - Respondent118: Life satisfaction = 6.0 (does not meet the criteria)

Upon reviewing the provided data again for accuracy in filtering based on the criteria:

- Respondent63: Female, Mother's education = 21.0 years, Life satisfaction = 8.0 (meets all criteria)
- Respondent128: Female, Mother's education = 12.0 years, Life satisfaction = 8.0 (meets all criteria)
- Respondent87: Female, No parental education data provided
- Respondent66: Female, Mother's education = 15.0 years, Life satisfaction = 8.0 (meets all criteria)
- Respondent126: Female, No parental education data provided

Thus, the female respondents whose mother has more than 10 years of education and whose 'Life satisfaction' is 7 or higher are:
- Respondent63
- Respondent128
- Respondent66

Count of such respondents: 3",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the female respondents whose mother has more than 12 years of education and whose 'Life satisfaction' is 8 or higher.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the female respondents.
2. Filter those whose mother has more than 12 years of education.
3. Among them, count those with 'Life satisfaction' of 8 or higher.

From the provided data:

- Female respondents are those with `pred:Gender 2.0`.
- The education of the mother is given under `:RespondentXX_Parental_Education pred:Mother XX.0`.
- 'Life satisfaction' scores are given under `pred:Life_satisfaction XX.0`.

Let's analyze the data:

1. **Female Respondents**: 
   - Respondent2 (`pred:Gender 2.0`), 
   - Respondent36 (`pred:Gender 2.0`).

2. **Mother's Education More Than 12 Years**:
   - Respondent2's mother has 11 years of education (`:Respondent2_Parental_Education pred:Mother 11.0`), which does not meet the criteria.
   - Respondent36 does not have detailed parental education data provided in the snippet, so we cannot assess this respondent based on the given data.

However, upon closer inspection of the data provided, there seems to be an oversight in the initial analysis regarding the availability of detailed parental education data for all respondents, particularly for Respondent36. Given the strict format and the data provided, we should focus on the respondents for whom we have complete information.

Since the detailed education data for Respondent36's parents is not fully provided in the question snippet (only the year of birth, gender, socio-economic status, and ethnic identity are mentioned without the specific parental education details), and considering the strict instructions to base the analysis solely on the provided data, we must proceed with the information available.

Given this, the correct approach is to identify female respondents with the specified criteria based on the detailed data provided for each respondent. However, due to the missing detailed parental education data for some respondents like Respondent36, and the fact that Respondent2's mother does not meet the education criterion, we need to carefully review the data again for any other female respondents that might have been overlooked.

Upon reevaluation:
- Respondent60 is a male (`pred:Gender 1.0`), so not applicable.
- The other respondents (Respondent20, Respondent13, Respondent106, Respondent18, Respondent39) are males based on their gender coding (`pred:Gender 1.0`).

For the females identified (Respondent2 and Respondent36), we lack sufficient data to fully apply the criteria to Respondent36, and Respondent2 does not meet the mother's education criterion.

Thus, based on the provided data and adhering strictly to the format and instructions, we find that there are no female respondents who meet all the specified criteria (mother having more than 12 years of education and 'Life satisfaction' of 8 or higher) for whom we have complete and applicable data.

The final answer is: $\boxed{0}$",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose combined 'Depression' and 'Stress' score is lower than the average combined 'Depression' and 'Stress' score for their gender.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average combined 'Depression' and 'Stress' score for each gender. Then, we compare each respondent's combined score to the average for their gender and count those whose score is lower.

1. **Calculate the average combined 'Depression' and 'Stress' score for each gender:**

- For males (Gender = 1), the respondents are: Respondent130, Respondent117, Respondent96, Respondent16, Respondent124, Respondent125.
  - Respondent130: Depression = 0, Stress = 2, Combined = 2
  - Respondent117: Depression = 0, Stress = 3, Combined = 3
  - Respondent96: Depression = 0, Stress = 3, Combined = 3
  - Respondent16: Depression = 0, Stress = 1, Combined = 1
  - Respondent124: Depression = 0, Stress = 2, Combined = 2
  - Respondent125: Depression = 1, Stress = 2, Combined = 3
  - Average for males = (2 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 3) / 6 = 14 / 6 = 2.33

- For females (Gender = 2), the respondents are: Respondent56, Respondent5.
  - Respondent56: Depression = 1, Stress = 4, Combined = 5
  - Respondent5: Depression = 0, Stress = 3, Combined = 3
  - Average for females = (5 + 3) / 2 = 8 / 2 = 4

2. **Compare each respondent's score to the average for their gender and count those whose score is lower:**

- Males:
  - Respondent130: 2 < 2.33, Count
  - Respondent117: 3 > 2.33, No count
  - Respondent96: 3 > 2.33, No count
  - Respondent16: 1 < 2.33, Count
  - Respondent124: 2 < 2.33, Count
  - Respondent125: 3 > 2.33, No count
  - Male count = 3

- Females:
  - Respondent56: 5 > 4, No count
  - Respondent5: 3 < 4, Count
  - Female count = 1

3. **Total count of respondents whose combined 'Depression' and 'Stress' score is lower than the average for their gender:**

Total count = Male count + Female count = 3 + 1 = 4

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the respondents whose 'Worry' is higher than the average 'Worry' for their gender.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Worry' score for each gender and then compare each respondent's 'Worry' score to the average for their respective gender.

From the questionnaire, we understand that:
- Gender is coded as 1 for Male and 2 for Female.
- 'Worry' is scored on a Likert scale of 0–10.

Let's calculate the average 'Worry' score for each gender:

### Male Respondents
- Respondent137: Worry = 1
- Respondent106: Worry = 3
- Respondent4: Worry = 0
- Respondent138: Worry = 1

Total Worry for Males = 1 + 3 + 0 + 1 = 5  
Number of Male Respondents = 4  
Average Worry for Males = Total Worry for Males / Number of Male Respondents = 5 / 4 = 1.25

### Female Respondents
- Respondent142: Worry = 3
- Respondent5: Worry = 2
- Respondent136: Worry = 1
- Respondent71: Worry = 1

Total Worry for Females = 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 7  
Number of Female Respondents = 4  
Average Worry for Females = Total Worry for Females / Number of Female Respondents = 7 / 4 = 1.75

Now, let's identify respondents whose 'Worry' score is higher than the average for their gender:

### Males
- Respondent137: Worry = 1 (not higher than 1.25)
- Respondent106: Worry = 3 (higher than 1.25)
- Respondent4: Worry = 0 (not higher than 1.25)
- Respondent138: Worry = 1 (not higher than 1.25)

### Females
- Respondent142: Worry = 3 (higher than 1.75)
- Respondent5: Worry = 2 (not higher than 1.75)
- Respondent136: Worry = 1 (not higher than 1.75)
- Respondent71: Worry = 1 (not higher than 1.75)

Respondents with 'Worry' higher than the average for their gender are:
- Respondent106 (Male)
- Respondent142 (Female)

Count of such respondents = 2

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$",True

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the respondents whose 'Stress' is higher than the average 'Stress' for their gender.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Stress' for each gender and then count the respondents whose 'Stress' is higher than the average 'Stress' for their respective gender.

From the questionnaire, we know that:
- Gender is coded as 1 for Male and 2 for Female.
- Stress is measured on a scale of 0-10.

Let's calculate the average Stress for each gender:

### Male Respondents (Gender = 1)
1. Respondent129: Stress = 3
2. Respondent111: Stress = 2
3. Respondent28: Stress = 1
4. Respondent135: Stress = 3
5. Respondent39: Stress = 1

Average Stress for Males = (3 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 1) / 5 = 10 / 5 = 2

### Female Respondents (Gender = 2)
1. Respondent5: Stress = 3
2. Respondent46: Stress = 4
3. Respondent25: Stress = 1
4. Respondent62: Stress = 4
5. Respondent50: Stress = 3

Average Stress for Females = (3 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 3) / 5 = 15 / 5 = 3

Now, let's count the respondents whose 'Stress' is higher than the average 'Stress' for their gender:

### Males with Stress higher than average (2):
1. Respondent129: Stress = 3 (higher than 2)
2. Respondent135: Stress = 3 (higher than 2)

### Females with Stress higher than average (3):
1. Respondent46: Stress = 4 (higher than 3)
2. Respondent62: Stress = 4 (higher than 3)

Count of respondents whose 'Stress' is higher than the average 'Stress' for their gender = 2 (Males) + 2 (Females) = 4

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$",True
case_44,respondent_count,Count the respondents who were born in a year where the average 'Life satisfaction' for that year was greater than the overall average 'Life satisfaction'.,"@prefix : <http://example.org/survey#> .

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who were born in a year where the average 'Life satisfaction' for that year was greater than the overall average 'Life satisfaction'.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the overall average 'Life satisfaction' across all respondents. Then, for each year of birth, we calculate the average 'Life satisfaction' and compare it to the overall average. Finally, we count the respondents born in years where the average 'Life satisfaction' for that year exceeds the overall average.

1. **Calculate Overall Average 'Life satisfaction':**
   - Sum of 'Life satisfaction' for all respondents = 10.0 + 8.0 + 8.0 + 4.0 + 7.0 + 5.0 + 10.0 + 8.0 + 6.0 + 8.0 + 7.0 + 10.0 + 8.0 + 6.0 + 8.0 + 7.0 + 9.0 + 5.0 + 10.0 + 8.0 = 152
   - Number of respondents = 20
   - Overall average 'Life satisfaction' = 152 / 20 = 7.6

2. **Calculate Average 'Life satisfaction' by Year of Birth and Compare:**
   - **2002:** Respondents 102, 104; Life satisfaction = 7.0 + 8.0 = 15; Average = 15 / 2 = 7.5 (Less than overall average)
   - **2003:** Respondents 21, 69; Life satisfaction = 5.0 + 4.0 = 9; Average = 9 / 2 = 4.5 (Less than overall average)
   - **2004:** Respondents 58, 63; Life satisfaction = 7.0 + 8.0 = 15; Average = 15 / 2 = 7.5 (Less than overall average)
   - **2005:** Respondents 65, 91, 96, 118; Life satisfaction = 8.0 + 8.0 + 10.0 + 6.0 = 32; Average = 32 / 4 = 8 (Greater than overall average)
   - **1993:** Respondent 135; Life satisfaction = 10.0; Average = 10.0 (Greater than overall average)
   - **2022:** Respondent 145; Life satisfaction = 8.0; Average = 8.0 (Greater than overall average)

3. **Count Respondents Born in Years with Average 'Life satisfaction' Greater than Overall Average:**
   - **2005:** 4 respondents (65, 91, 96, 118)
   - **1993:** 1 respondent (135)
   - **2022:** 1 respondent (145)

Total respondents = 4 (2005) + 1 (1993) + 1 (2022) = 6

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who were born in a year where the average 'Life satisfaction' for that year was greater than the overall average 'Life satisfaction'.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the overall average 'Life satisfaction' across all respondents. Then, we calculate the average 'Life satisfaction' for each year of birth. Finally, we count the respondents born in years where the average 'Life satisfaction' for that year exceeds the overall average.

### Step 1: Calculate Overall Average 'Life satisfaction'

To find the overall average, we sum up all 'Life satisfaction' scores and divide by the total number of respondents.

Respondents and their 'Life satisfaction' scores:
- Respondent21: 5.0
- Respondent9: 6.0
- Respondent24: 8.0
- Respondent104: 8.0
- Respondent98: 6.0
- Respondent97: 6.0
- Respondent142: 7.0
- Respondent122: 7.0
- Respondent15: 7.0
- Respondent3: 6.0

Sum of 'Life satisfaction' = 5.0 + 6.0 + 8.0 + 8.0 + 6.0 + 6.0 + 7.0 + 7.0 + 7.0 + 6.0 = 66.0

Total number of respondents = 10

Overall average 'Life satisfaction' = Sum of 'Life satisfaction' / Total number of respondents = 66.0 / 10 = 6.6

### Step 2: Calculate Average 'Life satisfaction' by Year of Birth

Years of birth and corresponding 'Life satisfaction' scores:
- 2002: Respondent9 (6.0), Respondent104 (8.0), Respondent97 (6.0), Respondent15 (7.0)
- 2003: Respondent21 (5.0), Respondent98 (6.0)
- 2004: Respondent24 (8.0), Respondent142 (7.0)
- 2005: Respondent122 (7.0)
- 1998: Respondent3 (6.0)

Average for 2002 = (6.0 + 8.0 + 6.0 + 7.0) / 4 = 27.0 / 4 = 6.75
Average for 2003 = (5.0 + 6.0) / 2 = 11.0 / 2 = 5.5
Average for 2004 = (8.0 + 7.0) / 2 = 15.0 / 2 = 7.5
Average for 2005 = 7.0 / 1 = 7.0
Average for 1998 = 6.0 / 1 = 6.0

### Step 3: Identify Years with Average 'Life satisfaction' Greater Than Overall Average

Overall average 'Life satisfaction' is 6.6. Years with average greater than 6.6 are:
- 2002 (6.75)
- 2004 (7.5)
- 2005 (7.0)

### Step 4: Count Respondents Born in Identified Years

Respondents born in these years:
- 2002: Respondent9, Respondent104, Respondent97, Respondent15
- 2004: Respondent24, Respondent142
- 2005: Respondent122

Total respondents = 4 (from 2002) + 2 (from 2004) + 1 (from 2005) = 7

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$",True
case_46,respondent_count,Count the respondents whose combined 'Worry' and 'Life satisfaction' score is lower than the average combined 'Worry' and 'Life satisfaction' score for their gender.,"@prefix : <http://example.org/survey#> .

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose combined 'Worry' and 'Life satisfaction' score is lower than the average combined 'Worry' and 'Life satisfaction' score for their gender.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average combined 'Worry' and 'Life satisfaction' score for each gender. Then, we compare each respondent's score to the average of their respective gender and count those whose score is lower.

1. **Calculate the average combined 'Worry' and 'Life satisfaction' score for each gender:**

- Male respondents have a 'Gender' value of 1.0.
- Female respondents have a 'Gender' value of 2.0.

Let's calculate the sum of 'Worry' and 'Life satisfaction' for each gender and then find the average.

**Male Respondents:**
- Respondent22: Worry (2.0) + Life satisfaction (6.0) = 8.0
- Respondent128: Worry (1.0) + Life satisfaction (8.0) = 9.0
- Respondent112: Worry (1.0) + Life satisfaction (5.0) = 6.0
- Respondent85: Worry (1.0) + Life satisfaction (7.0) = 8.0
- Respondent11: Worry (0.0) + Life satisfaction (8.0) = 8.0

Sum for Male = 8.0 + 9.0 + 6.0 + 8.0 + 8.0 = 39.0
Number of Male respondents = 5
Average for Male = 39.0 / 5 = 7.8

**Female Respondents:**
- Respondent145: Worry (2.0) + Life satisfaction (8.0) = 10.0
- Respondent25: Worry (1.0) + Life satisfaction (8.0) = 9.0
- Respondent136: Worry (1.0) + Life satisfaction (6.0) = 7.0
- Respondent59: Worry (1.0) + Life satisfaction (4.0) = 5.0

Sum for Female = 10.0 + 9.0 + 7.0 + 5.0 = 31.0
Number of Female respondents = 4
Average for Female = 31.0 / 4 = 7.75

2. **Compare each respondent's score to the average of their respective gender and count those whose score is lower:**

**Male Respondents:**
- Respondent22: 8.0 (not lower than 7.8)
- Respondent128: 9.0 (not lower than 7.8)
- Respondent112: 6.0 (lower than 7.8)
- Respondent85: 8.0 (not lower than 7.8)
- Respondent11: 8.0 (not lower than 7.8)

**Female Respondents:**
- Respondent145: 10.0 (not lower than 7.75)
- Respondent25: 9.0 (not lower than 7.75)
- Respondent136: 7.0 (lower than 7.75)
- Respondent59: 5.0 (lower than 7.75)

Count of respondents whose combined score is lower than the average for their gender = 3

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who were born in a year where the average 'Life satisfaction' for that year was greater than the overall average 'Life satisfaction'.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the overall average 'Life satisfaction' across all respondents. Then, for each year of birth, we calculate the average 'Life satisfaction' and compare it to the overall average. Finally, we count the respondents born in years where the average 'Life satisfaction' was greater than the overall average.

1. **Calculate overall average 'Life satisfaction':**

From the provided data, we sum up all 'Life satisfaction' scores and divide by the total number of respondents.

- Respondent146: 7.0
- Respondent122: 7.0
- Respondent70: 8.0
- Respondent12: 6.0
- Respondent20: 9.0
- Respondent72: 6.0
- Respondent140: 3.0
- Respondent145: 8.0
- Respondent9: 6.0

Total 'Life satisfaction' = 7.0 + 7.0 + 8.0 + 6.0 + 9.0 + 6.0 + 3.0 + 8.0 + 6.0 = 60.0

Total respondents = 9

Overall average 'Life satisfaction' = Total 'Life satisfaction' / Total respondents = 60.0 / 9 ≈ 6.67

2. **Calculate average 'Life satisfaction' for each year of birth and compare:**

- **2001:** Respondent140 = 3.0 (Average = 3.0)
- **2002:** Respondent72 = 6.0, Respondent9 = 6.0 (Average = (6.0 + 6.0) / 2 = 6.0)
- **2003:** Respondent20 = 9.0 (Average = 9.0)
- **2004:** Respondent12 = 6.0, Respondent70 = 8.0 (Average = (6.0 + 8.0) / 2 = 7.0)
- **2005:** Respondent146 = 7.0, Respondent122 = 7.0 (Average = (7.0 + 7.0) / 2 = 7.0)
- **2022:** Respondent145 = 8.0 (Average = 8.0)

Years with average 'Life satisfaction' greater than the overall average (6.67):
- 2003 (9.0)
- 2004 (7.0)
- 2005 (7.0)
- 2022 (8.0)

Respondents in these years:
- Respondent20 (2003)
- Respondent12 (2004)
- Respondent70 (2004)
- Respondent146 (2005)
- Respondent122 (2005)
- Respondent145 (2022)

Count of respondents = 6

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the respondents whose total 'Depressive Symptoms' score is higher than the average for their 'Socio-economic status' group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Depressive Symptoms' score for each 'Socio-economic status' group. Then, we compare each respondent's 'Depressive Symptoms' score to the average of their respective 'Socio-economic status' group and count those whose score is higher.

1. **Calculate the total 'Depressive Symptoms' score for each respondent**: This involves summing up the scores for each of the depressive symptoms (Anhedonia, Depressed Mood, Sleep Problems, Fatigue, Appetite Changes, Feelings of Worthlessness, Concentration Difficulties, Psychomotor Changes, Suicidal Thoughts).

2. **Determine the 'Socio-economic status' group for each respondent**: This is directly given in the responses.

3. **Calculate the average 'Depressive Symptoms' score for each 'Socio-economic status' group**: Sum up all the 'Depressive Symptoms' scores for respondents in each 'Socio-economic status' group and divide by the number of respondents in that group.

4. **Compare each respondent's 'Depressive Symptoms' score to the average of their 'Socio-economic status' group**: Count the respondents whose score is higher than the average.

Given the complexity and the amount of data, let's simplify the process with the provided data:

- Respondents and their 'Depressive Symptoms' scores are as follows (calculated by summing the individual symptoms' scores):
  - Respondent81: 3+3+3+1+1+0+0+1 = 14
  - Respondent5: 1+0+0+0+3+0+0+0 = 4
  - Respondent54: 2+2+3+3+1+1+0+0 = 12
  - Respondent37: 1+0+1+1+0+1+0+0 = 4
  - Respondent102: 0+1+0+1+0+0+0+0 = 2
  - Respondent20: 0+1+0+0+0+0+0+0 = 1
  - Respondent77: 1+1+1+0+1+0+0+0 = 4
  - Respondent42: 3+3+3+0+0+0+0+0 = 9
  - Respondent145: 1+2+1+1+1+1+0+0 = 7

- 'Socio-economic status' groups and their respective average 'Depressive Symptoms' scores:
  - Status 3: (14 + 12 + 7) / 3 = 33 / 3 = 11
  - Status 5: (4 + 2 + 9) / 3 = 15 / 3 = 5
  - Status 6: (4 + 1 + 4) / 3 = 9 / 3 = 3

Now, comparing each respondent's score to their group's average:
- Status 3: Respondent81 (14), Respondent54 (12), Respondent145 (7). None are higher than the average of 11.
- Status 5: Respondent37 (4), Respondent102 (2), Respondent42 (9). Respondent42 is higher than the average of 5.
- Status 6: Respondent5 (4), Respondent20 (1), Respondent77 (4). None are higher than the average of 3.

Thus, only Respondent42 has a 'Depressive Symptoms' score higher than the average for their 'Socio-economic status' group.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose combined 'Life satisfaction' and 'Depression' score is lower than the average combined 'Life satisfaction' and 'Depression' score for their gender.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average combined 'Life satisfaction' and 'Depression' score for each gender. Then, we compare each respondent's score to the average of their respective gender and count those whose score is lower.

1. **Calculate the average combined score for each gender:**

- For males (Gender = 1.0), we sum 'Life satisfaction' and 'Depression' scores and then divide by the number of males.
- For females (Gender = 2.0), we do the same.

2. **Identify respondents whose combined score is lower than their gender's average:**

- Compare each respondent's combined score to the average of their gender.
- Count the respondents who meet the condition.

**Step 1: Calculate averages**

Males:
- Respondent100: Life satisfaction = 8.0, Depression = 1.0, Combined = 9.0
- Respondent85: Life satisfaction = 7.0, Depression = 0.0, Combined = 7.0
- Respondent99: Life satisfaction = 5.0, Depression = 1.0, Combined = 6.0
- Respondent129: Life satisfaction = 7.0, Depression = 1.0, Combined = 8.0
- Respondent89: Life satisfaction = 9.0, Depression = 0.0, Combined = 9.0

Total combined score for males = 9.0 + 7.0 + 6.0 + 8.0 + 9.0 = 39.0
Number of males = 5
Average for males = 39.0 / 5 = 7.8

Females:
- Respondent146: Life satisfaction = 7.0, Depression = 2.0, Combined = 9.0
- Respondent139: Life satisfaction = 6.0, Depression = 3.0, Combined = 9.0
- Respondent36: Life satisfaction = 7.0, Depression = 0.0, Combined = 7.0
- Respondent21: Life satisfaction = 5.0, Depression = 3.0, Combined = 8.0

Total combined score for females = 9.0 + 9.0 + 7.0 + 8.0 = 33.0
Number of females = 4
Average for females = 33.0 / 4 = 8.25

**Step 2: Identify and count respondents**

Males:
- Respondent100: 9.0 (not lower than 7.8)
- Respondent85: 7.0 (lower than 7.8)
- Respondent99: 6.0 (lower than 7.8)
- Respondent129: 8.0 (lower than 7.8)
- Respondent89: 9.0 (not lower than 7.8)

Females:
- Respondent146: 9.0 (not lower than 8.25)
- Respondent139: 9.0 (not lower than 8.25)
- Respondent36: 7.0 (lower than 8.25)
- Respondent21: 8.0 (lower than 8.25)

**Count:**
- Males: 3 (Respondent85, Respondent99, Respondent129)
- Females: 2 (Respondent36, Respondent21)

Total count = 3 + 2 = 5

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the respondents who were born in a year where the average 'Life satisfaction' for that year was greater than the overall average 'Life satisfaction'.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the overall average 'Life satisfaction' across all respondents. Then, we calculate the average 'Life satisfaction' for each year of birth. Finally, we count the respondents born in years where the average 'Life satisfaction' for that year exceeds the overall average.

1. **Calculate Overall Average 'Life satisfaction':**

   - Respondent26: 4.0
   - Respondent112: 5.0
   - Respondent60: 8.0
   - Respondent20: 9.0
   - Respondent88: 7.0
   - Respondent102: 7.0
   - Respondent84: 9.0
   - Respondent8: 8.0

   Overall average = (4.0 + 5.0 + 8.0 + 9.0 + 7.0 + 7.0 + 9.0 + 8.0) / 8 = 58.0 / 8 = 7.25

2. **Calculate Average 'Life satisfaction' by Year of Birth:**

   - 2000: Respondent60 = 8.0
   - 2001: Respondent112 = 5.0, Respondent88 = 7.0; Average = (5.0 + 7.0) / 2 = 6.0
   - 2002: Respondent102 = 7.0, Respondent84 = 9.0; Average = (7.0 + 9.0) / 2 = 8.0
   - 2003: Respondent20 = 9.0, Respondent8 = 8.0; Average = (9.0 + 8.0) / 2 = 8.5
   - 2004: Respondent26 = 4.0

3. **Identify Years with Average 'Life satisfaction' Greater than Overall Average (7.25):**

   - 2000: 8.0 > 7.25
   - 2002: 8.0 > 7.25
   - 2003: 8.5 > 7.25

4. **Count Respondents Born in These Years:**

   - 2000: Respondent60 (1)
   - 2002: Respondent102, Respondent84 (2)
   - 2003: Respondent20, Respondent8 (2)

Total count = 1 (2000) + 2 (2002) + 2 (2003) = 5

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$",True
