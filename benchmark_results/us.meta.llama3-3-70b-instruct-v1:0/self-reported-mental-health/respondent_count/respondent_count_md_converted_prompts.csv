</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who are male.
</task>","To count the respondents who are male, we need to look at the ""Gender"" field in the responses. According to the schema, the ""Gender"" field is a multiple-choice question with options ""1. Male"" and ""2. Female"". We will count the number of respondents who have selected option ""1.0"" (which corresponds to ""Male"").


Respondent 74: Male
Respondent 32: Male
Respondent 102: Male
Respondent 89: Male
Respondent 38: Male
Respondent 75: Male

There are 7 respondents who are male, but since Respondent 147, 140, and 98 are not male, and there are only 8 respondents in total in the given data, the correct count based on the provided data is 7 males out of the 8 respondents listed (as Respondent 147, 140, and 98 are female). However, the instruction was to count the males, and based on the explicit data given:

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who are male.
</task>","To count the respondents who are male, we need to look at the ""Gender"" field in the responses. According to the schema, the gender options are ""[MCQ: 1. Male 2. Female]"". We will count the number of respondents who have a ""Gender"" value of ""1.0"", which corresponds to ""Male"".

From the responses:
- Respondent 106: Gender = 1.0 (Male)
- Respondent 85: Gender = 1.0 (Male)
- Respondent 121: Gender = 1.0 (Male)

There are 4 respondents with a gender value of ""1.0"", which means they are male.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who are female.
</task>","To count the respondents who are female, we need to look at the ""Gender"" field in the responses. According to the schema, the gender options are ""[MCQ: 1. Male 2. Female]"". 

We will go through each respondent's answer for the ""Gender"" field and count those who answered ""2.0"", which corresponds to ""Female"".

Respondent 2: 2.0 (Female)
Respondent 67: 2.0 (Female)
Respondent 99: 1.0 (Male)
Respondent 61: 1.0 (Male)
Respondent 115: 2.0 (Female)

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who are male.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who are female.
</task>","To count the respondents who are female, we need to look at the ""Gender"" field in the responses. According to the schema, the gender options are ""[MCQ: 1. Male 2. Female]"".

- Respondent 16: 1.0 (Male)
- Respondent 141: 2.0 (Female)
- Respondent 130: 1.0 (Male)

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who are male.
</task>","To count the respondents who are male, we need to look at the ""Gender"" field in the responses. According to the schema, the ""Gender"" field is a multiple-choice question with options ""1. Male"" and ""2. Female"". We are interested in counting the respondents who selected ""1. Male"".

Looking through the responses:

- Respondent 15: Gender = 1.0 (Male)
- Respondent 117: Gender = 1.0 (Male)
- Respondent 34: Gender = 1.0 (Male)
- Respondent 107: Gender = 1.0 (Male)

There are 4 respondents who are male, but we need to check all responses to ensure accuracy.

After reviewing all the responses, we find additional males:
- None other than those already listed have a Gender value of 1.0.

Thus, the total count of male respondents is 5.",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who are female.
</task>","To count the respondents who are female, we need to look at the ""Gender"" field in the responses. According to the schema, the gender options are ""[MCQ: 1. Male 2. Female]"".

- Respondent 12: 1.0 (Male)
- Respondent 109: 1.0 (Male)
- Respondent 89: 1.0 (Male)
- Respondent 17: 2.0 (Female)
- Respondent 139: 2.0 (Female)

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Depression' and 'Happiness' is exactly 10.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to examine each respondent's data for 'Depression' and 'Happiness' scores, add these two scores together, and then count how many respondents have a total score of exactly 10.

Let's go through the respondents one by one:

1. Respondent 5: Depression = 0, Happiness = 4. Total = 4.
2. Respondent 62: Depression = 3, Happiness = 6. Total = 9.
3. Respondent 53: Depression = 2, Happiness = 5. Total = 7.
4. Respondent 18: Depression = 2, Happiness = 4. Total = 6.
5. Respondent 26: Depression = 2, Happiness = 4. Total = 6.
6. Respondent 9: Depression = 1, Happiness = 8. Total = 9.
7. Respondent 115: Depression = 1, Happiness = 4. Total = 5.
8. Respondent 13: Depression = 1, Happiness = 6. Total = 7.
9. Respondent 63: Depression = 0, Happiness = 8. Total = 8.
10. Respondent 12: Depression = 0, Happiness = 9. Total = 9.
11. Respondent 103: Depression = 0, Happiness = 7. Total = 7.

None of the respondents have a total score of exactly 10 for 'Depression' and 'Happiness'.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the male respondents whose mother has more than 10 years of education and whose 'Life satisfaction' is 7 or higher.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify male respondents.
2. Filter those whose mother has more than 10 years of education.
3. Among them, count those with 'Life satisfaction' of 7 or higher.

Given data:

- Respondent 134: Female, no parental education data.
- Respondent 57: Male, Father's education = 3 years, no mother's education data.
- Respondent 106: Male, Both parents' education = 17 years, Life satisfaction = 5.
- Respondent 77: Male, no parental education data, Life satisfaction = 7.
- Respondent 71: Female, no parental education data.
- Respondent 16: Male, no parental education data, Life satisfaction = 9.
- Respondent 143: Male, no parental education data, Life satisfaction = 8.

From the given data, only Respondent 106 has both parents' education data, and it's more than 10 years. However, the life satisfaction is 5, which does not meet the criteria of 7 or higher.

Respondents 77 and 16 are male with life satisfaction 7 or higher but lack data on their mother's education.

Since we cannot infer the mother's education for most respondents and the only respondent with sufficient parental education data (Respondent 106) does not meet the life satisfaction criterion, we cannot accurately count the male respondents who meet all specified conditions based on the provided data.

However, strictly following the task and the data given, we find that there are no respondents who meet all the criteria (being male, having a mother with more than 10 years of education, and having a life satisfaction of 7 or higher) because we lack sufficient data on parental education for most respondents.

The final answer is: $\boxed{0}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents born in 2004 who have a 'Stress' greater than 5 and a 'Depression' less than 3.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to carefully examine the 'responses' section of the data provided and apply the filters as specified in the task.

1. **Filter by Year of Birth**: We are only interested in respondents born in 2004. So, we look for respondents with a 'Year of birth' value of 2004.0.

2. **Filter by Stress Level**: We need respondents with a 'Stress' level greater than 5.

3. **Filter by Depression Level**: We are looking for respondents with a 'Depression' level less than 3.

Let's apply these filters to the provided data:

- Respondent 37: Born in 2004, Stress = 3.0, Depression = 1.0. Does not meet the Stress criterion.
- Respondent 144: Born in 2004, Stress = 4.0, Depression = 2.0. Does not meet the Stress criterion.

Given the data, there are no respondents born in 2004 with a Stress level greater than 5 and a Depression level less than 3.

The final answer is: $\boxed{0}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

- **Happiness:** 2.0
Total = 4.0 + 2.0 = 6.0

### Respondent 97
- **Life satisfaction:** 6.0
- **Happiness:** 5.0
Total = 6.0 + 5.0 = 11.0

### Respondent 11
- **Life satisfaction:** 8.0
- **Happiness:** 5.0
Total = 8.0 + 5.0 = 13.0

### Respondent 19
- **Life satisfaction:** 7.0
- **Happiness:** 6.0
Total = 7.0 + 6.0 = 13.0

### Respondent 49
- **Life satisfaction:** 2.0
- **Happiness:** 0.0
Total = 2.0 + 0.0 = 2.0

### Respondent 144
- **Life satisfaction:** 5.0
- **Happiness:** 7.0
Total = 5.0 + 7.0 = 12.0

### Respondent 56
- **Life satisfaction:** 7.0
- **Happiness:** 5.0
Total = 7.0 + 5.0 = 12.0

### Respondent 123
- **Life satisfaction:** 8.0

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents born in 2004 who have a 'Loneliness' greater than 6 and a 'Depression' less than 3.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to carefully examine the 'responses' section of the data provided and apply the filters as specified in the task.

1. **Filter by Year of Birth**: We are only interested in respondents born in 2004. So, we look for respondents with a 'Year of birth' value of 2004.0.

2. **Filter by Loneliness**: The 'Loneliness' score must be greater than 6. This means we are looking for respondents with a 'Loneliness' value of 7 or more.

3. **Filter by Depression**: The 'Depression' score must be less than 3. This means we are looking for respondents with a 'Depression' value of 2 or less.

Let's apply these filters to the provided data:

- Respondent 26: Born in 2004, 'Loneliness' is 3.0 (which is less than 6), and 'Depression' is 2.0. This respondent does not meet the 'Loneliness' criterion.
- Respondent 53: Born in 2004, 'Loneliness' is 10.0 (which is greater than 6), and 'Depression' is 2.0. This respondent meets all criteria.
- Respondent 57: Born in 2004, 'Loneliness' is 0.0 (which is less than 6), and 'Depression' is 0.0. This respondent does not meet the 'Loneliness' criterion.
- Respondent 81: Born in 2002, so this respondent does not meet the 'Year of birth' criterion.
- Respondent 82: Born in 2002, so this respondent does not meet the 'Year of birth' criterion.
- Respondent 95: Born in 2006, so this respondent does not meet the 'Year of birth' criterion.
- Respondent 106: Born in 2002, so this respondent does not meet the 'Year of birth' criterion.
- Respondent 12: Born in 2004, 'Loneliness' is 0.0 (which is less than 6), and 'Depression' is 0.0. This respondent does not meet the 'Loneliness' criterion.
- Respondent 120: Born in 2002, so this respondent does not meet the 'Year of birth' criterion.
- Respondent 121: Born in 2005, so this respondent does not meet the 'Year of birth' criterion.
- Respondent 128: Born in 2005, so this respondent does not meet the 'Year of birth' criterion.
- Respondent 145: Born in 2022, so this respondent does not meet the 'Year of birth' criterion.

From the provided data, only Respondent 53 meets all the specified criteria (born in 2004, 'Loneliness' greater than 6, and 'Depression' less than 3).

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Depression' and 'Stress' is exactly 20.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to examine each respondent's data for the 'Depression' and 'Stress' scores, add these two scores together, and then count how many respondents have a total score of exactly 20.

Let's go through the respondents one by one:

1. Respondent 5: Depression = 0, Stress = 3. Total = 3.
2. Respondent 67: Depression = 0, Stress = 3. Total = 3.
3. Respondent 142: Depression = 2, Stress = 4. Total = 6.
4. Respondent 150: Depression = 3, Stress = 3. Total = 6.
5. Respondent 149: Depression = 1, Stress = 2. Total = 3.
6. Respondent 107: Depression = 1, Stress = 3. Total = 4.
7. Respondent 76: Depression = 2, Stress = 2. Total = 4.
8. Respondent 40: Depression = 3, Stress = 4. Total = 7.
9. Respondent 51: Depression = 1, Stress = 3. Total = 4.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the female respondents whose mother has more than 10 years of education and whose 'Life satisfaction' is 7 or higher.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to identify the female respondents, check if their mother has more than 10 years of education, and see if their 'Life satisfaction' score is 7 or higher.

From the provided data:

1. **Respondent 59**: Female (Gender: 2.0), Mother's education (9.0 years), Life satisfaction (4.0) - Does not meet the criteria.
2. **Respondent 98**: Female (Gender: 2.0), No parental education data, Life satisfaction (6.0) - Does not meet the criteria due to missing parental education data and life satisfaction score.
3. **Respondent 146**: Female (Gender: 2.0), Mother's education (9.0 years), Life satisfaction (7.0) - Does not meet the criteria because the mother's education is exactly 9 years, not more than 10.
4. **Respondent 63**: Male (Gender: 1.0) - Does not meet the gender criteria.
5. **Respondent 128**: Male (Gender: 1.0) - Does not meet the gender criteria.
6. **Respondent 141**: Female (Gender: 2.0), No parental education data, Life satisfaction (8.0) - Does not meet the criteria due to missing parental education data.
7. **Respondent 87**: Male (Gender: 1.0) - Does not meet the gender criteria.
8. **Respondent 66**: Male (Gender: 1.0) - Does not meet the gender criteria.
9. **Respondent 126**: Male (Gender: 1.0) - Does not meet the gender criteria.
10. **Respondent 118**: Female (Gender: 2.0), Mother's education (11.0 years), Life satisfaction (6.0) - Meets the education criterion but not the life satisfaction criterion.

Upon reviewing the data again for accuracy in counting females with more than 10 years of mother's education and life satisfaction of 7 or higher:

- **Respondent 118** does not meet the life satisfaction criterion.
- **Respondent 141** meets the life satisfaction criterion but lacks parental education data.
- **Respondent 146** meets the life satisfaction criterion but the mother's education is exactly 9 years.

Actually, none of the respondents clearly meet all the specified criteria based on the provided data. 

However, re-evaluating the task for females with the specified conditions:

1. Female respondents are those with Gender: 2.0.
2. Mother's education more than 10 years.
3. Life satisfaction of 7 or higher.

Given the strict criteria and upon a detailed review, it appears there was an oversight in the initial analysis regarding the direct match for all criteria specified. The correct approach should involve identifying any respondent that matches all given conditions without assuming data not provided (like parental education for some respondents).

Given this, the actual count based on the provided and correctly interpreted data should reflect the number of respondents that fulfill all conditions accurately. 

The final answer is: $\boxed{0}$",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the female respondents whose mother has more than 12 years of education and whose 'Life satisfaction' is 8 or higher.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to identify the female respondents, check if their mother has more than 12 years of education, and see if their 'Life satisfaction' score is 8 or higher.

From the provided data:

1. **Respondent 20**: Male, so not included.
2. **Respondent 13**: Male, so not included.
3. **Respondent 2**: Female, Mother's education = 11 years, Life satisfaction = 5. Not included because life satisfaction is less than 8.
4. **Respondent 106**: Male, so not included.
5. **Respondent 36**: Female, but Mother's education is not provided. Not included due to missing data.
6. **Respondent 60**: Male, so not included.
7. **Respondent 18**: Male, so not included.
8. **Respondent 39**: Male, so not included.

However, upon re-examining the instructions and the data provided, it seems there was an oversight in the initial analysis regarding the gender identification and the specific criteria for inclusion. Let's correct this and follow the instructions accurately:

- **Respondent 2** is actually female (Gender: 2.0), Mother's education = 11 years, which does not meet the criteria of more than 12 years.
- **Respondent 36** is female, but the Mother's education is not provided, so she cannot be included.
- Other respondents who are female and have relevant data provided need to be identified based on the criteria.

Given the correct approach and upon reviewing the data again with the correct interpretation of the task:

1. **Respondent 2**: Female, but Mother's education is 11 years, which is not more than 12 years.
2. **Respondent 36**: Female, but Mother's education data is missing.
3. **Respondent 13** and **Respondent 20** are males, so they are not included.
4. **Respondent 106** is male, not included.
5. **Respondent 60** is male, not included.
6. **Respondent 18** is male, not included.
7. **Respondent 39** is male, not included.

Actually, the correct identification of female respondents based on the provided data and the specific criteria (Mother's education more than 12 years and Life satisfaction of 8 or higher) yields:

- None of the provided respondents meet all the specified criteria correctly as per the detailed analysis above.

Thus, the correct count based on the given data and the task's requirements is **0**.",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the respondents whose combined 'Depression' and 'Stress' score is lower than the average combined 'Depression' and 'Stress' score for their gender.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average combined 'Depression' and 'Stress' score for each gender. Then, we compare each respondent's score to this average to determine if it's lower.

1. **Calculate the average combined 'Depression' and 'Stress' score for each gender:**

- For males (Gender: 1.0), we sum all 'Depression' and 'Stress' scores and divide by the number of males.
- For females (Gender: 2.0), we do the same.

2. **Identify the respondents whose combined score is lower than the average for their gender:**

- We will go through each respondent's data, calculate their combined 'Depression' and 'Stress' score, and compare it to the average for their gender.

Let's start with calculating the averages:

### Males (Gender: 1.0)

Respondents 130, 117, 96, 16, 124, 125 are males.

- Respondent 130: Depression = 0.0, Stress = 2.0, Combined = 2.0
- Respondent 117: Depression = 0.0, Stress = 3.0, Combined = 3.0
- Respondent 96: Depression = 0.0, Stress = 3.0, Combined = 3.0
- Respondent 16: Depression = 0.0, Stress = 1.0, Combined = 1.0
- Respondent 124: Depression = 0.0, Stress = 2.0, Combined = 2.0
- Respondent 125: Depression = 1.0, Stress = 2.0, Combined = 3.0

Sum of combined scores for males = 2.0 + 3.0 + 3.0 + 1.0 + 2.0 + 3.0 = 14.0

Number of males = 6

Average combined score for males = 14.0 / 6 = 2.3333

### Females (Gender: 2.0)

Only Respondent 56 and Respondent 5 are females.

- Respondent 56: Depression = 1.0, Stress = 4.0, Combined = 5.0
- Respondent 5: Depression = 0.0, Stress = 3.0, Combined = 3.0

Sum of combined scores for females = 5.0 + 3.0 = 8.0

Number of females = 2

Average combined score for females = 8.0 / 2 = 4.0

### Comparing each respondent's score to the average for their gender:

#### Males:
- Respondent 130: 2.0 (lower than 2.3333)
- Respondent 117: 3.0 (higher than 2.3333)
- Respondent 96: 3.0 (higher than 2.3333)
- Respondent 16: 1.0 (lower than 2.3333)
- Respondent 124: 2.0 (lower than 2.3333)
- Respondent 125: 3.0 (higher than 2.3333)

#### Females:
- Respondent 56: 5.0 (higher than 4.0)
- Respondent 5: 3.0 (lower than 4.0)

### Counting the respondents whose combined score is lower than the average for their gender:

Males: Respondent 130, Respondent 16, Respondent 124 (3 respondents)
Females: Respondent 5 (1 respondent)

Total respondents = 3 (males) + 1 (female) = 4

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose 'Worry' is higher than the average 'Worry' for their gender.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Worry' score for each gender and then compare each respondent's 'Worry' score to the average for their respective gender.

1. **Calculate Average 'Worry' for Each Gender:**

- **Male (Gender: 1.0):** 
  - Respondent 137: Worry = 1.0
  - Respondent 106: Worry = 3.0
  - Respondent 4: Worry = 0.0
  - Respondent 138: Worry = 1.0
  - Total Worry for Males = 1.0 + 3.0 + 0.0 + 1.0 = 5.0
  - Number of Males = 4
  - Average Worry for Males = Total Worry for Males / Number of Males = 5.0 / 4 = 1.25

- **Female (Gender: 2.0):**
  - Respondent 142: Worry = 3.0
  - Respondent 5: Worry = 2.0
  - Respondent 136: Worry = 1.0
  - Respondent 71: Worry = 1.0
  - Total Worry for Females = 3.0 + 2.0 + 1.0 + 1.0 = 7.0
  - Number of Females = 4
  - Average Worry for Females = Total Worry for Females / Number of Females = 7.0 / 4 = 1.75

2. **Count Respondents Whose 'Worry' is Higher Than the Average for Their Gender:**

- **Males with Worry > 1.25:**
  - Respondent 106: Worry = 3.0 (Higher than 1.25)
  - Count of Males = 1

- **Females with Worry > 1.75:**
  - Respondent 142: Worry = 3.0 (Higher than 1.75)
  - Count of Females = 1

3. **Total Count:**
   - Total Respondents with Worry higher than the average for their gender = Count of Males + Count of Females = 1 + 1 = 2

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose 'Stress' is higher than the average 'Stress' for their gender.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Stress' for each gender and then compare each respondent's 'Stress' level to this average based on their gender.

1. **Calculate Average Stress for Each Gender:**

- **Male (Gender: 1.0):** 
  - Respondent 129: Stress = 3.0
  - Respondent 111: Stress = 2.0
  - Respondent 28: Stress = 1.0
  - Respondent 135: Stress = 3.0
  - Respondent 39: Stress = 1.0
  - Average Stress for Males = (3.0 + 2.0 + 1.0 + 3.0 + 1.0) / 5 = 10.0 / 5 = 2.0

- **Female (Gender: 2.0):**
  - Respondent 5: Stress = 3.0
  - Respondent 46: Stress = 4.0
  - Respondent 25: Stress = 1.0
  - Respondent 62: Stress = 4.0
  - Respondent 50: Stress = 3.0
  - Average Stress for Females = (3.0 + 4.0 + 1.0 + 4.0 + 3.0) / 5 = 15.0 / 5 = 3.0

2. **Count Respondents with Stress Higher than Average for Their Gender:**

- **Males with Stress > 2.0:** 
  - Respondent 129: Stress = 3.0 (Higher)
  - Respondent 135: Stress = 3.0 (Higher)
  - Total Males = 2

- **Females with Stress > 3.0:**
  - Respondent 46: Stress = 4.0 (Higher)
  - Respondent 62: Stress = 4.0 (Higher)
  - Total Females = 2

3. **Total Respondents with Stress Higher than Average for Their Gender:** 
   - Total = Total Males + Total Females = 2 + 2 = 4

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who were born in a year where the average 'Life satisfaction' for that year was greater than the overall average 'Life satisfaction'.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the overall average 'Life satisfaction' across all respondents. Then, for each year of birth, we calculate the average 'Life satisfaction' and compare it to the overall average. Finally, we count the respondents born in years where the average 'Life satisfaction' for that year exceeds the overall average.

1. **Calculate Overall Average 'Life satisfaction':**
   - Respondent 135: 10.0
   - Respondent 65: 8.0
   - Respondent 91: 8.0
   - Respondent 69: 4.0
   - Respondent 102: 7.0
   - Respondent 21: 5.0
   - Respondent 96: 10.0
   - Respondent 104: 8.0
   - Respondent 118: 6.0
   - Respondent 145: 8.0
   - Respondent 63: 8.0
   - Respondent 58: 7.0
   - Total Life Satisfaction: 10.0 + 8.0 + 8.0 + 4.0 + 7.0 + 5.0 + 10.0 + 8.0 + 6.0 + 8.0 + 8.0 + 7.0 = 88.0
   - Number of Respondents: 12
   - Overall Average Life Satisfaction: 88.0 / 12 = 7.33

2. **Group Respondents by Year of Birth and Calculate Average 'Life satisfaction' for Each Year:**
   - 1993: Respondent 135 - 10.0
   - 2002: Respondents 102, 104 - (7.0 + 8.0) / 2 = 7.5
   - 2003: Respondents 69, 21 - (4.0 + 5.0) / 2 = 4.5
   - 2004: Respondents 63, 58 - (8.0 + 7.0) / 2 = 7.5
   - 2005: Respondents 65, 91, 96, 118 - (8.0 + 8.0 + 10.0 + 6.0) / 4 = 8.0
   - 2022: Respondent 145 - 8.0

3. **Identify Years with Average 'Life satisfaction' Greater Than Overall Average (7.33):**
   - 2002: 7.5 (greater)
   - 2004: 7.5 (greater)
   - 2005: 8.0 (greater)
   - 2022: 8.0 (greater)
   - 1993: 10.0 (greater)

4. **Count Respondents in Identified Years:**
   - 2002: 2 respondents
   - 2004: 2 respondents
   - 2005: 4 respondents
   - 2022: 1 respondent
   - 1993: 1 respondent
   - Total: 2 + 2 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 10 respondents

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who were born in a year where the average 'Life satisfaction' for that year was greater than the overall average 'Life satisfaction'.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the overall average 'Life satisfaction' across all respondents. Then, for each year of birth, we calculate the average 'Life satisfaction' and compare it to the overall average. Finally, we count the respondents born in years where the average 'Life satisfaction' for that year exceeds the overall average.

1. **Calculate Overall Average 'Life satisfaction':**

   - Respondent 21: 5.0
   - Respondent 9: 6.0
   - Respondent 24: 8.0
   - Respondent 104: 8.0
   - Respondent 98: 6.0
   - Respondent 97: 6.0
   - Respondent 142: 7.0
   - Respondent 122: 7.0
   - Respondent 15: 7.0
   - Respondent 3: 6.0

   Overall average = (5.0 + 6.0 + 8.0 + 8.0 + 6.0 + 6.0 + 7.0 + 7.0 + 7.0 + 6.0) / 10 = 65.0 / 10 = 6.5

2. **Group Respondents by Year of Birth and Calculate Average 'Life satisfaction' for Each Year:**

   - 2002: Respondents 9, 104, 97, 15
     - Average = (6.0 + 8.0 + 6.0 + 7.0) / 4 = 27.0 / 4 = 6.75
   - 2003: Respondents 21, 98
     - Average = (5.0 + 6.0) / 2 = 11.0 / 2 = 5.5
   - 2004: Respondents 24, 142
     - Average = (8.0 + 7.0) / 2 = 15.0 / 2 = 7.5
   - 2005: Respondent 122
     - Average = 7.0
   - 1998: Respondent 3
     - Average = 6.0

3. **Identify Years with Average 'Life satisfaction' Greater Than Overall Average (6.5):**

   - 2002: 6.75 > 6.5
   - 2004: 7.5 > 6.5
   - 2005: 7.0 > 6.5

4. **Count Respondents Born in These Years:**

   - 2002: 4 respondents (9, 104, 97, 15)
   - 2004: 2 respondents (24, 142)
   - 2005: 1 respondent (122)

   Total = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7 respondents

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose combined 'Worry' and 'Life satisfaction' score is lower than the average combined 'Worry' and 'Life satisfaction' score for their gender.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average combined 'Worry' and 'Life satisfaction' score for each gender. Then, we compare each respondent's score to the average of their respective gender and count those whose score is lower.

1. **Calculate the average combined 'Worry' and 'Life satisfaction' score for each gender:**

- For males (Gender: 1.0), the respondents are 22, 128, 112, 85, 11.
  - Respondent 22: Worry = 2.0, Life satisfaction = 6.0, Combined = 8.0
  - Respondent 128: Worry = 1.0, Life satisfaction = 8.0, Combined = 9.0
  - Respondent 112: Worry = 1.0, Life satisfaction = 5.0, Combined = 6.0
  - Respondent 85: Worry = 1.0, Life satisfaction = 7.0, Combined = 8.0
  - Respondent 11: Worry = 0.0, Life satisfaction = 8.0, Combined = 8.0
  - Average for males = (8.0 + 9.0 + 6.0 + 8.0 + 8.0) / 5 = 39.0 / 5 = 7.8

- For females (Gender: 2.0), the respondents are 145, 25, 136, 59.
  - Respondent 145: Worry = 2.0, Life satisfaction = 8.0, Combined = 10.0
  - Respondent 25: Worry = 1.0, Life satisfaction = 8.0, Combined = 9.0
  - Respondent 136: Worry = 1.0, Life satisfaction = 6.0, Combined = 7.0
  - Respondent 59: Worry = 1.0, Life satisfaction = 4.0, Combined = 5.0
  - Average for females = (10.0 + 9.0 + 7.0 + 5.0) / 4 = 31.0 / 4 = 7.75

2. **Compare each respondent's score to the average of their respective gender and count those whose score is lower:**

- Males:
  - Respondent 22: 8.0 (lower than 7.8, no)
  - Respondent 128: 9.0 (higher than 7.8)
  - Respondent 112: 6.0 (lower than 7.8, yes)
  - Respondent 85: 8.0 (higher than 7.8)
  - Respondent 11: 8.0 (higher than 7.8)
  - Count for males = 1

- Females:
  - Respondent 145: 10.0 (higher than 7.75)
  - Respondent 25: 9.0 (higher than 7.75)
  - Respondent 136: 7.0 (lower than 7.75, yes)
  - Respondent 59: 5.0 (lower than 7.75, yes)
  - Count for females = 2

3. **Total count of respondents whose combined score is lower than the average for their gender:**

Total count = Count for males + Count for females = 1 + 2 = 3

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$",True

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the respondents who were born in a year where the average 'Life satisfaction' for that year was greater than the overall average 'Life satisfaction'.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the overall average 'Life satisfaction' across all respondents. Then, for each year of birth, we calculate the average 'Life satisfaction' and compare it to the overall average. Finally, we count the respondents born in years where the average 'Life satisfaction' for that year exceeds the overall average.

1. **Calculate Overall Average 'Life satisfaction':**

   - Respondent 146: 7.0
   - Respondent 122: 7.0
   - Respondent 70: 8.0
   - Respondent 12: 6.0
   - Respondent 20: 9.0
   - Respondent 72: 6.0
   - Respondent 140: 3.0
   - Respondent 145: 8.0
   - Respondent 9: 6.0

   Overall average = (7.0 + 7.0 + 8.0 + 6.0 + 9.0 + 6.0 + 3.0 + 8.0 + 6.0) / 9 = 60.0 / 9 = 6.67

2. **Group Respondents by Year of Birth and Calculate Average 'Life satisfaction' for Each Year:**

   - 2005: Respondents 146, 122
     - Average = (7.0 + 7.0) / 2 = 7.0
   - 2004: Respondents 12, 20, 70
     - Average = (6.0 + 9.0 + 8.0) / 3 = 23.0 / 3 = 7.67
   - 2003: Respondent 20
     - Average = 9.0
   - 2002: Respondents 72, 9
     - Average = (6.0 + 6.0) / 2 = 6.0
   - 2001: Respondent 140
     - Average = 3.0
   - 2022: Respondent 145
     - Average = 8.0

3. **Identify Years with Average 'Life satisfaction' Greater Than Overall Average (6.67):**

   - 2004: 7.67
   - 2003: 9.0
   - 2022: 8.0

4. **Count Respondents in Identified Years:**

   - 2004: 3 respondents (12, 20, 70)
   - 2003: 1 respondent (20) *Note: Respondent 20 is already counted in 2004, so we should not count them again as their year of birth is actually 2003, not 2004. The correct count for 2004 should be 2 (12, 70), and for 2003, it's 1 (20).
   - 2022: 1 respondent (145)

Corrected count: 2 (from 2004) + 1 (from 2003) + 1 (from 2022) = 4

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total 'Depressive Symptoms' score is higher than the average for their 'Socio-economic status' group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Depressive Symptoms' score for each 'Socio-economic status' group. Then, we compare each respondent's total 'Depressive Symptoms' score to the average of their respective 'Socio-economic status' group and count those whose score is higher.

Given the complexity and the amount of data provided, let's break down the steps to follow:

1. **Calculate Total 'Depressive Symptoms' Score for Each Respondent:**
   - For each respondent, sum up the scores of all 'Depressive Symptoms Frequency' questions.

2. **Group Respondents by 'Socio-economic status':**
   - Collect all respondents with the same 'Socio-economic status' score into groups (e.g., all with status 3, all with status 5, etc.).

3. **Calculate Average 'Depressive Symptoms' Score for Each 'Socio-economic status' Group:**
   - For each group, calculate the average total 'Depressive Symptoms' score.

4. **Compare Each Respondent's Score to Their Group's Average:**
   - For each respondent, check if their total 'Depressive Symptoms' score is higher than the average score of their 'Socio-economic status' group.

5. **Count Respondents with Scores Higher Than Their Group's Average:**
   - Count the number of respondents whose total 'Depressive Symptoms' score exceeds the average of their respective group.

Let's execute these steps with the provided data:

### Step 1 & 2: Calculate Total 'Depressive Symptoms' Score and Group Respondents

Due to the extensive nature of the data, let's directly calculate and compare for a few respondents to illustrate the process, then apply it to all.

- **Respondent 81:** Total 'Depressive Symptoms' = 3 (Anhedonia) + 3 (Sleep Problems) + 3 (Fatigue) + 1 (Appetite Changes) + 1 (Feelings of Worthlessness) + 0 (Concentration Difficulties) + 1 (Suicidal Thoughts) = 12. Socio-economic status: 3.
- **Respondent 5:** Total 'Depressive Symptoms' = 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 3 + 0 + 0 = 4. Socio-economic status: 6.
- **Respondent 54:** Total 'Depressive Symptoms' = 2 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 12. Socio-economic status: 3.
- **Respondent 37:** Total 'Depressive Symptoms' = 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 4. Socio-economic status: 5.
- **Respondent 102:** Total 'Depressive Symptoms' = 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 2. Socio-economic status: 5.
- **Respondent 20:** Total 'Depressive Symptoms' = 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 1. Socio-economic status: 6.
- **Respondent 77:** Total 'Depressive Symptoms' = 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 4. Socio-economic status: 3.
- **Respondent 42:** Total 'Depressive Symptoms' = 3 + 3 + 3 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 9. Socio-economic status: 5.
- **Respondent 145:** Total 'Depressive Symptoms' = 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 7. Socio-economic status: 3.

### Step 3: Calculate Average 'Depressive Symptoms' Score for Each Group

- **Socio-economic status 3:** Respondents 81, 54, 77, 145. Total scores: 12 + 12 + 4 + 7 = 35. Average: 35 / 4 = 8.75.
- **Socio-economic status 5:** Respondents 37, 102, 42. Total scores: 4 + 2 + 9 = 15. Average: 15 / 3 = 5.
- **Socio-economic status 6:** Respondents 5, 20. Total scores: 4 + 1 = 5. Average: 5 / 2 = 2.5.

### Step 4 & 5: Compare and Count

- **Socio-economic status 3:** 
  - Respondent 81 (12) is lower than the average (8.75).
  - Respondent 54 (12) is lower than the average (8.75).
  - Respondent 77 (4) is lower than the average (8.75).
  - Respondent 145 (7) is lower than the average (8.75).
  - None are higher.
- **Socio-economic status 5:**
  - Respondent 37 (4) is lower than the average (5).
  - Respondent 102 (2) is lower than the average (5).
  - Respondent 42 (9) is higher than the average (5).
  - 1 respondent is higher.
- **Socio-economic status 6:**
  - Respondent 5 (4) is higher than the average (2.5).
  - Respondent 20 (1) is lower than the average (2.5).
  - 1 respondent is higher.

### Final Count

From the comparison, we have:
- 0 respondents from Socio-economic status 3 with scores higher than their group's average.
- 1 respondent from Socio-economic status 5 with a score higher than their group's average.
- 1 respondent from Socio-economic status 6 with a score higher than their group's average.

Therefore, the total count of respondents whose total 'Depressive Symptoms' score is higher than the average for their 'Socio-economic status' group is 2.",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose combined 'Life satisfaction' and 'Depression' score is lower than the average combined 'Life satisfaction' and 'Depression' score for their gender.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average combined 'Life satisfaction' and 'Depression' score for each gender. Then, we compare each respondent's score to the average of their respective gender and count those whose score is lower.

### Step 1: Calculate Average Combined Scores by Gender

- **Male (Gender: 1.0)**: 
  - Respondents: 100, 85, 99, 129, 89
  - Scores: (8+1), (7+0), (5+1), (7+1), (9+0) = 9, 7, 6, 8, 9
  - Average = (9 + 7 + 6 + 8 + 9) / 5 = 39 / 5 = 7.8
- **Female (Gender: 2.0)**: 
  - Respondents: 146, 139, 36, 21
  - Scores: (7+2), (6+3), (7+0), (5+3) = 9, 9, 7, 8
  - Average = (9 + 9 + 7 + 8) / 4 = 33 / 4 = 8.25

### Step 2: Compare Each Respondent's Score to Their Gender's Average

- **Males**:
  - 100: 9 (>= 7.8)
  - 85: 7 (< 7.8)
  - 99: 6 (< 7.8)
  - 129: 8 (< 7.8)
  - 89: 9 (>= 7.8)
- **Females**:
  - 146: 9 (< 8.25)
  - 139: 9 (< 8.25)
  - 36: 7 (< 8.25)
  - 21: 8 (< 8.25)

### Step 3: Count Respondents with Lower Scores

- **Males with lower scores**: 85, 99, 129 = 3
- **Females with lower scores**: 146, 139, 36, 21 = 4

Total respondents with lower scores = 3 (Males) + 4 (Females) = 7

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$",True
case_50,respondent_count,Count the respondents who were born in a year where the average 'Life satisfaction' for that year was greater than the overall average 'Life satisfaction'.,"# Survey Data

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who were born in a year where the average 'Life satisfaction' for that year was greater than the overall average 'Life satisfaction'.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the overall average 'Life satisfaction' across all respondents. Then, for each year of birth, we calculate the average 'Life satisfaction' and compare it to the overall average. Finally, we count the respondents born in years where the average 'Life satisfaction' for that year exceeds the overall average.

1. **Calculate Overall Average 'Life satisfaction':**

   - Respondent 26: 4.0
   - Respondent 112: 5.0
   - Respondent 60: 8.0
   - Respondent 20: 9.0
   - Respondent 88: 7.0
   - Respondent 102: 7.0
   - Respondent 84: 9.0
   - Respondent 8: 8.0

   Overall average = (4.0 + 5.0 + 8.0 + 9.0 + 7.0 + 7.0 + 9.0 + 8.0) / 8 = 58.0 / 8 = 7.25

2. **Group Respondents by Year of Birth and Calculate Average 'Life satisfaction' for Each Year:**

   - 2000: Respondent 60 - 8.0
   - 2001: Respondents 112, 88 - (5.0 + 7.0) / 2 = 12.0 / 2 = 6.0
   - 2002: Respondents 102, 84 - (7.0 + 9.0) / 2 = 16.0 / 2 = 8.0
   - 2003: Respondents 20, 8 - (9.0 + 8.0) / 2 = 17.0 / 2 = 8.5
   - 2004: Respondent 26 - 4.0

3. **Identify Years with Average 'Life satisfaction' Greater Than Overall Average (7.25):**

   - 2002: 8.0 (greater than 7.25)
   - 2003: 8.5 (greater than 7.25)

4. **Count Respondents Born in Identified Years:**

   - 2002: Respondents 102, 84 - 2 respondents
   - 2003: Respondents 20, 8 - 2 respondents

   Total respondents = 2 + 2 = 4

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$",True
