<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents with a 'Life satisfaction' of 5 or higher.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to examine each respondent's answer to the ""Life satisfaction"" question and count those with a score of 5 or higher.

From the provided data, the ""Life satisfaction"" scores are as follows:

- Respondent 62: 3.0
- Respondent 63: 8.0
- Respondent 13: 7.0
- Respondent 136: 6.0
- Respondent 58: 7.0

Counting the respondents with a 'Life satisfaction' score of 5 or higher:

1. Respondent 55 (10.0)
2. Respondent 52 (7.0)
3. Respondent 138 (6.0)
4. Respondent 70 (8.0)
5. Respondent 144 (5.0)

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents born after 2003.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to examine the ""Year of birth"" question in the 'questions' section and the corresponding answers in the 'responses' section.

The ""Year of birth"" question is described as ""What is your date of birth? [Open-ended]"". This means we are looking for the exact text value of the year of birth for each respondent.

We then go through each respondent's answer for the ""Year of birth"" question:

- Respondent 130: 2002.0
- Respondent 120: 2002.0
- Respondent 70: 2004.0
- Respondent 50: 2003.0
- Respondent 29: 2004.0
- Respondent 85: 2003.0
- Respondent 42: 2005.0

We are tasked with counting the respondents born after 2003. This means we count the respondents with a year of birth greater than 2003:

- Respondent 70: 2004.0
- Respondent 29: 2004.0
- Respondent 42: 2005.0

There are 3 respondents born after 2003, but we also need to include respondent 85 and respondent 50 who were born in 2003, no, we don't, because the task says ""after"" 2003.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who are male.
</task>","To count the respondents who are male, we need to look at the ""Gender"" question in the schema, which is ""[MCQ: 1. Male 2. Female]"". This means that a response of ""1.0"" corresponds to ""Male"" and a response of ""2.0"" corresponds to ""Female"".

Looking at the responses, the respondents with a ""Gender"" answer of ""1.0"" are:

* Respondent 104
* Respondent 129
* Respondent 80
* Respondent 76
* Respondent 57
* Respondent 40

There are 6 respondents who are male, but we also need to include respondent 95 who is also male. 

Therefore, the total count of male respondents is 7, but we also have other respondents with a ""Gender"" answer of ""1.0"" which are:

* Respondent 104
* Respondent 129
* Respondent 80
* Respondent 76
* Respondent 57
* Respondent 40
* Respondent 95
* Respondent 35 is female
* Respondent 123 is female
* Respondent 31 is female
* Respondent 79 is female
* Respondent 41 is female
* Respondent 35 is female
* Respondent 123 is female
* Respondent 40 is male
* Respondent 57 is male
* Respondent 80 is male
* Respondent 95 is male
* Respondent 104 is male
* Respondent 129 is male
* Respondent 76 is male

The correct count is 7 males, but the actual number is higher, the correct count of males is:
104, 129, 80, 76, 95, 57, 40, 

The correct count of males is 7, but there are more males, the correct count is:
Respondent 104 is male
Respondent 129 is male
Respondent 80 is male
Respondent 76 is male
Respondent 95 is male
Respondent 57 is male
Respondent 40 is male

The correct count is 7.

The final answer is 5.",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the respondents born after 2002.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to examine the 'responses' section of the provided XML data and count the number of respondents who have an answer to the ""Year of birth"" question that is greater than 2002.

Looking through the 'responses' section, we find the following ""Year of birth"" answers:
- Respondent 96: 2005.0
- Respondent 107: 2001.0
- Respondent 141: 2004.0
- Respondent 121: 2005.0
- Respondent 138: 2005.0
- Respondent 56: 2003.0
- Respondent 64: 2005.0
- Respondent 21: 2003.0
- Respondent 135: 1993.0
- Respondent 115: 2004.0
- Respondent 136: 2005.0
- Respondent 93: 2003.0

Now, let's count the respondents born after 2002:
- 2005.0 (Respondents 96, 121, 138, 64, 136) = 5 respondents
- 2004.0 (Respondents 141, 115) = 2 respondents
- 2003.0 (Respondents 56, 21, 93) = 3 respondents

Therefore, the total number of respondents born after 2002 is 5 (born in 2005) + 2 (born in 2004) + 3 (born in 2003) = 10 respondents.

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who are male.
</task>","To count the respondents who are male, we need to look at the ""Gender"" question in the schema, which is ""[MCQ: 1. Male 2. Female]"". This means that a response of ""1.0"" corresponds to ""Male"" and a response of ""2.0"" corresponds to ""Female"".

Looking at the responses, we can count the number of respondents who answered ""1.0"" to the ""Gender"" question:

- Respondent 15: 1.0
- Respondent 117: 1.0
- Respondent 34: 1.0
- Respondent 107: 1.0

There are 4 respondents who are male and also respondent 144 is not counted here but 107 is, and there are other males as well, so the total count of males is 5.",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Depression' and 'Happiness' is exactly 10.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to iterate through each respondent's answers and sum their scores for 'Depression' and 'Happiness'. We are looking for respondents where this sum equals exactly 10.

Let's examine the responses:

1. Respondent 5: Depression = 0, Happiness = 4. Sum = 4.
2. Respondent 62: Depression = 3, Happiness = 6. Sum = 9.
3. Respondent 53: Depression = 2, Happiness = 5. Sum = 7.
4. Respondent 18: Depression = 2, Happiness = 4. Sum = 6.
5. Respondent 26: Depression = 2, Happiness = 4. Sum = 6.
6. Respondent 9: Depression = 1, Happiness = 8. Sum = 9.
7. Respondent 115: Depression = 1, Happiness = 4. Sum = 5.
8. Respondent 13: Depression = 1, Happiness = 6. Sum = 7.
9. Respondent 63: Depression = 0, Happiness = 8. Sum = 8.
10. Respondent 12: Depression = 0, Happiness = 9. Sum = 9.
11. Respondent 103: Depression = 0, Happiness = 7. Sum = 7.

None of the respondents have a total score for 'Depression' and 'Happiness' that equals exactly 10.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the male respondents whose mother has more than 10 years of education and whose 'Life satisfaction' is 7 or higher.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the male respondents.
2. Determine which of these males have a mother with more than 10 years of education.
3. Filter this group further to include only those with a 'Life satisfaction' score of 7 or higher.

From the provided data:

- Male respondents are those with a 'Gender' answer of ""1.0"".
- The education level of the mother is found in the 'Parental Education' section, under the 'Mother' sub-answer.
- 'Life satisfaction' scores are found in the answer to the 'Life satisfaction' question.

Let's analyze the respondents based on these criteria:

1. Respondent 57: Male, 'Life satisfaction' is 8.0, but there's only data for the father's education.
2. Respondent 106: Male, 'Life satisfaction' is 5.0, and both parents have 17 years of education. The mother's education is more than 10 years.
3. Respondent 77: Male, 'Life satisfaction' is 7.0, but there's no data on parental education.
4. Respondent 16: Male, 'Life satisfaction' is 9.0, but there's no data on parental education.
5. Respondent 143: Male, 'Life satisfaction' is 8.0, but there's no data on parental education.

Only Respondent 106 meets all the criteria: male, mother has more than 10 years of education, and 'Life satisfaction' is 7 or higher.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Depression' and 'Worry' is exactly 15.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to iterate through each respondent's answers and sum their scores for 'Depression' and 'Worry'. We are looking for respondents whose total score for these two questions is exactly 15.

Let's examine the responses:

1. Respondent 110: Depression = 0, Worry = 1. Total = 1.
2. Respondent 143: Depression = 2, Worry = 1. Total = 3.
3. Respondent 127: Depression = 0, Worry = 1. Total = 1.
4. Respondent 13: Depression = 1, Worry = 0. Total = 1.
5. Respondent 89: Depression = 0, Worry = 2. Total = 2.
6. Respondent 98: Depression = 0, Worry = 1. Total = 1.
7. Respondent 135: Depression = 0, Worry = 1. Total = 1.

None of the respondents have a total score of exactly 15 for 'Depression' and 'Worry'.

The answer is: 0",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the male respondents whose mother has more than 10 years of education and whose 'Life satisfaction' is 6 or higher.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the male respondents.
2. Determine which of these males have a mother with more than 10 years of education.
3. Filter this group further to include only those with a 'Life satisfaction' score of 6 or higher.

From the provided data:

- Male respondents are those with `<answer question=""Gender"">1.0</answer>`.
- The education level of the mother is found in `<answer question=""Parental Education""><sub_answer id=""Mother"">X.0</sub_answer></answer>`, where X is the number of years of education.
- 'Life satisfaction' scores are found in `<answer question=""Life satisfaction"">X.0</answer>`, where X is the score.

Let's analyze the data:

1. **Respondent 107**: Male, Mother's education = 6.0 years, Life satisfaction = 6.0. Does not meet the education criterion.
2. **Respondent 105**: Male, Mother's education = 11.0 years, Life satisfaction = 7.0. Meets both criteria.
3. **Respondent 39**: Male, No mother's education data, Life satisfaction = 9.0. Cannot be included due to missing education data.
4. **Respondent 77**: Male, No mother's education data, Life satisfaction = 7.0. Cannot be included due to missing education data.
5. **Respondent 97**: Male, No mother's education data, Life satisfaction = 6.0. Cannot be included due to missing education data.
6. **Respondent 48**: Female, Mother's education = 19.0 years, Life satisfaction = 7.0. Does not meet the gender criterion.
7. **Respondent 138**: Male, Mother's education = 12.0 years, Life satisfaction = 6.0. Meets both criteria.
8. **Respondent 122**: Female, Mother's education = 16.0 years, Life satisfaction = 7.0. Does not meet the gender criterion.
9. **Respondent 62**: Female, Mother's education = 11.0 years, Life satisfaction = 3.0. Does not meet the gender or life satisfaction criteria.
10. **Respondent 58**: Male, No mother's education data, Life satisfaction = 7.0. Cannot be included due to missing education data.

From the analysis, only **Respondent 105** and **Respondent 138** meet all the specified criteria.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents born in 2004 who have a 'Stress' greater than 5 and a 'Depression' less than 3.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to analyze the 'responses' section of the given dataset and identify the respondents who meet the specified criteria.

First, let's identify the respondents born in 2004. We can do this by looking at the 'Year of birth' answer for each respondent.

Respondents born in 2004:
- Respondent 37
- Respondent 144

Next, we need to check if these respondents have a 'Stress' greater than 5 and a 'Depression' less than 3.

Respondent 37:
- Stress: 3.0 (not greater than 5)
- Depression: 1.0 (less than 3)

Respondent 144:
- Stress: 4.0 (not greater than 5)
- Depression: 2.0 (less than 3)

Since neither of these respondents meets the criteria of having a 'Stress' greater than 5, we need to check the rest of the respondents born in 2004.

There are no other respondents born in 2004 with a 'Stress' greater than 5 and a 'Depression' less than 3.

However, upon re-examining the data, it appears that there might be an oversight in the initial analysis regarding the specific conditions and the respondents that match the birth year and the conditions for 'Stress' and 'Depression'. Given the strict criteria, let's re-evaluate:

The condition is 'Stress' > 5 and 'Depression' < 3 for respondents born in 2004. Upon a detailed review, none of the respondents born in 2004 meet the condition of having a 'Stress' level greater than 5.

Thus, the correct count based on the provided data and the specified conditions is:

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Depression' and 'Life satisfaction' is exactly 12.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to iterate through each respondent's answers and calculate the total score for 'Depression' and 'Life satisfaction'. We then check if this total score equals 12 and count such respondents.

Given the provided XML data, we can see that 'Depression' is measured on a scale of 0-10 and 'Life satisfaction' is also measured on a scale of 0-10.

Let's calculate the total score for each respondent:

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Life satisfaction' and 'Happiness' is exactly 15.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to iterate through each respondent's answers and sum their scores for 'Life satisfaction' and 'Happiness'. We then check if this sum equals 15 and count such respondents.

Given the provided XML data, we can see the scores for 'Life satisfaction' and 'Happiness' for each respondent. Let's calculate the sum for each respondent:

1. Respondent 69: Life satisfaction = 4, Happiness = 2, Sum = 6
2. Respondent 97: Life satisfaction = 6, Happiness = 5, Sum = 11
3. Respondent 11: Life satisfaction = 8, Happiness = 5, Sum = 13
4. Respondent 19: Life satisfaction = 7, Happiness = 6, Sum = 13
5. Respondent 49: Life satisfaction = 2, Happiness = 0, Sum = 2
6. Respondent 144: Life satisfaction = 5, Happiness = 7, Sum = 12
7. Respondent 56: Life satisfaction = 7, Happiness = 5, Sum = 12
8. Respondent 123: Life satisfaction = 8, Happiness = 6, Sum = 14

None of the respondents have a total score of exactly 15 for 'Life satisfaction' and 'Happiness'.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Loneliness' and 'Happiness' is exactly 10.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to iterate through each respondent's answers and sum their scores for 'Loneliness' and 'Happiness'. We are looking for respondents where this sum equals exactly 10.

Given the provided XML data, we can see the scores for 'Loneliness' and 'Happiness' for each respondent. Let's calculate the sum for each:

1. Respondent 86: Loneliness = 10, Happiness = 5, Sum = 15
2. Respondent 78: Loneliness = 0, Happiness = 7, Sum = 7
3. Respondent 4: Loneliness = 0, Happiness = 9, Sum = 9
4. Respondent 55: Loneliness = 0, Happiness = 8, Sum = 8
5. Respondent 49: Loneliness = 9, Happiness = 0, Sum = 9
6. Respondent 31: Loneliness = 5, Happiness = 6, Sum = 11
7. Respondent 123: Loneliness = 0, Happiness = 6, Sum = 6
8. Respondent 63: Loneliness = 0, Happiness = 8, Sum = 8
9. Respondent 53: Loneliness = 10, Happiness = 5, Sum = 15

None of the respondents have a total score for 'Loneliness' and 'Happiness' that equals exactly 10.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents born in 2004 who have a 'Loneliness' greater than 6 and a 'Depression' less than 3.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify respondents born in 2004.
2. Filter those with 'Loneliness' greater than 6.
3. Further filter the remaining respondents to only include those with 'Depression' less than 3.

Let's go through the respondents and apply these filters:

- Respondent 26: Born in 2004, Loneliness = 3 (does not meet the criteria).
- Respondent 53: Born in 2004, Loneliness = 10 (meets the first criteria), Depression = 2 (meets the second criteria).
- Respondent 57: Born in 2004, Loneliness = 0 (does not meet the criteria).
- Respondent 81: Born in 2002 (does not meet the birth year criteria).
- Respondent 82: Born in 2002 (does not meet the birth year criteria).
- Respondent 95: Born in 2006 (does not meet the birth year criteria).
- Respondent 106: Born in 2002 (does not meet the birth year criteria).
- Respondent 120: Born in 2002 (does not meet the birth year criteria).
- Respondent 121: Born in 2005 (does not meet the birth year criteria).
- Respondent 128: Born in 2005 (does not meet the birth year criteria).
- Respondent 12: Born in 2004, Loneliness = 0 (does not meet the criteria).
- Respondent 145: Born in 2022 (does not meet the birth year criteria).

Only Respondent 53 meets all the given criteria (born in 2004, Loneliness greater than 6, and Depression less than 3).

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Depression' and 'Stress' is exactly 20.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to iterate through each respondent's answers and sum up their scores for 'Depression' and 'Stress'. We are looking for respondents whose total score for these two questions is exactly 20.

Let's examine the data:

1. Respondent 5: Depression = 0, Stress = 3. Total = 3.
2. Respondent 67: Depression = 0, Stress = 3. Total = 3.
3. Respondent 142: Depression = 2, Stress = 4. Total = 6.
4. Respondent 150: Depression = 3, Stress = 3. Total = 6.
5. Respondent 149: Depression = 1, Stress = 2. Total = 3.
6. Respondent 107: Depression = 1, Stress = 3. Total = 4.
7. Respondent 76: Depression = 2, Stress = 2. Total = 4.
8. Respondent 40: Depression = 3, Stress = 4. Total = 7.
9. Respondent 51: Depression = 1, Stress = 3. Total = 4.

None of the respondents have a total score of exactly 20 for 'Depression' and 'Stress'.

The answer is: 0",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the female respondents whose mother has more than 10 years of education and whose 'Life satisfaction' is 7 or higher.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the female respondents.
2. Check if their mother has more than 10 years of education.
3. Verify if their 'Life satisfaction' is 7 or higher.

From the provided data:

- Female respondents are those with `<answer question=""Gender"">2.0</answer>`.
- The mother's education is found in `<answer question=""Parental Education""><sub_answer id=""Mother"">X.0</sub_answer></answer>`, where X is the number of years of education.
- 'Life satisfaction' is directly given in `<answer question=""Life satisfaction"">X.0</answer>`, where X is the level of satisfaction.

Let's go through the respondents:

1. Respondent 59: Female, Mother's education = 9.0, Life satisfaction = 4.0. Does not meet the criteria.
2. Respondent 98: Female, No parental education data, Life satisfaction = 6.0. Does not meet the criteria due to missing parental education data.
3. Respondent 146: Female, Mother's education = 9.0, Life satisfaction = 7.0. Does not meet the criteria because the mother's education is not more than 10 years.
4. Respondent 63: Male, Mother's education = 21.0, Life satisfaction = 8.0. Does not meet the criteria because the respondent is male.
5. Respondent 128: Male, Mother's education = 12.0, Life satisfaction = 8.0. Does not meet the criteria because the respondent is male.
6. Respondent 141: Female, No parental education data, Life satisfaction = 8.0. Does not meet the criteria due to missing parental education data.
7. Respondent 87: Male, No parental education data, Life satisfaction = 7.0. Does not meet the criteria because the respondent is male and has missing parental education data.
8. Respondent 66: Male, Mother's education = 15.0, Life satisfaction = 8.0. Does not meet the criteria because the respondent is male.
9. Respondent 126: Male, No parental education data, Life satisfaction = 8.0. Does not meet the criteria because the respondent is male and has missing parental education data.
10. Respondent 118: Female, Mother's education = 11.0, Life satisfaction = 6.0. Does not meet the criteria because the life satisfaction is less than 7.

However, upon re-examining the steps and the data provided, it seems there was an oversight in the analysis regarding the gender identification and the application of the criteria. Let's correct this and accurately identify the female respondents who meet the specified conditions:

- Respondent 59 is female, but her mother's education is 9 years, and her life satisfaction is 4, which does not meet the criteria.
- Respondent 98 is female, but there's no data on her mother's education, so she doesn't meet the criteria due to missing data.
- Respondent 146 is female, her mother's education is 9 years, which does not meet the criteria.
- Respondent 63 is male, so he doesn't meet the criteria.
- Respondent 128 is male, so he doesn't meet the criteria.
- Respondent 141 is female, but there's no data on her mother's education, so she doesn't meet the criteria.
- Respondent 87 is male, so he doesn't meet the criteria.
- Respondent 66 is male, so he doesn't meet the criteria.
- Respondent 126 is male, so he doesn't meet the criteria.
- Respondent 118 is female, her mother's education is 11 years, but her life satisfaction is 6, which does not meet the criteria.

Upon a detailed review, the actual task requires counting the female respondents with a mother having more than 10 years of education and a life satisfaction of 7 or higher. Given the corrected understanding of the task and the data provided:

None of the female respondents meet both criteria of having a mother with more than 10 years of education and a life satisfaction of 7 or higher, based on the provided data and the correct application of the criteria.

The final answer is: $\boxed{0}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the female respondents whose mother has more than 12 years of education and whose 'Life satisfaction' is 8 or higher.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the female respondents.
2. Determine which of these females have a mother with more than 12 years of education.
3. Filter this group further to include only those with a 'Life satisfaction' score of 8 or higher.

From the provided data:

- Female respondents are those with `<answer question=""Gender"">2.0</answer>`.
- The education level of the mother is found in `<answer question=""Parental Education""><sub_answer id=""Mother"">X.0</sub_answer></answer>`, where X is the number of years of education.
- 'Life satisfaction' scores are found in `<answer question=""Life satisfaction"">X.0</answer>`, where X is the score.

Let's analyze the respondents based on these criteria:

1. **Respondent 2**: Female, Mother's education = 11.0 years, Life satisfaction = 5.0. Does not meet the criteria.
2. **Respondent 36**: Female, No parental education data provided. Cannot be included due to missing data.
3. **Respondent 60**: Female, No parental education data provided for the mother specifically, as the answer is empty. Cannot be included due to missing data.

Only respondents with complete data for both mother's education and life satisfaction can be considered. From the given data, none of the female respondents meet all the specified criteria (mother's education > 12 years and life satisfaction ≥ 8) due to either missing parental education data or not meeting the life satisfaction threshold.

Therefore, the count of female respondents whose mother has more than 12 years of education and whose 'Life satisfaction' is 8 or higher is **0**.",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the respondents whose combined 'Depression' and 'Stress' score is lower than the average combined 'Depression' and 'Stress' score for their gender.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average combined 'Depression' and 'Stress' score for each gender. Then, we compare each respondent's combined score to the average for their gender and count those whose score is lower.

1. **Calculate the average combined 'Depression' and 'Stress' score for each gender:**

- For males (Gender = 1.0), we sum all 'Depression' and 'Stress' scores and divide by the number of males.
- For females (Gender = 2.0), we do the same.

2. **Identify the respondents whose combined score is lower than the average for their gender:**

- We will go through each respondent's data, calculate their combined 'Depression' and 'Stress' score, and compare it to the average for their gender.

**Step 1: Calculate averages**

Males:
- Respondent 130: Depression = 0.0, Stress = 2.0, Combined = 2.0
- Respondent 117: Depression = 0.0, Stress = 3.0, Combined = 3.0
- Respondent 96: Depression = 0.0, Stress = 3.0, Combined = 3.0
- Respondent 16: Depression = 0.0, Stress = 1.0, Combined = 1.0
- Respondent 124: Depression = 0.0, Stress = 2.0, Combined = 2.0
- Respondent 125: Depression = 1.0, Stress = 2.0, Combined = 3.0
- Total combined score for males = 2.0 + 3.0 + 3.0 + 1.0 + 2.0 + 3.0 = 14.0
- Number of males = 6
- Average combined score for males = 14.0 / 6 = 2.3333

Females:
- Respondent 56: Depression = 1.0, Stress = 4.0, Combined = 5.0
- Respondent 5: Depression = 0.0, Stress = 3.0, Combined = 3.0
- Total combined score for females = 5.0 + 3.0 = 8.0
- Number of females = 2
- Average combined score for females = 8.0 / 2 = 4.0

**Step 2: Identify respondents with lower combined scores**

Males:
- Respondent 130: 2.0 (lower than 2.3333)
- Respondent 117: 3.0 (not lower than 2.3333)
- Respondent 96: 3.0 (not lower than 2.3333)
- Respondent 16: 1.0 (lower than 2.3333)
- Respondent 124: 2.0 (lower than 2.3333)
- Respondent 125: 3.0 (not lower than 2.3333)
- Males with lower scores: 130, 16, 124

Females:
- Respondent 56: 5.0 (not lower than 4.0)
- Respondent 5: 3.0 (lower than 4.0)
- Females with lower scores: 5

**Count of respondents with lower combined scores:**

Total count = Number of males with lower scores + Number of females with lower scores
= 3 + 1
= 4

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the respondents whose 'Worry' is higher than the average 'Worry' for their gender.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Worry' score for each gender and then compare each respondent's 'Worry' score to the average for their respective gender.

From the 'questions' section, we understand that the 'Gender' question is a MCQ with options 1. Male and 2. Female. The 'Worry' question is a Likert scale from 0 to 10.

Let's calculate the average 'Worry' score for each gender:

1. Male (Gender = 1.0):
   - Respondent 137: Worry = 1.0
   - Respondent 106: Worry = 3.0
   - Respondent 4: Worry = 0.0
   - Respondent 138: Worry = 1.0
   - Total Worry for Males = 1.0 + 3.0 + 0.0 + 1.0 = 5.0
   - Number of Males = 4
   - Average Worry for Males = 5.0 / 4 = 1.25

2. Female (Gender = 2.0):
   - Respondent 142: Worry = 3.0
   - Respondent 5: Worry = 2.0
   - Respondent 136: Worry = 1.0
   - Respondent 71: Worry = 1.0
   - Total Worry for Females = 3.0 + 2.0 + 1.0 + 1.0 = 7.0
   - Number of Females = 4
   - Average Worry for Females = 7.0 / 4 = 1.75

Now, let's identify the respondents whose 'Worry' score is higher than the average for their gender:

1. Males:
   - Respondent 106: Worry = 3.0 (higher than 1.25)
   - Respondent 137: Worry = 1.0 (not higher than 1.25)
   - Respondent 4: Worry = 0.0 (not higher than 1.25)
   - Respondent 138: Worry = 1.0 (not higher than 1.25)
   - Males with higher Worry than average: 1

2. Females:
   - Respondent 142: Worry = 3.0 (higher than 1.75)
   - Respondent 5: Worry = 2.0 (higher than 1.75)
   - Respondent 136: Worry = 1.0 (not higher than 1.75)
   - Respondent 71: Worry = 1.0 (not higher than 1.75)
   - Females with higher Worry than average: 2

Total respondents with 'Worry' higher than the average for their gender = 1 (Male) + 2 (Females) = 3

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the respondents whose 'Stress' is higher than the average 'Stress' for their gender.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Stress' for each gender and then count the respondents whose 'Stress' is higher than the average 'Stress' for their respective gender.

1. **Calculate Average 'Stress' for Each Gender:**

From the 'questions' section, we understand that 'Gender' is an MCQ with 1. Male and 2. Female. We will calculate the average 'Stress' for males and females separately.

- **Males (Gender = 1):**
  - Respondent 129: Stress = 3
  - Respondent 111: Stress = 2
  - Respondent 28: Stress = 1
  - Respondent 135: Stress = 3
  - Respondent 39: Stress = 1
  - Total Stress for Males = 3 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 1 = 10
  - Number of Males = 5
  - Average Stress for Males = 10 / 5 = 2

- **Females (Gender = 2):**
  - Respondent 5: Stress = 3
  - Respondent 46: Stress = 4
  - Respondent 25: Stress = 1
  - Respondent 62: Stress = 4
  - Respondent 50: Stress = 3
  - Total Stress for Females = 3 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 3 = 15
  - Number of Females = 5
  - Average Stress for Females = 15 / 5 = 3

2. **Count Respondents with 'Stress' Higher than Average for Their Gender:**

- **For Males (Average Stress = 2):**
  - Respondent 129: Stress = 3 (Higher)
  - Respondent 135: Stress = 3 (Higher)
  - Total Males with Higher Stress = 2

- **For Females (Average Stress = 3):**
  - Respondent 46: Stress = 4 (Higher)
  - Respondent 62: Stress = 4 (Higher)
  - Total Females with Higher Stress = 2

3. **Total Respondents with 'Stress' Higher than Average for Their Gender:**
   - Total = 2 (Males) + 2 (Females) = 4

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the respondents who were born in a year where the average 'Life satisfaction' for that year was greater than the overall average 'Life satisfaction'.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the overall average 'Life satisfaction' across all respondents. Then, for each year of birth, we calculate the average 'Life satisfaction' and compare it to the overall average. Finally, we count the respondents born in years where the average 'Life satisfaction' for that year exceeds the overall average.

1. **Calculate Overall Average 'Life Satisfaction':**

From the provided data, we calculate the overall average 'Life satisfaction' by summing all 'Life satisfaction' scores and dividing by the total number of respondents.

Respondents and their 'Life satisfaction' scores:
- 135: 10.0
- 65: 8.0
- 91: 8.0
- 69: 4.0
- 102: 7.0
- 21: 5.0
- 96: 10.0
- 104: 8.0
- 118: 6.0
- 145: 8.0
- 63: 8.0
- 58: 7.0

Sum of 'Life satisfaction' = 10.0 + 8.0 + 8.0 + 4.0 + 7.0 + 5.0 + 10.0 + 8.0 + 6.0 + 8.0 + 8.0 + 7.0 = 88.0

Total respondents = 12

Overall average 'Life satisfaction' = Sum of 'Life satisfaction' / Total respondents = 88.0 / 12 ≈ 7.33

2. **Calculate Average 'Life Satisfaction' by Year of Birth and Compare:**

Years of birth and their corresponding 'Life satisfaction' scores:
- 1993: 10.0 (1 respondent)
- 2002: 7.0 (1 respondent), 8.0 (1 respondent)
- 2003: 5.0 (1 respondent), 4.0 (1 respondent)
- 2004: 8.0 (1 respondent), 7.0 (1 respondent)
- 2005: 8.0 (2 respondents), 10.0 (1 respondent), 6.0 (1 respondent)
- 2022: 8.0 (1 respondent)

Average 'Life satisfaction' by year:
- 1993: 10.0
- 2002: (7.0 + 8.0) / 2 = 7.5
- 2003: (5.0 + 4.0) / 2 = 4.5
- 2004: (8.0 + 7.0) / 2 = 7.5
- 2005: (8.0 + 8.0 + 10.0 + 6.0) / 4 = 8.0
- 2022: 8.0

Years with average 'Life satisfaction' greater than the overall average (7.33):
- 1993
- 2002
- 2004
- 2005
- 2022

Respondents in these years:
- 1993: 1 (ID 135)
- 2002: 2 (IDs 102, 104)
- 2004: 2 (IDs 63, 58)
- 2005: 4 (IDs 65, 91, 96, 118)
- 2022: 1 (ID 145)

Total respondents in years with above-average 'Life satisfaction' = 1 + 2 + 2 + 4 + 1 = 10

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the respondents who were born in a year where the average 'Life satisfaction' for that year was greater than the overall average 'Life satisfaction'.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the overall average 'Life satisfaction' across all respondents. Then, we calculate the average 'Life satisfaction' for each year of birth. Finally, we count the respondents born in years where the average 'Life satisfaction' for that year exceeds the overall average.

1. **Calculate Overall Average 'Life satisfaction':**

To find the overall average 'Life satisfaction', we sum up all 'Life satisfaction' scores and divide by the total number of respondents.

Respondents and their 'Life satisfaction' scores:
- Respondent 21: 5.0
- Respondent 9: 6.0
- Respondent 24: 8.0
- Respondent 104: 8.0
- Respondent 98: 6.0
- Respondent 97: 6.0
- Respondent 142: 7.0
- Respondent 122: 7.0
- Respondent 15: 7.0
- Respondent 3: 6.0

Sum of 'Life satisfaction' = 5.0 + 6.0 + 8.0 + 8.0 + 6.0 + 6.0 + 7.0 + 7.0 + 7.0 + 6.0 = 66.0

Total number of respondents = 10

Overall average 'Life satisfaction' = Sum of 'Life satisfaction' / Total number of respondents = 66.0 / 10 = 6.6

2. **Calculate Average 'Life satisfaction' for Each Year of Birth:**

Years of birth and corresponding 'Life satisfaction' scores:
- 2002: Respondents 9 (6.0), 104 (8.0), 97 (6.0), 15 (7.0)
- 2003: Respondents 21 (5.0), 98 (6.0)
- 2004: Respondents 24 (8.0), 142 (7.0)
- 2005: Respondent 122 (7.0)
- 1998: Respondent 3 (6.0)

Average 'Life satisfaction' for 2002 = (6.0 + 8.0 + 6.0 + 7.0) / 4 = 27.0 / 4 = 6.75
Average 'Life satisfaction' for 2003 = (5.0 + 6.0) / 2 = 11.0 / 2 = 5.5
Average 'Life satisfaction' for 2004 = (8.0 + 7.0) / 2 = 15.0 / 2 = 7.5
Average 'Life satisfaction' for 2005 = 7.0 / 1 = 7.0
Average 'Life satisfaction' for 1998 = 6.0 / 1 = 6.0

3. **Count Respondents Born in Years with Average 'Life satisfaction' Greater Than Overall Average:**

Overall average 'Life satisfaction' = 6.6

Years with average 'Life satisfaction' greater than 6.6:
- 2002: 6.75 (Respondents 9, 104, 97, 15)
- 2004: 7.5 (Respondents 24, 142)
- 2005: 7.0 (Respondent 122)

Count of respondents in these years = 4 (from 2002) + 2 (from 2004) + 1 (from 2005) = 7

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose combined 'Worry' and 'Life satisfaction' score is lower than the average combined 'Worry' and 'Life satisfaction' score for their gender.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average combined 'Worry' and 'Life satisfaction' score for each gender. Then, we compare each respondent's score to the average of their respective gender and count those whose score is lower.

1. **Calculate the average combined 'Worry' and 'Life satisfaction' score for each gender:**

- For males (Gender = 1.0), we sum all 'Worry' and 'Life satisfaction' scores and divide by the number of males.
- For females (Gender = 2.0), we do the same.

2. **Identify the respondents whose combined score is lower than the average for their gender:**

- We will go through each respondent's data, calculate their combined 'Worry' and 'Life satisfaction' score, and compare it to the average score for their gender.

Given the data:

- Males: 
  - Respondent 22: Worry = 2.0, Life satisfaction = 6.0, Combined = 8.0
  - Respondent 128: Worry = 1.0, Life satisfaction = 8.0, Combined = 9.0
  - Respondent 112: Worry = 1.0, Life satisfaction = 5.0, Combined = 6.0
  - Respondent 85: Worry = 1.0, Life satisfaction = 7.0, Combined = 8.0
  - Respondent 11: Worry = 0.0, Life satisfaction = 8.0, Combined = 8.0
- Females:
  - Respondent 145: Worry = 2.0, Life satisfaction = 8.0, Combined = 10.0
  - Respondent 25: Worry = 1.0, Life satisfaction = 8.0, Combined = 9.0
  - Respondent 136: Worry = 1.0, Life satisfaction = 6.0, Combined = 7.0
  - Respondent 59: Worry = 1.0, Life satisfaction = 4.0, Combined = 5.0

**Calculating averages:**

- Male average: (8.0 + 9.0 + 6.0 + 8.0 + 8.0) / 5 = 39.0 / 5 = 7.8
- Female average: (10.0 + 9.0 + 7.0 + 5.0) / 4 = 31.0 / 4 = 7.75

**Comparing each respondent's score to their gender's average:**

- Males:
  - Respondent 22: 8.0 < 7.8 (No)
  - Respondent 128: 9.0 >= 7.8 (No)
  - Respondent 112: 6.0 < 7.8 (Yes)
  - Respondent 85: 8.0 < 7.8 (No)
  - Respondent 11: 8.0 < 7.8 (No)
- Females:
  - Respondent 145: 10.0 >= 7.75 (No)
  - Respondent 25: 9.0 >= 7.75 (No)
  - Respondent 136: 7.0 < 7.75 (Yes)
  - Respondent 59: 5.0 < 7.75 (Yes)

**Counting respondents whose score is lower than their gender's average:**

- Male: 1 (Respondent 112)
- Female: 2 (Respondents 136, 59)

Total count: 1 (Male) + 2 (Females) = 3

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the respondents who were born in a year where the average 'Life satisfaction' for that year was greater than the overall average 'Life satisfaction'.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the overall average 'Life satisfaction' across all respondents. Then, we calculate the average 'Life satisfaction' for each year of birth. Finally, we count the respondents born in years where the average 'Life satisfaction' for that year exceeds the overall average.

1. **Calculate Overall Average 'Life satisfaction':**

From the provided data, we extract the 'Life satisfaction' scores and calculate the average:

- Respondent 146: 7.0
- Respondent 122: 7.0
- Respondent 70: 8.0
- Respondent 12: 6.0
- Respondent 20: 9.0
- Respondent 72: 6.0
- Respondent 140: 3.0
- Respondent 145: 8.0
- Respondent 9: 6.0

Sum of 'Life satisfaction' = 7.0 + 7.0 + 8.0 + 6.0 + 9.0 + 6.0 + 3.0 + 8.0 + 6.0 = 60.0

Number of respondents = 9

Overall average 'Life satisfaction' = Sum of 'Life satisfaction' / Number of respondents = 60.0 / 9 ≈ 6.67

2. **Calculate Average 'Life satisfaction' by Year of Birth:**

- Year 2001: Respondent 140 = 3.0
- Year 2002: Respondents 72 and 9 = (6.0 + 6.0) / 2 = 6.0
- Year 2003: Respondent 20 = 9.0
- Year 2004: Respondents 12 and 70 = (6.0 + 8.0) / 2 = 7.0
- Year 2005: Respondents 146 and 122 = (7.0 + 7.0) / 2 = 7.0
- Year 2022: Respondent 145 = 8.0

3. **Identify Years with Average 'Life satisfaction' Greater Than Overall Average:**

Years with average greater than 6.67 are 2003, 2004, 2005, and 2022.

4. **Count Respondents Born in These Years:**

- 2003: 1 (Respondent 20)
- 2004: 2 (Respondents 12 and 70)
- 2005: 2 (Respondents 146 and 122)
- 2022: 1 (Respondent 145)

Total respondents = 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 6

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total 'Depressive Symptoms' score is higher than the average for their 'Socio-economic status' group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Depressive Symptoms' score for each 'Socio-economic status' group. Then, we compare each respondent's 'Depressive Symptoms' score to the average of their respective 'Socio-economic status' group and count those whose score is higher.

1. **Calculate the total 'Depressive Symptoms' score for each respondent**: This involves summing up the scores for all 'Depressive Symptoms' sub-questions for each respondent.

2. **Determine the 'Socio-economic status' for each respondent**: This is directly given in the responses.

3. **Calculate the average 'Depressive Symptoms' score for each 'Socio-economic status' group**: Group the respondents by their 'Socio-economic status', calculate the total 'Depressive Symptoms' score for each group, and then divide by the number of respondents in each group.

4. **Compare each respondent's 'Depressive Symptoms' score to their group's average and count those with a higher score**.

Given the complexity and the need for precise step-by-step calculations based on the provided data, let's simplify the approach by directly analyzing the given data:

- Respondents and their 'Socio-economic status' and 'Depressive Symptoms' scores need to be individually calculated and then grouped by 'Socio-economic status' to find the average 'Depressive Symptoms' score for each group.

- Due to the format requirements and the complexity of manual calculations for each step without direct computational tools, the explanation will outline the method rather than calculate each step manually.

**Respondents' Data**:

1. **Respondent 81**: Socio-economic status = 3, Depressive Symptoms score = 3+3+3+1+1+0+1 = 12
2. **Respondent 5**: Socio-economic status = 6, Depressive Symptoms score = 1+0+0+0+3+0+0 = 4
3. **Respondent 54**: Socio-economic status = 3, Depressive Symptoms score = 2+2+3+3+1+1+0 = 12
4. **Respondent 37**: Socio-economic status = 5, Depressive Symptoms score = 1+0+1+1+0+1+0 = 4
5. **Respondent 102**: Socio-economic status = 5, Depressive Symptoms score = 0+1+0+1+0+0+0 = 2

**Grouping by Socio-economic status**:

- **Status 3**: Respondents 81, 54, 77, 145. Scores = 12, 12, 4, 7. Average = (12+12+4+7)/4 = 35/4 = 8.75
- **Status 5**: Respondents 37, 102, 42. Scores = 4, 2, 9. Average = (4+2+9)/3 = 15/3 = 5
- **Status 6**: Respondents 5, 20. Scores = 4, 1. Average = (4+1)/2 = 5/2 = 2.5

**Comparing Scores to Group Averages**:

- **Status 3**: Only scores higher than 8.75 are considered. None of the respondents have a score higher than 8.75 except for none because all are either below or exactly at the average when considering the actual calculation should reflect the comparison accurately.
- **Status 5**: Only scores higher than 5 are considered. Respondent 42 has a score of 9, which is higher than the average.
- **Status 6**: Only scores higher than 2.5 are considered. Respondent 5 has a score of 4, which is higher than the average.

**Counting Respondents with Higher Scores than Their Group Average**:

Based on the calculations and comparisons, the respondents with scores higher than their group's average are:

- Respondent 42 (Socio-economic status 5)

You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the respondents whose combined 'Life satisfaction' and 'Depression' score is lower than the average combined 'Life satisfaction' and 'Depression' score for their gender.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average combined 'Life satisfaction' and 'Depression' score for each gender. Then, we compare each respondent's score to the average of their respective gender and count those whose score is lower.

1. **Calculate the average combined score for each gender:**

- For males (Gender = 1.0), we sum all 'Life satisfaction' and 'Depression' scores and divide by the number of males.
- For females (Gender = 2.0), we do the same.

2. **Identify respondents whose combined score is lower than their gender's average:**

- We go through each respondent, calculate their combined 'Life satisfaction' and 'Depression' score, and compare it to the average combined score of their gender.
- If the respondent's score is lower, we count them.

**Step 1: Calculate averages**

Males:
- Respondent 100: Life satisfaction = 8.0, Depression = 1.0, Combined = 9.0
- Respondent 85: Life satisfaction = 7.0, Depression = 0.0, Combined = 7.0
- Respondent 99: Life satisfaction = 5.0, Depression = 1.0, Combined = 6.0
- Respondent 89: Life satisfaction = 9.0, Depression = 0.0, Combined = 9.0
- Respondent 129: Life satisfaction = 7.0, Depression = 1.0, Combined = 8.0

Total combined score for males = 9.0 + 7.0 + 6.0 + 9.0 + 8.0 = 39.0
Number of males = 5
Average combined score for males = 39.0 / 5 = 7.8

Females:
- Respondent 146: Life satisfaction = 7.0, Depression = 2.0, Combined = 9.0
- Respondent 139: Life satisfaction = 6.0, Depression = 3.0, Combined = 9.0
- Respondent 36: Life satisfaction = 7.0, Depression = 0.0, Combined = 7.0
- Respondent 21: Life satisfaction = 5.0, Depression = 3.0, Combined = 8.0

Total combined score for females = 9.0 + 9.0 + 7.0 + 8.0 = 33.0
Number of females = 4
Average combined score for females = 33.0 / 4 = 8.25

**Step 2: Identify and count respondents**

Males:
- Respondent 100: 9.0 (not lower than 7.8)
- Respondent 85: 7.0 (lower than 7.8)
- Respondent 99: 6.0 (lower than 7.8)
- Respondent 89: 9.0 (not lower than 7.8)
- Respondent 129: 8.0 (not lower than 7.8)

Females:
- Respondent 146: 9.0 (not lower than 8.25)
- Respondent 139: 9.0 (not lower than 8.25)
- Respondent 36: 7.0 (lower than 8.25)
- Respondent 21: 8.0 (lower than 8.25)

**Count of respondents whose combined score is lower than their gender's average:**

Males: 2 (Respondents 85 and 99)
Females: 2 (Respondents 36 and 21)

Total count = 2 (males) + 2 (females) = 4

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the respondents who were born in a year where the average 'Life satisfaction' for that year was greater than the overall average 'Life satisfaction'.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the overall average 'Life satisfaction' across all respondents. Then, we calculate the average 'Life satisfaction' for each year of birth. Finally, we count the respondents born in years where the average 'Life satisfaction' for that year exceeds the overall average.

1. **Calculate the overall average 'Life satisfaction':**

From the provided data, we extract the 'Life satisfaction' scores:
- Respondent 26: 4.0
- Respondent 112: 5.0
- Respondent 60: 8.0
- Respondent 20: 9.0
- Respondent 88: 7.0
- Respondent 102: 7.0
- Respondent 84: 9.0
- Respondent 8: 8.0

Sum of 'Life satisfaction' scores = 4.0 + 5.0 + 8.0 + 9.0 + 7.0 + 7.0 + 9.0 + 8.0 = 57.0

Number of respondents = 8

Overall average 'Life satisfaction' = Sum of 'Life satisfaction' scores / Number of respondents = 57.0 / 8 = 7.125

2. **Calculate the average 'Life satisfaction' for each year of birth and identify years with above-average satisfaction:**

- Year 2000: Respondent 60 = 8.0
- Year 2001: Respondents 112 and 88 = (5.0 + 7.0) / 2 = 6.0
- Year 2002: Respondents 102 and 84 = (7.0 + 9.0) / 2 = 8.0
- Year 2003: Respondents 20 and 8 = (9.0 + 8.0) / 2 = 8.5
- Year 2004: Respondent 26 = 4.0

Years with average 'Life satisfaction' greater than the overall average (7.125):
- 2000: 8.0
- 2002: 8.0
- 2003: 8.5

3. **Count the respondents born in these years:**

- 2000: 1 (Respondent 60)
- 2002: 2 (Respondents 102 and 84)
- 2003: 2 (Respondents 20 and 8)

Total respondents = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$",True
