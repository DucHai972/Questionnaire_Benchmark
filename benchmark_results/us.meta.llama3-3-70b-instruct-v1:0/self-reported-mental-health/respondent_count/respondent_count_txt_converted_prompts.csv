<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who are male.
</task>","To count the respondents who are male, we refer to the 'questions' section and find that the gender question is a multiple-choice question (MCQ) with options ""1. Male"" and ""2. Female"". We then look at the 'responses' section and count the number of respondents who answered ""1.0"" to the gender question, as this corresponds to ""Male"" according to the schema.

From the provided responses:
- Respondent 106: Gender: 1.0
- Respondent 85: Gender: 1.0
- Respondent 121: Gender: 1.0

These are the respondents who are male. Therefore, the count of male respondents is 4, but based on the provided data, we only see 4 respondents with gender specified as ""1.0"" which indicates male, but there might be an oversight in the count based on the visible data. However, strictly following the provided data and instructions:

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who are female.
</task>","To determine the count of female respondents, we refer to the 'questions' section, which defines the gender question as ""[MCQ: 1. Male 2. Female]"". This means that a response of ""1"" corresponds to ""Male"" and a response of ""2"" corresponds to ""Female"".

Looking through the 'responses' section:

- Respondent 147: Gender = 2.0 (Female)
- Respondent 60: Gender = 1.0 (Male)
- Respondent 137: Gender = 1.0 (Male)
- Respondent 10: Gender = 1.0 (Male)
- Respondent 45: Gender = 1.0 (Male)
- Respondent 107: Gender = 1.0 (Male)

Only Respondent 147 has a gender response that corresponds to ""Female"".

The final answer is: 1",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who are male.
</task>","To count the respondents who are male, we refer to the 'questions' section, which defines the gender question as ""[MCQ: 1. Male 2. Female]"". This means that a response of ""1.0"" corresponds to ""Male"" and a response of ""2.0"" corresponds to ""Female"".

From the 'responses' section, we identify the respondents who answered ""1.0"" to the gender question:

- Respondent 104: Gender: 1.0
- Respondent 129: Gender: 1.0
- Respondent 80: Gender: 1.0
- Respondent 76: Gender: 1.0
- Respondent 57: Gender: 1.0
- Respondent 40: Gender: 1.0
- Respondent 95: Gender: 1.0

There are 7 respondents who are male. 

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who are male.
</task>","To count the respondents who are male, we refer to the 'questions' section, which defines the gender question as ""[MCQ: 1. Male 2. Female]"". This means that a response of ""1.0"" corresponds to ""Male"" and a response of ""2.0"" corresponds to ""Female"".

From the 'responses' section, we identify the respondents who answered ""1.0"" to the gender question:

- Respondent 84: Gender: 1.0
- Respondent 114: Gender: 1.0
- Respondent 30: Gender: 1.0
- Respondent 150: Gender: 1.0

Therefore, the number of respondents who are male is 4.",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who are male.
</task>","To count the respondents who are male, we refer to the 'questions' section and find that the gender question is a multiple-choice question (MCQ) with options ""1. Male"" and ""2. Female"". We then look at the 'responses' section and count the number of respondents who answered ""1.0"" to the gender question, as this corresponds to ""Male"" according to the schema.

From the provided responses:
- Respondent 15: Gender: 1.0
- Respondent 117: Gender: 1.0
- Respondent 34: Gender: 1.0
- Respondent 107: Gender: 1.0

There are 4 respondents who identified as male.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the male respondents whose mother has more than 10 years of education and whose 'Life satisfaction' is 7 or higher.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to analyze the 'responses' section based on the 'questions' schema provided.

1. Identify male respondents: According to the schema, Gender is coded as 1 for Male and 2 for Female. So, we are looking for respondents with Gender: 1.0.

2. Mother has more than 10 years of education: This information is found under Parental Education, specifically Mother. We need to find respondents where Mother's education is greater than 10 years.

3. 'Life satisfaction' is 7 or higher: Life satisfaction scores range from 0 to 10, and we are interested in those with a score of 7 or more.

Let's examine the respondents based on these criteria:

- Respondent 57: Male, Mother's education is not provided, Life satisfaction is 8.0. Does not meet the criteria because Mother's education is not specified.
- Respondent 106: Male, Mother's education is 17.0 years, Life satisfaction is 5.0. Does not meet the criteria because Life satisfaction is less than 7.
- Respondent 77: Male, Mother's education is not provided, Life satisfaction is 7.0. Does not meet the criteria because Mother's education is not specified.
- Respondent 16: Male, Mother's education is not provided, Life satisfaction is 9.0. Does not meet the criteria because Mother's education is not specified.
- Respondent 143: Male, Mother's education is not provided, Life satisfaction is 8.0. Does not meet the criteria because Mother's education is not specified.

Only Respondent 106 has both the gender and parental education information provided, but does not meet the life satisfaction criterion. None of the other male respondents have their mother's education specified, so they cannot be counted based on the given criteria.

Therefore, the count of male respondents whose mother has more than 10 years of education and whose 'Life satisfaction' is 7 or higher is 0, since none of the respondents meet all the specified conditions.",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Depression' and 'Worry' is exactly 15.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to examine each respondent's scores for 'Depression' and 'Worry' and count those whose total score for these two questions is exactly 15.

Let's calculate the total score for 'Depression' and 'Worry' for each respondent:

1. Respondent 110: Depression = 0, Worry = 1, Total = 1
2. Respondent 143: Depression = 2, Worry = 1, Total = 3
3. Respondent 127: Depression = 0, Worry = 1, Total = 1
4. Respondent 13: Depression = 1, Worry = 0, Total = 1
5. Respondent 89: Depression = 0, Worry = 2, Total = 2
6. Respondent 98: Depression = 0, Worry = 1, Total = 1
7. Respondent 135: Depression = 0, Worry = 1, Total = 1

None of the respondents have a total score of exactly 15 for 'Depression' and 'Worry'.

- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</task>","To solve this task, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the male respondents.
2. Filter those whose mother has more than 10 years of education.
3. Further filter those with a 'Life satisfaction' score of 6 or higher.

From the provided data:

- Respondent 107: Male, Mother's education = 6.0 years, Life satisfaction = 6.0
- Respondent 105: Male, Mother's education = 11.0 years, Life satisfaction = 7.0
- Respondent 39: Male, No data on Mother's education, Life satisfaction = 9.0
- Respondent 77: Male, No data on Mother's education, Life satisfaction = 7.0
- Respondent 97: Male, No data on Mother's education, Life satisfaction = 6.0
- Respondent 138: Male, Mother's education = 12.0 years, Life satisfaction = 6.0
- Respondent 58: Male, No data on Mother's education, Life satisfaction = 7.0

Given the criteria:
- Respondent 105 fits because he is male, his mother has more than 10 years of education, and his life satisfaction is 7.0, which is 6 or higher.
- Respondent 138 fits because he is male, his mother has more than 10 years of education, and his life satisfaction is 6.0.

Therefore, the count of male respondents whose mother has more than 10 years of education and whose 'Life satisfaction' is 6 or higher is 2.",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents born in 2004 who have a 'Stress' greater than 5 and a 'Depression' less than 3.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to examine each respondent's data for the year of birth, Stress, and Depression levels.

1. **Year of Birth**: We are looking for respondents born in 2004.
2. **Stress**: The Stress level should be greater than 5.
3. **Depression**: The Depression level should be less than 3.

Let's analyze the provided data:

- Respondent 37: Born in 2004, Stress = 3, Depression = 1. Does not meet the Stress criterion.
- Respondent 119: Born in 2002, so does not meet the year of birth criterion.
- Respondent 15: Born in 2002, so does not meet the year of birth criterion.
- Respondent 144: Born in 2004, Stress = 4, Depression = 2. Does not meet the Stress criterion.
- Respondent 106: Born in 2002, so does not meet the year of birth criterion.
- Respondent 107: Born in 2001, so does not meet the year of birth criterion.
- Respondent 143: Born in 2005, so does not meet the year of birth criterion.
- Respondent 136: Born in 2005, so does not meet the year of birth criterion.
- Respondent 35: Born in 2001, so does not meet the year of birth criterion.
- Respondent 100: Born in 1999, so does not meet the year of birth criterion.

None of the respondents meet all the specified criteria (born in 2004, Stress > 5, and Depression < 3). 

The final answer is: $\boxed{0}$",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Loneliness' and 'Happiness' is exactly 10.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to examine each respondent's scores for 'Loneliness' and 'Happiness' and count those whose total score for these two metrics equals exactly 10.

1. Respondent 86: Loneliness = 10, Happiness = 5, Total = 15
2. Respondent 78: Loneliness = 0, Happiness = 7, Total = 7
3. Respondent 4: Loneliness = 0, Happiness = 9, Total = 9
4. Respondent 55: Loneliness = 0, Happiness = 8, Total = 8
5. Respondent 49: Loneliness = 9, Happiness = 0, Total = 9
6. Respondent 31: Loneliness = 5, Happiness = 6, Total = 11
7. Respondent 123: Loneliness = 0, Happiness = 6, Total = 6
8. Respondent 63: Loneliness = 0, Happiness = 8, Total = 8
9. Respondent 53: Loneliness = 10, Happiness = 5, Total = 15

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents born in 2004 who have a 'Loneliness' greater than 6 and a 'Depression' less than 3.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to carefully examine the 'responses' section of the data provided and apply the filters as specified in the task.

1. **Year of birth is 2004**: We look for respondents with a 'Year of birth' value of 2004.0.
2. **'Loneliness' greater than 6**: We then filter these respondents further to only include those with a 'Loneliness' score greater than 6.
3. **'Depression' less than 3**: Finally, from this subset, we only consider respondents with a 'Depression' score less than 3.

Let's apply these filters to the data:

- Respondent 26: Born in 2004, Loneliness = 3 (does not meet the criteria of Loneliness > 6), Depression = 2 (meets the criteria).
- Respondent 53: Born in 2004, Loneliness = 10 (meets the criteria of Loneliness > 6), Depression = 2 (meets the criteria).
- Respondent 81: Born in 2002 (does not meet the birth year criteria), so we exclude this respondent.
- Respondent 12: Born in 2004, Loneliness = 0 (does not meet the criteria of Loneliness > 6), Depression = 0 (meets the criteria but does not meet the Loneliness criteria).
- Respondent 145: Born in 2022 (does not meet the birth year criteria), so we exclude this respondent.
- Respondent 57: Born in 2004, Loneliness = 0 (does not meet the criteria of Loneliness > 6), Depression = 0 (meets the criteria but does not meet the Loneliness criteria).

From the provided data, only **Respondent 53** meets all the specified criteria (born in 2004, Loneliness > 6, and Depression < 3).

Therefore, the count of respondents who meet these criteria is **1**.",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the female respondents whose mother has more than 10 years of education and whose 'Life satisfaction' is 7 or higher.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the female respondents.
2. Among the female respondents, find those whose mother has more than 10 years of education.
3. Among those found in step 2, count the ones whose 'Life satisfaction' is 7 or higher.

From the provided data:

- Respondent 59: Female, Mother's education = 9.0, Life satisfaction = 4.0
- Respondent 98: Female, Mother's education data not available, Life satisfaction = 6.0
- Respondent 146: Female, Mother's education = 9.0, Life satisfaction = 7.0
- Respondent 63: Male, 
- Respondent 128: Male, 
- Respondent 141: Female, Mother's education data not available, Life satisfaction = 8.0
- Respondent 87: Male, 
- Respondent 66: Male, 
- Respondent 126: Male, 
- Respondent 118: Female, Mother's education = 11.0, Life satisfaction = 6.0

Correcting the above based on actual gender identification from the data:
- Respondent 59: Gender = 2.0 (Female), Mother's education = 9.0, Life satisfaction = 4.0
- Respondent 98: Gender = 2.0 (Female), Mother's education data not available, Life satisfaction = 6.0
- Respondent 146: Gender = 2.0 (Female), Mother's education = 9.0, Life satisfaction = 7.0
- Respondent 63: Gender = 1.0 (Male), 
- Respondent 128: Gender = 1.0 (Male), 
- Respondent 141: Gender = 2.0 (Female), Mother's education data not available, Life satisfaction = 8.0
- Respondent 87: Gender = 1.0 (Male), 
- Respondent 66: Gender = 1.0 (Male), 
- Respondent 126: Gender = 1.0 (Male), 
- Respondent 118: Gender = 2.0 (Female), Mother's education = 11.0, Life satisfaction = 6.0

Thus, the female respondents with more than 10 years of mother's education and life satisfaction of 7 or higher are:
- Respondent 141 (if we had the mother's education, but it's not available)
- Respondent 146 does not meet the education criterion since the mother's education is 9 years.
- Respondent 118 does meet the education criterion but not the life satisfaction criterion since it's 6.0.

However, upon reevaluation for accuracy in following instructions:
- The actual task is to count female respondents whose mother has more than 10 years of education and whose 'Life satisfaction' is 7 or higher.
- Respondent 118 is a female with a mother's education of 11 years but has a life satisfaction of 6.0, which does not meet the criteria.
- Respondent 146 is a female with a life satisfaction of 7.0 but her mother's education is 9 years, which does not meet the education criterion.

Given the strict criteria and correcting my analysis path:
- Only Respondent 141 could potentially fit if her mother's education was known and over 10 years, but since that specific data is missing, we cannot count her based on the information given.

Therefore, based on the provided data and adhering strictly to the criteria:
The final answer is: $\boxed{0}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose combined 'Depression' and 'Stress' score is lower than the average combined 'Depression' and 'Stress' score for their gender.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average combined 'Depression' and 'Stress' score for each gender. Then, we compare each respondent's combined score to the average for their gender and count those whose score is lower.

1. **Calculate the average combined 'Depression' and 'Stress' score for each gender:**

- For males (Gender: 1.0), we sum the 'Depression' and 'Stress' scores and then divide by the number of males.
- For females (Gender: 2.0), we do the same.

2. **Identify the respondents and their scores:**

Respondent 56: Female, Depression: 1.0, Stress: 4.0  
Respondent 130: Male, Depression: 0.0, Stress: 2.0  
Respondent 117: Male, Depression: 0.0, Stress: 3.0  
Respondent 96: Male, Depression: 0.0, Stress: 3.0  
Respondent 16: Male, Depression: 0.0, Stress: 1.0  
Respondent 124: Male, Depression: 0.0, Stress: 2.0  
Respondent 125: Male, Depression: 1.0, Stress: 2.0  
Respondent 5: Female, Depression: 0.0, Stress: 3.0  

3. **Calculate the average combined 'Depression' and 'Stress' score for males:**

Combined scores for males:  
- Respondent 130: 0.0 + 2.0 = 2.0  
- Respondent 117: 0.0 + 3.0 = 3.0  
- Respondent 96: 0.0 + 3.0 = 3.0  
- Respondent 16: 0.0 + 1.0 = 1.0  
- Respondent 124: 0.0 + 2.0 = 2.0  
- Respondent 125: 1.0 + 2.0 = 3.0  

Total combined score for males = 2.0 + 3.0 + 3.0 + 1.0 + 2.0 + 3.0 = 14.0  
Number of males = 6  
Average for males = 14.0 / 6 = 2.3333...

4. **Calculate the average combined 'Depression' and 'Stress' score for females:**

Combined scores for females:  
- Respondent 56: 1.0 + 4.0 = 5.0  
- Respondent 5: 0.0 + 3.0 = 3.0  

Total combined score for females = 5.0 + 3.0 = 8.0  
Number of females = 2  
Average for females = 8.0 / 2 = 4.0

5. **Count the respondents whose combined score is lower than the average for their gender:**

For males (average = 2.3333...):  
- Respondent 130: 2.0 (lower)  
- Respondent 16: 1.0 (lower)  
- Respondent 124: 2.0 (lower)  

For females (average = 4.0):  
- Respondent 5: 3.0 (lower)  

Count of respondents with a lower combined score than the average for their gender: 4

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose 'Worry' is higher than the average 'Worry' for their gender.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Worry' score for each gender and then compare each respondent's 'Worry' score to the average for their gender.

From the 'questions' section, we understand that 'Gender' is a MCQ with 1. Male and 2. Female, and 'Worry' is a Likert scale from 0 to 10.

Let's calculate the average 'Worry' for each gender based on the provided responses:

1. Male respondents and their 'Worry' scores:
   - Respondent 137: 1.0
   - Respondent 106: 3.0
   - Respondent 4: 0.0
   - Respondent 138: 1.0

   Total Worry for Male = 1.0 + 3.0 + 0.0 + 1.0 = 5.0
   Number of Male respondents = 4
   Average Worry for Male = Total Worry for Male / Number of Male respondents = 5.0 / 4 = 1.25

2. Female respondents and their 'Worry' scores:
   - Respondent 142: 3.0
   - Respondent 5: 2.0
   - Respondent 136: 1.0
   - Respondent 71: 1.0

   Total Worry for Female = 3.0 + 2.0 + 1.0 + 1.0 = 7.0
   Number of Female respondents = 4
   Average Worry for Female = Total Worry for Female / Number of Female respondents = 7.0 / 4 = 1.75

Now, let's identify the respondents whose 'Worry' is higher than the average 'Worry' for their gender:

- Male respondents with 'Worry' higher than 1.25:
  - Respondent 106: 3.0 (higher than 1.25)

- Female respondents with 'Worry' higher than 1.75:
  - Respondent 142: 3.0 (higher than 1.75)

Count of respondents whose 'Worry' is higher than the average 'Worry' for their gender = 2

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose 'Stress' is higher than the average 'Stress' for their gender.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Stress' for each gender and then compare each respondent's 'Stress' level to this average based on their gender.

From the 'questions' section, we understand that 'Gender' is coded as 1 for Male and 2 for Female, and 'Stress' is measured on a scale of 0 to 10.

Let's calculate the average 'Stress' for each gender:

1. **Male (Gender = 1)**:
   - Respondent 129: Stress = 3
   - Respondent 111: Stress = 2
   - Respondent 28: Stress = 1
   - Respondent 135: Stress = 3
   - Respondent 39: Stress = 1
   - Total Stress for Males = 3 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 1 = 10
   - Number of Males = 5
   - Average Stress for Males = Total Stress for Males / Number of Males = 10 / 5 = 2

2. **Female (Gender = 2)**:
   - Respondent 5: Stress = 3
   - Respondent 46: Stress = 4
   - Respondent 25: Stress = 1
   - Respondent 62: Stress = 4
   - Respondent 50: Stress = 3
   - Total Stress for Females = 3 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 3 = 15
   - Number of Females = 5
   - Average Stress for Females = Total Stress for Females / Number of Females = 15 / 5 = 3

Now, let's identify the respondents whose 'Stress' is higher than the average 'Stress' for their gender:

- **Males** with Stress higher than 2:
  - None of the males have a stress level higher than the average male stress of 2, since the highest stress level among males is exactly 3, which is higher than 2. So, we include all males with a stress level of 3: Respondent 129, Respondent 135.

- **Females** with Stress higher than 3:
  - Respondent 46: Stress = 4
  - Respondent 62: Stress = 4

Thus, the respondents whose 'Stress' is higher than the average 'Stress' for their gender are:
- Respondent 129
- Respondent 135
- Respondent 46
- Respondent 62

Count of such respondents = 4",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who were born in a year where the average 'Life satisfaction' for that year was greater than the overall average 'Life satisfaction'.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the overall average 'Life satisfaction' across all respondents. Then, for each year of birth, we calculate the average 'Life satisfaction' and compare it to the overall average. Finally, we count the respondents born in years where the average 'Life satisfaction' for that year exceeds the overall average.

1. **Calculate Overall Average 'Life satisfaction':**

   - Respondent 135: 10.0
   - Respondent 65: 8.0
   - Respondent 91: 8.0
   - Respondent 69: 4.0
   - Respondent 102: 7.0
   - Respondent 21: 5.0
   - Respondent 96: 10.0
   - Respondent 104: 8.0
   - Respondent 118: 6.0
   - Respondent 145: 8.0
   - Respondent 63: 8.0
   - Respondent 58: 7.0

   Overall average = (10.0 + 8.0 + 8.0 + 4.0 + 7.0 + 5.0 + 10.0 + 8.0 + 6.0 + 8.0 + 8.0 + 7.0) / 12
   Overall average = 84.0 / 12
   Overall average = 7.0

2. **Group Respondents by Year of Birth and Calculate Average 'Life satisfaction' for Each Year:**

   - 1993: Respondent 135 (10.0)
   - 2002: Respondents 102 (7.0), 104 (8.0)
   - 2003: Respondents 69 (4.0), 21 (5.0)
   - 2004: Respondents 63 (8.0), 58 (7.0)
   - 2005: Respondents 65 (8.0), 91 (8.0), 96 (10.0), 118 (6.0)
   - 2022: Respondent 145 (8.0)

   - Average for 1993: 10.0
   - Average for 2002: (7.0 + 8.0) / 2 = 15.0 / 2 = 7.5
   - Average for 2003: (4.0 + 5.0) / 2 = 9.0 / 2 = 4.5
   - Average for 2004: (8.0 + 7.0) / 2 = 15.0 / 2 = 7.5
   - Average for 2005: (8.0 + 8.0 + 10.0 + 6.0) / 4 = 32.0 / 4 = 8.0
   - Average for 2022: 8.0

3. **Identify Years with Average 'Life satisfaction' Greater Than Overall Average (7.0):**

   - 1993: 10.0 > 7.0
   - 2002: 7.5 > 7.0
   - 2004: 7.5 > 7.0
   - 2005: 8.0 > 7.0
   - 2022: 8.0 > 7.0

4. **Count Respondents in Identified Years:**

   - 1993: 1 (Respondent 135)
   - 2002: 2 (Respondents 102, 104)
   - 2004: 2 (Respondents 63, 58)
   - 2005: 4 (Respondents 65, 91, 96, 118)
   - 2022: 1 (Respondent 145)

   Total count = 1 + 2 + 2 + 4 + 1 = 10

The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who were born in a year where the average 'Life satisfaction' for that year was greater than the overall average 'Life satisfaction'.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the overall average 'Life satisfaction' across all respondents. Then, we calculate the average 'Life satisfaction' for each year of birth. Finally, we count the respondents born in years where the average 'Life satisfaction' for that year exceeds the overall average.

1. **Calculate overall average 'Life satisfaction':**

Respondent 21: Life satisfaction = 5.0  
Respondent 9: Life satisfaction = 6.0  
Respondent 24: Life satisfaction = 8.0  
Respondent 104: Life satisfaction = 8.0  
Respondent 98: Life satisfaction = 6.0  
Respondent 97: Life satisfaction = 6.0  
Respondent 142: Life satisfaction = 7.0  
Respondent 122: Life satisfaction = 7.0  
Respondent 15: Life satisfaction = 7.0  
Respondent 3: Life satisfaction = 6.0  

Sum of Life satisfaction = 5.0 + 6.0 + 8.0 + 8.0 + 6.0 + 6.0 + 7.0 + 7.0 + 7.0 + 6.0 = 66.0  
Number of respondents = 10  
Overall average Life satisfaction = Sum of Life satisfaction / Number of respondents = 66.0 / 10 = 6.6

2. **Calculate average 'Life satisfaction' for each year of birth and compare:**

- **Year 2002:**  
  Respondent 9: Life satisfaction = 6.0  
  Respondent 104: Life satisfaction = 8.0  
  Respondent 97: Life satisfaction = 6.0  
  Respondent 15: Life satisfaction = 7.0  
  Sum for 2002 = 6.0 + 8.0 + 6.0 + 7.0 = 27.0  
  Number of respondents for 2002 = 4  
  Average for 2002 = 27.0 / 4 = 6.75  
  Since 6.75 > 6.6, respondents from 2002 qualify.

- **Year 2003:**  
  Respondent 21: Life satisfaction = 5.0  
  Respondent 98: Life satisfaction = 6.0  
  Sum for 2003 = 5.0 + 6.0 = 11.0  
  Number of respondents for 2003 = 2  
  Average for 2003 = 11.0 / 2 = 5.5  
  Since 5.5 < 6.6, respondents from 2003 do not qualify.

- **Year 2004:**  
  Respondent 24: Life satisfaction = 8.0  
  Respondent 142: Life satisfaction = 7.0  
  Sum for 2004 = 8.0 + 7.0 = 15.0  
  Number of respondents for 2004 = 2  
  Average for 2004 = 15.0 / 2 = 7.5  
  Since 7.5 > 6.6, respondents from 2004 qualify.

- **Year 2005:**  
  Respondent 122: Life satisfaction = 7.0  
  Sum for 2005 = 7.0  
  Number of respondents for 2005 = 1  
  Average for 2005 = 7.0  
  Since 7.0 > 6.6, the respondent from 2005 qualifies.

- **Year 1998:**  
  Respondent 3: Life satisfaction = 6.0  
  Sum for 1998 = 6.0  
  Number of respondents for 1998 = 1  
  Average for 1998 = 6.0  
  Since 6.0 < 6.6, the respondent from 1998 does not qualify.

3. **Count the respondents who qualify:**

From 2002: 4 respondents (9, 104, 97, 15)  
From 2004: 2 respondents (24, 142)  
From 2005: 1 respondent (122)  

Total respondents who qualify = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose combined 'Worry' and 'Life satisfaction' score is lower than the average combined 'Worry' and 'Life satisfaction' score for their gender.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average combined 'Worry' and 'Life satisfaction' score for each gender. Then, we compare each respondent's score to the average of their respective gender and count those whose score is lower.

1. **Calculate the average combined 'Worry' and 'Life satisfaction' score for each gender:**

- For males (Gender: 1.0), the respondents are 22, 128, 112, 85, and 11.
  - Respondent 22: Worry (2.0) + Life satisfaction (6.0) = 8.0
  - Respondent 128: Worry (1.0) + Life satisfaction (8.0) = 9.0
  - Respondent 112: Worry (1.0) + Life satisfaction (5.0) = 6.0
  - Respondent 85: Worry (1.0) + Life satisfaction (7.0) = 8.0
  - Respondent 11: Worry (0.0) + Life satisfaction (8.0) = 8.0
  - Average for males = (8.0 + 9.0 + 6.0 + 8.0 + 8.0) / 5 = 39.0 / 5 = 7.8

- For females (Gender: 2.0), the respondents are 145, 25, 136, and 59.
  - Respondent 145: Worry (2.0) + Life satisfaction (8.0) = 10.0
  - Respondent 25: Worry (1.0) + Life satisfaction (8.0) = 9.0
  - Respondent 136: Worry (1.0) + Life satisfaction (6.0) = 7.0
  - Respondent 59: Worry (1.0) + Life satisfaction (4.0) = 5.0
  - Average for females = (10.0 + 9.0 + 7.0 + 5.0) / 4 = 31.0 / 4 = 7.75

2. **Compare each respondent's score to the average of their respective gender and count those whose score is lower:**

- Males:
  - Respondent 22: 8.0 (lower than 7.8 is false)
  - Respondent 128: 9.0 (lower than 7.8 is false)
  - Respondent 112: 6.0 (lower than 7.8 is true)
  - Respondent 85: 8.0 (lower than 7.8 is false)
  - Respondent 11: 8.0 (lower than 7.8 is false)
  - Count for males = 1

- Females:
  - Respondent 145: 10.0 (lower than 7.75 is false)
  - Respondent 25: 9.0 (lower than 7.75 is false)
  - Respondent 136: 7.0 (lower than 7.75 is true)
  - Respondent 59: 5.0 (lower than 7.75 is true)
  - Count for females = 2

3. **Total count of respondents whose combined score is lower than the average for their gender:**

Total count = Count for males + Count for females = 1 + 2 = 3

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who were born in a year where the average 'Life satisfaction' for that year was greater than the overall average 'Life satisfaction'.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the overall average 'Life satisfaction' across all respondents. Then, we calculate the average 'Life satisfaction' for each year of birth. Finally, we count the respondents born in years where the average 'Life satisfaction' for that year exceeds the overall average.

1. **Calculate overall average 'Life satisfaction':**

Respondent 146: Life satisfaction = 7.0
Respondent 122: Life satisfaction = 7.0
Respondent 70: Life satisfaction = 8.0
Respondent 12: Life satisfaction = 6.0
Respondent 20: Life satisfaction = 9.0
Respondent 72: Life satisfaction = 6.0
Respondent 140: Life satisfaction = 3.0
Respondent 145: Life satisfaction = 8.0
Respondent 9: Life satisfaction = 6.0

Sum of Life satisfaction = 7.0 + 7.0 + 8.0 + 6.0 + 9.0 + 6.0 + 3.0 + 8.0 + 6.0 = 60.0

Number of respondents = 9

Overall average Life satisfaction = Sum of Life satisfaction / Number of respondents = 60.0 / 9 ≈ 6.67

2. **Calculate average 'Life satisfaction' for each year of birth and compare:**

- Year 2001: Respondent 140, Life satisfaction = 3.0
- Year 2002: Respondents 72, 9; Life satisfaction = 6.0 + 6.0 = 12.0; Average = 12.0 / 2 = 6.0
- Year 2003: Respondent 20, Life satisfaction = 9.0
- Year 2004: Respondents 70, 12; Life satisfaction = 8.0 + 6.0 = 14.0; Average = 14.0 / 2 = 7.0
- Year 2005: Respondents 146, 122; Life satisfaction = 7.0 + 7.0 = 14.0; Average = 14.0 / 2 = 7.0
- Year 2022: Respondent 145, Life satisfaction = 8.0

Years with average Life satisfaction greater than the overall average (6.67):
- 2003 (9.0)
- 2004 (7.0)
- 2005 (7.0)
- 2022 (8.0)

Respondents in these years:
- 2003: Respondent 20
- 2004: Respondents 70, 12
- 2005: Respondents 146, 122
- 2022: Respondent 145

Total respondents = 1 (2003) + 2 (2004) + 2 (2005) + 1 (2022) = 6

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total 'Depressive Symptoms' score is higher than the average for their 'Socio-economic status' group.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Depressive Symptoms' score for each 'Socio-economic status' group. Then, we compare each respondent's 'Depressive Symptoms' score to the average of their respective 'Socio-economic status' group and count those whose score is higher.

1. **Calculate the total 'Depressive Symptoms' score for each respondent:**
   - This involves summing up the scores for 'Anhedonia', 'Depressed Mood', 'Sleep Problems', 'Fatigue', 'Appetite Changes', 'Feelings of Worthlessness', 'Concentration Difficulties', 'Psychomotor Changes', and 'Suicidal Thoughts' for each respondent.

2. **Determine the 'Socio-economic status' group for each respondent:**
   - The 'Socio-economic status' is given on a scale of 1 to 6.

3. **Calculate the average 'Depressive Symptoms' score for each 'Socio-economic status' group:**
   - Group the respondents by their 'Socio-economic status'.
   - For each group, calculate the average 'Depressive Symptoms' score.

4. **Compare each respondent's 'Depressive Symptoms' score to their group's average and count those with a higher score:**
   - For each respondent, check if their 'Depressive Symptoms' score is higher than the average score of their 'Socio-economic status' group.
   - Count the respondents who meet this condition.

Given the complexity and the need for precise step-by-step calculations based on the provided data, let's proceed with the analysis:

### Step 1: Calculate Total 'Depressive Symptoms' Score for Each Respondent

- Respondent 81: 3 (Anhedonia) + 3 (Sleep Problems) + 3 (Fatigue) + 1 (Appetite Changes) + 1 (Feelings of Worthlessness) + 0 (Concentration Difficulties) + 0 (not provided for Psychomotor Changes) + 1 (Suicidal Thoughts) = 12
- Respondent 5: 1 (Anhedonia) + 0 (Sleep Problems) + 0 (Fatigue) + 0 (Appetite Changes) + 3 (Feelings of Worthlessness) + 0 (Concentration Difficulties) + 0 (not provided for Psychomotor Changes) + 0 (Suicidal Thoughts) = 4
- Respondent 54: 2 (Anhedonia) + 2 (Sleep Problems) + 3 (Fatigue) + 3 (Appetite Changes) + 1 (Feelings of Worthlessness) + 1 (Concentration Difficulties) + 0 (not provided for Psychomotor Changes) + 0 (Suicidal Thoughts) = 12
- Respondent 37: 1 (Anhedonia) + 0 (Sleep Problems) + 1 (Fatigue) + 1 (Appetite Changes) + 0 (Feelings of Worthlessness) + 1 (Concentration Difficulties) + 0 (not provided for Psychomotor Changes) + 0 (Suicidal Thoughts) = 4
- Respondent 102: 0 (Anhedonia) + 1 (Sleep Problems) + 0 (Fatigue) + 1 (Appetite Changes) + 0 (Feelings of Worthlessness) + 0 (Concentration Difficulties) + 0 (not provided for Psychomotor Changes) + 0 (Suicidal Thoughts) = 2

### Step 2: Determine 'Socio-economic status' Group

- Respondent 81: Socio-economic status = 3
- Respondent 5: Socio-economic status = 6
- Respondent 54: Socio-economic status = 3
- Respondent 37: Socio-economic status = 5
- Respondent 102: Socio-economic status = 5
- Respondent 20: Socio-economic status = 6
- Respondent 77: Socio-economic status = 3
- Respondent 42: Socio-economic status = 5
- Respondent 145: Socio-economic status = 3

### Step 3: Calculate Average 'Depressive Symptoms' Score for Each 'Socio-economic status' Group

- **Socio-economic status 3:** (12 + 12 + 4) / 4 = 28 / 4 = 7
- **Socio-economic status 5:** (4 + 2 + 9) / 3 = 15 / 3 = 5
- **Socio-economic status 6:** (4 + 1) / 2 = 5 / 2 = 2.5

### Step 4: Compare and Count

- **Socio-economic status 3:** 
  - Respondent 81: 12 > 7 (Yes)
  - Respondent 54: 12 > 7 (Yes)
  - Respondent 77: 4 < 7 (No)
  - Respondent 145: 7 = 7 (No)
- **Socio-economic status 5:** 
  - Respondent 37: 4 < 5 (No)
  - Respondent 102: 2 < 5 (No)
  - Respondent 42: 9 > 5 (Yes)
- **Socio-economic status 6:** 
  - Respondent 5: 4 > 2.5 (Yes)
  - Respondent 20: 1 < 2.5 (No)

Count of respondents with a higher 'Depressive Symptoms' score than their group's average: 4 (Respondents 81, 54, 42, 5)

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose combined 'Life satisfaction' and 'Depression' score is lower than the average combined 'Life satisfaction' and 'Depression' score for their gender.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average combined 'Life satisfaction' and 'Depression' score for each gender. Then, we compare each respondent's score to the average of their respective gender and count those whose score is lower.

1. Calculate the average combined 'Life satisfaction' and 'Depression' score for males and females.

Males:
- Respondent 100: Life satisfaction = 8, Depression = 1, Combined = 9
- Respondent 85: Life satisfaction = 7, Depression = 0, Combined = 7
- Respondent 99: Life satisfaction = 5, Depression = 1, Combined = 6
- Respondent 89: Life satisfaction = 9, Depression = 0, Combined = 9
- Respondent 129: Life satisfaction = 7, Depression = 1, Combined = 8

Total combined score for males = 9 + 7 + 6 + 9 + 8 = 39
Number of males = 5
Average for males = 39 / 5 = 7.8

Females:
- Respondent 146: Life satisfaction = 7, Depression = 2, Combined = 9
- Respondent 139: Life satisfaction = 6, Depression = 3, Combined = 9
- Respondent 36: Life satisfaction = 7, Depression = 0, Combined = 7
- Respondent 21: Life satisfaction = 5, Depression = 3, Combined = 8

Total combined score for females = 9 + 9 + 7 + 8 = 33
Number of females = 4
Average for females = 33 / 4 = 8.25

2. Compare each respondent's combined score to the average of their gender and count those whose score is lower.

Males:
- Respondent 100: 9 (not lower than 7.8)
- Respondent 85: 7 (lower than 7.8)
- Respondent 99: 6 (lower than 7.8)
- Respondent 89: 9 (not lower than 7.8)
- Respondent 129: 8 (lower than 7.8)

Females:
- Respondent 146: 9 (not lower than 8.25)
- Respondent 139: 9 (not lower than 8.25)
- Respondent 36: 7 (lower than 8.25)
- Respondent 21: 8 (lower than 8.25)

Count of respondents with a combined score lower than the average for their gender:
- Males: 3 (Respondents 85, 99, 129)
- Females: 2 (Respondents 36, 21)

Total count = 3 + 2 = 5

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the respondents who were born in a year where the average 'Life satisfaction' for that year was greater than the overall average 'Life satisfaction'.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the overall average 'Life satisfaction' across all respondents. Then, we calculate the average 'Life satisfaction' for each year of birth. Finally, we count the respondents born in years where the average 'Life satisfaction' for that year exceeds the overall average.

1. **Calculate overall average 'Life satisfaction':**

Respondent 26: Life satisfaction = 4.0  
Respondent 112: Life satisfaction = 5.0  
Respondent 60: Life satisfaction = 8.0  
Respondent 20: Life satisfaction = 9.0  
Respondent 88: Life satisfaction = 7.0  
Respondent 102: Life satisfaction = 7.0  
Respondent 84: Life satisfaction = 9.0  
Respondent 8: Life satisfaction = 8.0  

Overall average Life satisfaction = (4.0 + 5.0 + 8.0 + 9.0 + 7.0 + 7.0 + 9.0 + 8.0) / 8 = 58.0 / 8 = 7.25

2. **Calculate average 'Life satisfaction' for each year of birth and identify years with above-average satisfaction:**

- Year 2000: Respondent 60, Life satisfaction = 8.0  
- Year 2001: Respondents 112, 88, Life satisfaction = (5.0 + 7.0) / 2 = 6.0  
- Year 2002: Respondents 102, 84, Life satisfaction = (7.0 + 9.0) / 2 = 8.0  
- Year 2003: Respondents 20, 8, Life satisfaction = (9.0 + 8.0) / 2 = 8.5  
- Year 2004: Respondent 26, Life satisfaction = 4.0  

Years with average Life satisfaction greater than the overall average (7.25) are 2000, 2002, and 2003.

3. **Count respondents born in these years:**

- Year 2000: 1 respondent (60)  
- Year 2002: 2 respondents (102, 84)  
- Year 2003: 2 respondents (20, 8)  

Total respondents = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$",True
