<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>

Male"" and ""2. Female"". We will count the number of respondents who answered ""1.0"" (since the responses are given as numbers, not letters), which corresponds to ""Male"".

From the provided responses:
- Respondent 117: Gender = 1.0 (Male)
- Respondent 130: Gender = 1.0 (Male)
- Respondent 111: Gender = 1.0 (Male)

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the respondents with a Depression of 8 or higher.
</task>","To answer this question, we need to examine the 'responses' section of the data and look for the ""Depression"" field for each respondent. According to the schema, ""Depression"" is measured on a Likert scale of 0-10, where 0 = 'At no time' and 10 = 'All the time'. We are interested in counting respondents who reported a depression level of 8 or higher.

Let's go through the responses:

1. Respondent 87 - Depression: 1.0 (less than 8)
2. Respondent 117 - Depression: 0.0 (less than 8)
3. Respondent 103 - Depression: 0.0 (less than 8)
4. Respondent 107 - Depression: 1.0 (less than 8)
5. Respondent 25 - Depression: 0.0 (less than 8)
6. Respondent 81 - Depression: 2.0 (less than 8)
7. Respondent 110 - Depression: 0.0 (less than 8)
8. Respondent 66 - Depression: 0.0 (less than 8)
9. Respondent 96 - Depression: 0.0 (less than 8)
10. Respondent 40 - Depression: 3.0 (less than 8)

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents are female?
</task>","To determine the number of female respondents, we need to look at the ""Gender"" field in the responses. According to the schema, the ""Gender"" field is a multiple-choice question with options ""1. Male"" and ""2. Female"". We will count the number of respondents who answered ""2.0"" (since the responses are given as numbers, not letters) for their gender.

After reviewing the responses:
- Respondent 14: Gender = 2.0 (Female)
- Respondent 74: Gender = 1.0 (Male)
- Respondent 80: Gender = 1.0 (Male)
- Respondent 91: Gender = 1.0 (Male)
- Respondent 27: Gender = 2.0 (Female)
- Respondent 148: Gender = 1.0 (Male)
- Respondent 130: Gender = 1.0 (Male)
- Respondent 55: Gender = 1.0 (Male)
- Respondent 40: Gender = 1.0 (Male)
- Respondent 124: Gender = 1.0 (Male)
- Respondent 58: Gender = 1.0 (Male)

There are 2 respondents who are female (Respondent 14 and Respondent 27).

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

How many respondents born in 2003 have a Worry greater than 4 and a Laughter less than 6?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to examine each respondent's data for the year of birth, Worry, and Laughter levels.

From the provided data:

- Respondent 87: Year of birth = 2003, Worry = 2, Laughter = 6. Does not meet the criteria because Worry is not greater than 4 and Laughter is not less than 6.
- Respondent 47: Year of birth = 2003, Worry = 1, Laughter = 5. Does not meet the criteria because Worry is not greater than 4.
- Respondent 8: Year of birth = 2003, Worry = 2, Laughter = 7. Does not meet the criteria because Worry is not greater than 4 and Laughter is not less than 6.

None of the respondents born in 2003 have a Worry greater than 4 and a Laughter less than 6.

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many female respondents have a mother with more than 17 years of education and a 'Life satisfaction' score of 8 or higher?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to examine each respondent's data and check if they meet the specified criteria: being female, having a mother with more than 17 years of education, and having a 'Life satisfaction' score of 8 or higher.

From the provided responses:

1. Respondent 136: Female, Mother's education = 5.0 years, Life satisfaction = 6.0. Does not meet the criteria.
2. Respondent 56: Female, Mother's education = 17.0 years, Life satisfaction = 7.0. Does not meet the criteria because the mother's education is exactly 17 years, not more than 17 years.
3. Respondent 97: Male, so does not meet the gender criterion.
4. Respondent 108: Female, but Mother's education is not specified, Life satisfaction = 4.0. Does not meet the criteria.
5. Respondent 117: Male, so does not meet the gender criterion.
6. Respondent 88: Male, so does not meet the gender criterion.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Happiness' and 'Stress' is exactly 4.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to go through each respondent's data and calculate the total score for 'Happiness' and 'Stress'. We are looking for respondents where this total score equals exactly 4.

Let's calculate this for each respondent:

### Respondent 13
- **Happiness:** 6.0
- **Stress:** 2.0
Total = 6.0 + 2.0 = 8.0 (Does not meet the criteria)

### Respondent 21
- **Happiness:** 1.0
- **Stress:** 3.0
Total = 1.0 + 3.0 = 4.0 (Meets the criteria)

### Respondent 70
- **Happiness:** 8.0
- **Stress:** 3.0
Total = 8.0 + 3.0 = 11.0 (Does not meet the criteria)

### Respondent 114
- **Happiness:** 5.0
- **Stress:** 2.0
Total = 5.0 + 2.0 = 7.0 (Does not meet the criteria)

### Respondent 109
- **Happiness:** 0.0
- **Stress:** 4.0
Total = 0.0 + 4.0 = 4.0 (Meets the criteria)

### Respondent 125
- **Happiness:** 8.0
- **Stress:** 2.0
Total = 8.0 + 2.0 = 10.0 (Does not meet the criteria)

### Respondent 107
- **Happiness:** 5.0
- **Stress:** 3.0
Total = 5.0 + 3.0 = 8.0 (Does not meet the criteria)

From the given data, only Respondent 21 and Respondent 109 have a total score for 'Happiness' and 'Stress' that equals exactly 4.

Therefore, the count of respondents whose total score for 'Happiness' and 'Stress' is exactly 4 is 2.",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

</task>","To answer this question, we need to analyze the 'responses' section of the data and identify the female respondents who have a mother with more than 18 years of education and a 'Life satisfaction' score of 7 or higher.

From the 'responses' section, we can see that:

- Respondent 15 has a mother with 16 years of education, which is less than 18 years.
- Respondent 2 has a mother with 11 years of education, which is less than 18 years.
- Respondent 53 has a mother with 5 years of education, which is less than 18 years.
- Respondent 78 has a mother with 25 years of education, which is more than 18 years. Respondent 78 is female and has a 'Life satisfaction' score of 9, which is 7 or higher.
- Respondent 36 does not have parental education information.
- Respondent 55 does not have parental education information.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>

</task>","To solve this task, we need to examine each respondent's data for 'Happiness' and 'Depression' scores, add these two scores together, and then count how many respondents have a total score of exactly 8.

Let's go through the respondents one by one:

1. Respondent 75: Happiness = 9, Depression = 1. Total = 10.
2. Respondent 84: Happiness = 8, Depression = 0. Total = 8.
3. Respondent 31: Happiness = 6, Depression = 3. Total = 9.
4. Respondent 2: Happiness = 7, Depression = 0. Total = 7.
5. Respondent 128: Happiness = 8, Depression = 0. Total = 8.
6. Respondent 111: Happiness = 8, Depression = 0. Total = 8.
7. Respondent 45: Happiness = 9, Depression = 1. Total = 10.
8. Respondent 34: Happiness = 10, Depression = 0. Total = 10.
9. Respondent 98: Happiness = 5, Depression = 0. Total = 5.
10. Respondent 137: Happiness = 7, Depression = 1. Total = 8.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many male respondents have a mother with more than 16 years of education and a 'Life satisfaction' score of 6 or higher?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to analyze the 'responses' section of the data and identify the male respondents who have a mother with more than 16 years of education and a 'Life satisfaction' score of 6 or higher.

From the data, we can see that the following respondents meet the criteria:

- Respondent 84: Male, mother's education = 16 years, Life satisfaction = 9
- Respondent 103: Female, mother's education = 19 years, Life satisfaction = 7
- Respondent 44: Female, mother's education = 17 years, Life satisfaction = 6
- Respondent 23: Male, mother's education = 25 years, Life satisfaction = 6

However, only the male respondents with a mother's education of more than 16 years and a Life satisfaction score of 6 or higher should be counted. 

Thus, the male respondents that meet the criteria are:

- Respondent 84 does not meet the criteria because the mother's education is exactly 16 years, not more than 16 years.
- Respondent 23 meets the criteria.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents whose total score for 'Worry' and 'Enjoyment' is exactly 10.
</task>","To solve this task, we need to examine each respondent's data for the 'Worry' and 'Enjoyment' scores, add these two scores together, and then count how many respondents have a total score of exactly 10.

Let's go through the respondents one by one:

1. Respondent 136: Worry = 1, Enjoyment = 5, Total = 6
2. Respondent 131: Worry = 2, Enjoyment = 6, Total = 8
3. Respondent 50: Worry = 1, Enjoyment = 9, Total = 10
4. Respondent 90: Worry = 2, Enjoyment = 4, Total = 6
5. Respondent 38: Worry = 0, Enjoyment = 5, Total = 5
6. Respondent 61: Worry = 2, Enjoyment = 10, Total = 12
7. Respondent 27: Worry = 2, Enjoyment = 10, Total = 12
8. Respondent 66: Worry = 1, Enjoyment = 5, Total = 6

From the given data, only Respondent 50 has a total score of exactly 10 for 'Worry' and 'Enjoyment'.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
How many female respondents have a mother with more than 18 years of education and a 'Life satisfaction' score of 6 or higher?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to analyze the 'responses' section of the data and identify the female respondents who have a mother with more than 18 years of education and a 'Life satisfaction' score of 6 or higher.

From the 'questions' section, we know that the 'Gender' field is a MCQ with options 1. Male and 2. Female. We are interested in female respondents, so we will look for respondents with a 'Gender' value of 2.0.

We also know that the 'Parental Education' field has subfields for 'Father' and 'Mother', and we are interested in respondents whose mother has more than 18 years of education.

Finally, we know that the 'Life satisfaction' field is a Likert scale with values from 0 to 10, and we are interested in respondents with a score of 6 or higher.

With this information, we can analyze the 'responses' section and identify the female respondents who meet these criteria.

Respondent 20 has a 'Gender' of 1.0 (Male), so this respondent does not meet the criteria.

Respondent 40 has a 'Gender' of 1.0 (Male), so this respondent does not meet the criteria.

Respondent 46 has a 'Gender' of 2.0 (Female) and a 'Mother' education of 16.0, which is less than 18 years. This respondent does not meet the criteria.

Respondent 127 has a 'Gender' of 2.0 (Female) and a 'Mother' education of 27.0, which is more than 18 years. This respondent's 'Life satisfaction' score is 8.0, which is 6 or higher. This respondent meets the criteria.

Respondent 119 has a 'Gender' of 2.0 (Female) and a 'Mother' education of 11.0, which is less than 18 years. This respondent does not meet the criteria.

Respondent 145 has a 'Gender' of 2.0 (Female) and a 'Mother' education of 15.0, which is less than 18 years. This respondent does not meet the criteria.

Respondent 149 has a 'Gender' of 1.0 (Male), so this respondent does not meet the criteria.

Respondent 115 has a 'Gender' of 2.0 (Female) and a 'Mother' education of 28.0, which is more than 18 years. This respondent's 'Life satisfaction' score is 7.0, which is 6 or higher. This respondent meets the criteria.

Therefore, there are 2 female respondents who have a mother with more than 18 years of education and a 'Life satisfaction' score of 6 or higher: Respondent 127 and Respondent 115.

The final answer is: $\boxed{2}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
How many respondents born in 2005 have a Loneliness greater than 5 and a Happiness less than 4?
</task>","To answer this question, we need to examine each respondent's data for the year of birth, loneliness, and happiness levels.

From the provided data:

- Respondent 39 was born in 2005, had a loneliness of 9.0, and happiness of 8.0. This respondent does not meet the happiness criterion.
- Respondent 71 was born in 2005, had a loneliness of 8.0, and happiness of 5.0. This respondent meets the loneliness criterion but not the happiness criterion since happiness is exactly 5, not less than 4, and also because the question asks for happiness less than 4.
- Respondent 91 was born in 2005, had a loneliness of 8.0, and happiness of 7.0. This respondent does not meet the happiness criterion.
- Respondent 121 was born in 2005, had a loneliness of 4.0, and happiness of 7.0. This respondent does not meet the loneliness criterion.
- Respondent 130 was born in 2002, so this respondent does not meet the year of birth criterion.

Therefore, none of the respondents born in 2005 have a loneliness greater than 5 and a happiness less than 4 based on the provided data.

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
How many respondents have a Life satisfaction that is higher than the average Life satisfaction for their gender?
</task>","To solve this, we first need to calculate the average Life satisfaction for each gender and then compare each respondent's Life satisfaction to the average of their respective gender.

From the data provided:

- Male respondents (Gender: 1.0) and their Life satisfaction scores are:
  - Respondent 80: 8.0
  - Respondent 116: 6.0
  - Respondent 10: 8.0
  - Respondent 15: 7.0
  - Respondent 74: 3.0
  - Respondent 20: 9.0
  - Respondent 95: 8.0

- Female respondents (Gender: 2.0) and their Life satisfaction scores are:
  - Respondent 119: 8.0

Calculating the average Life satisfaction for males:
(8.0 + 6.0 + 8.0 + 7.0 + 3.0 + 9.0 + 8.0) / 7 = 49.0 / 7 = 7.0

Calculating the average Life satisfaction for females:
Since there's only one female respondent, her score is the average: 8.0

Now, comparing each respondent's Life satisfaction to the average of their gender:

- Males:
  - Respondent 80: 8.0 (equal to the average)
  - Respondent 116: 6.0 (lower than the average)
  - Respondent 10: 8.0 (equal to the average)
  - Respondent 15: 7.0 (lower than the average)
  - Respondent 74: 3.0 (lower than the average)
  - Respondent 20: 9.0 (higher than the average)
  - Respondent 95: 8.0 (equal to the average)

- Females:
  - Respondent 119: 8.0 (equal to the average, but since she is the only one, there's no higher or lower in this context)

From the comparison, only Respondent 20 has a Life satisfaction higher than the average for their gender.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
How many respondents have a Happiness that is higher than the average Happiness for their gender?
</task>","To solve this, we first need to calculate the average Happiness for each gender, then compare each respondent's Happiness to this average, and finally count how many respondents have a higher Happiness than their gender's average.

## Step 1: Calculate the average Happiness for each gender
We need to separate the respondents by gender and calculate the average Happiness for each group.

- For Gender 1.0 (Male):
  - Respondent 130: Happiness = 8.0
  - Respondent 99: Happiness = 2.0
  - Respondent 119: Happiness = 7.0 (Gender 2.0, not included)
  - Respondent 149: Happiness = 9.0
  - Respondent 142: Happiness = 5.0 (Gender 2.0, not included)
  - Respondent 11: Happiness = 5.0
  - Respondent 116: Happiness = 6.0
  - Respondent 147: Happiness = 9.0 (Gender 2.0, not included)
  - Total Male Happiness = 8.0 + 2.0 + 9.0 + 5.0 + 6.0 = 30.0
  - Number of Males = 5
  - Average Male Happiness = 30.0 / 5 = 6.0

- For Gender 2.0 (Female):
  - Respondent 119: Happiness = 7.0
  - Respondent 142: Happiness = 5.0
  - Respondent 147: Happiness = 9.0
  - Total Female Happiness = 7.0 + 5.0 + 9.0 = 21.0
  - Number of Females = 3
  - Average Female Happiness = 21.0 / 3 = 7.0

## Step 2: Compare each respondent's Happiness to their gender's average and count those higher
Now, we compare each respondent's Happiness to the average for their gender and count those with higher Happiness.

- Male Respondents:
  - Respondent 130: 8.0 > 6.0, count = 1
  - Respondent 99: 2.0 < 6.0
  - Respondent 149: 9.0 > 6.0, count = 2
  - Respondent 11: 5.0 < 6.0
  - Respondent 116: 6.0 = 6.0 (not higher)
  - Total Males with higher Happiness = 2

- Female Respondents:
  - Respondent 119: 7.0 = 7.0 (not higher)
  - Respondent 142: 5.0 < 7.0
  - Respondent 147: 9.0 > 7.0, count = 1
  - Total Females with higher Happiness = 1

## Step 3: Sum the counts for both genders
Total respondents with higher Happiness than their gender's average = Total Males with higher Happiness + Total Females with higher Happiness = 2 + 1 = 3

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have a total 'Depressive Symptoms' score that is higher than the average for their 'Socio-economic status' group?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Depressive Symptoms' score for each 'Socio-economic status' group. Then, we compare each respondent's 'Depressive Symptoms' score to the average of their respective 'Socio-economic status' group to determine how many have a score higher than the average.

Given the complexity and the amount of data provided, let's break down the steps:

1. **Calculate Total 'Depressive Symptoms' Score for Each Respondent:**
   - For each respondent, sum up all the scores under 'Depressive Symptoms Frequency'.

2. **Group Respondents by 'Socio-economic status':**
   - Collect all respondents with the same 'Socio-economic status' into groups (e.g., all with status 3.0, all with status 4.0, etc.).

3. **Calculate Average 'Depressive Symptoms' Score for Each 'Socio-economic status' Group:**
   - For each group, calculate the average total 'Depressive Symptoms' score.

4. **Compare Each Respondent's Score to Their Group's Average:**
   - For each respondent, check if their total 'Depressive Symptoms' score is higher than the average score of their 'Socio-economic status' group.

5. **Count Respondents with Scores Higher Than Their Group's Average:**
   - Count how many respondents have a total 'Depressive Symptoms' score higher than the average of their respective 'Socio-economic status' group.

Let's execute these steps with the provided data:

### Step 1 & 2: Calculate and Group

- **Respondent 83:** Socio-economic status = 3.0, Depressive Symptoms = 1+0+2+2+2+1+0 = 8
- **Respondent 122:** Socio-economic status = 3.0, Depressive Symptoms = 1+0+2+1+0+1+0 = 5
- **Respondent 129:** Socio-economic status = 5.0, Depressive Symptoms = 0+2+1+0+0+0+0 = 3
- **Respondent 39:** Socio-economic status = 4.0, Depressive Symptoms = 1+0+0+2+0+2+0 = 5
- **Respondent 16:** Socio-economic status = 2.0, Depressive Symptoms = 1+2+2+0+0+2+0 = 7
- **Respondent 116:** Socio-economic status = 3.0, Depressive Symptoms = 1+1+1+0+0+1+0 = 4
- **Respondent 27:** Socio-economic status = 2.0, Depressive Symptoms = 1+0+1+0+3+0+0 = 5
- **Respondent 88:** Socio-economic status = 4.0, Depressive Symptoms = 0+0+1+3+0+0+0 = 4
- **Respondent 22:** Socio-economic status = 3.0, Depressive Symptoms = 2+1+3+2+1+3+0 = 12

### Step 3: Calculate Averages

- **Socio-economic status 2.0:** Average = (7 + 5) / 2 = 6
- **Socio-economic status 3.0:** Average = (8 + 5 + 4 + 12) / 4 = 29 / 4 = 7.25
- **Socio-economic status 4.0:** Average = (5 + 4) / 2 = 4.5
- **Socio-economic status 5.0:** Average = 3 (only one respondent)

### Step 4 & 5: Compare and Count

- **Socio-economic status 2.0:**
  - Respondent 16: 7 (higher than 6)
  - Respondent 27: 5 (lower than 6)
  - Count: 1
- **Socio-economic status 3.0:**
  - Respondent 83: 8 (higher than 7.25)
  - Respondent 122: 5 (lower than 7.25)
  - Respondent 116: 4 (lower than 7.25)
  - Respondent 22: 12 (higher than 7.25)
  - Count: 2
- **Socio-economic status 4.0:**
  - Respondent 39: 5 (higher than 4.5)
  - Respondent 88: 4 (lower than 4.5)
  - Count: 1
- **Socio-economic status 5.0:**
  - Since there's only one respondent, there's no average to compare to, so we don't count this group.

Total count of respondents with scores higher than their group's average = 1 (from status 2.0) + 2 (from status 3.0) + 1 (from status 4.0) = 4

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who were born in a year where the average 'Life satisfaction' for that year was greater than the overall average 'Life satisfaction'.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the overall average 'Life satisfaction' across all respondents. Then, we calculate the average 'Life satisfaction' for each year of birth. Finally, we count the respondents born in years where the average 'Life satisfaction' for that year exceeds the overall average.

1. **Calculate Overall Average 'Life satisfaction':**

From the provided data, we sum up all 'Life satisfaction' scores and divide by the total number of respondents.

- Respondent 11: 8.0
- Respondent 64: 7.0
- Respondent 113: 7.0
- Respondent 135: 10.0
- Respondent 134: 4.0
- Respondent 41: 8.0
- Respondent 94: 8.0
- Respondent 96: 10.0
- Respondent 73: 8.0
- Respondent 100: 8.0
- Respondent 105: 7.0

Total 'Life satisfaction' = 10.0 + 8.0 + 7.0 + 7.0 + 10.0 + 4.0 + 8.0 + 8.0 + 10.0 + 8.0 + 8.0 + 7.0 = 96.0

Total respondents = 12

Overall average 'Life satisfaction' = Total 'Life satisfaction' / Total respondents = 96.0 / 12 = 8.0

2. **Calculate Average 'Life satisfaction' for Each Year of Birth:**

- 1993: Respondent 135 = 10.0 (1 respondent)
- 1998: Respondent 11 = 8.0 (1 respondent)
- 1999: Respondent 100 = 8.0 (1 respondent)
- 2001: Respondent 94 = 8.0 (1 respondent)
- 2002: Respondents 45, 113, 105 = 10.0 + 7.0 + 7.0 = 24.0 (3 respondents)
- 2003: Respondents 134, 41, 73 = 4.0 + 8.0 + 8.0 = 20.0 (3 respondents)
- 2005: Respondents 64, 96 = 7.0 + 10.0 = 17.0 (2 respondents)

Average for 1993 = 10.0
Average for 1998 = 8.0
Average for 1999 = 8.0
Average for 2001 = 8.0
Average for 2002 = 24.0 / 3 = 8.0
Average for 2003 = 20.0 / 3 = 6.67
Average for 2005 = 17.0 / 2 = 8.5

3. **Count Respondents Born in Years with Average 'Life satisfaction' Greater Than Overall Average:**

Overall average 'Life satisfaction' = 8.0

Years with average 'Life satisfaction' greater than 8.0 are 1993 and 2005.

- 1993: 1 respondent
- 2005: 2 respondents

Total respondents in these years = 1 + 2 = 3

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$",False

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who were born in a year where the average 'Life satisfaction' for that year was greater than the overall average 'Life satisfaction'.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the overall average 'Life satisfaction' across all respondents. Then, we calculate the average 'Life satisfaction' for each year of birth. Finally, we count the respondents born in years where the average 'Life satisfaction' for that year exceeds the overall average.

1. **Calculate Overall Average 'Life satisfaction':**

   - Respondent 14: 3.0
   - Respondent 86: 8.0
   - Respondent 17: 10.0
   - Respondent 85: 7.0
   - Respondent 25: 8.0
   - Respondent 143: 8.0
   - Respondent 99: 5.0
   - Respondent 73: 8.0
   - Respondent 65: 8.0
   - Respondent 39: 9.0

   Overall average = (3.0 + 8.0 + 10.0 + 7.0 + 8.0 + 8.0 + 5.0 + 8.0 + 8.0 + 9.0) / 10 = 78.0 / 10 = 7.8

2. **Calculate Average 'Life satisfaction' by Year of Birth:**

   - 2001: (8.0 + 5.0) / 2 = 13.0 / 2 = 6.5
   - 2002: (3.0) / 1 = 3.0
   - 2003: (7.0 + 8.0) / 2 = 15.0 / 2 = 7.5
   - 2004: (8.0) / 1 = 8.0
   - 2005: (8.0 + 9.0 + 8.0) / 3 = 25.0 / 3 = 8.33

3. **Identify Years with Average 'Life satisfaction' Greater than Overall Average (7.8):**

   - 2003: 7.5 (does not exceed 7.8)
   - 2004: 8.0 (exceeds 7.8)
   - 2005: 8.33 (exceeds 7.8)

4. **Count Respondents Born in Identified Years:**

   - 2004: Respondent 86 (1 respondent)
   - 2005: Respondents 143, 65, 39 (3 respondents)

Total respondents = 1 (2004) + 3 (2005) = 4

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have a Loneliness that is higher than the average Loneliness for their gender?
</task>","To solve this, we first need to calculate the average loneliness for each gender and then compare each respondent's loneliness score to the average for their gender.

## Step 1: Calculate the average loneliness for each gender
We need to separate the respondents by gender and calculate the average loneliness for each group.

- For Gender 1.0 (Male):
  - Respondent 21: Loneliness = 10.0
  - Respondent 150: Loneliness = 6.0
  - Respondent 90: Loneliness = 8.0
  - Respondent 80: Loneliness = 2.0
  - Respondent 101: Loneliness = 2.0
  - Respondent 34: Loneliness = 0.0
  - Respondent 97: Loneliness = 10.0
  - Average Male Loneliness = (10 + 6 + 8 + 2 + 2 + 0 + 10) / 7 = 38 / 7 = 5.43 (rounded to two decimal places)

- For Gender 2.0 (Female):
  - Respondent 37: Loneliness = 3.0
  - Respondent 22: Loneliness = 0.0
  - Respondent 144: Loneliness = 6.0
  - Average Female Loneliness = (3 + 0 + 6) / 3 = 9 / 3 = 3.0

## Step 2: Compare each respondent's loneliness to the average for their gender
Now, we compare each respondent's loneliness score to the average for their gender to find out who has a higher loneliness score than the average.

- Male Respondents:
  - Respondent 21: 10.0 > 5.43
  - Respondent 150: 6.0 > 5.43
  - Respondent 90: 8.0 > 5.43
  - Respondent 80: 2.0 < 5.43
  - Respondent 101: 2.0 < 5.43
  - Respondent 34: 0.0 < 5.43
  - Respondent 97: 10.0 > 5.43
  - Males with higher loneliness than average: 4

- Female Respondents:
  - Respondent 37: 3.0 = 3.0
  - Respondent 22: 0.0 < 3.0
  - Respondent 144: 6.0 > 3.0
  - Females with higher loneliness than average: 1

## Step 3: Count the total number of respondents with higher loneliness than the average for their gender
Total respondents with higher loneliness than the average for their gender = Males with higher loneliness + Females with higher loneliness = 4 + 1 = 5

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$",True

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
Count the respondents who were born in a year where the average 'Life satisfaction' for that year was greater than the overall average 'Life satisfaction'.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the overall average 'Life satisfaction' across all respondents. Then, we calculate the average 'Life satisfaction' for each year of birth. Finally, we count the respondents born in years where the average 'Life satisfaction' for that year exceeds the overall average.

1. **Calculate Overall Average 'Life satisfaction':**

From the provided data, we sum up all 'Life satisfaction' scores and divide by the total number of respondents.

- Respondent 33: 5.0
- Respondent 135: 10.0
- Respondent 24: 8.0
- Respondent 109: 9.0
- Respondent 131: 4.0
- Respondent 93: 8.0
- Respondent 5: 5.0
- Respondent 80: 8.0
- Respondent 47: 8.0
- Respondent 55: 10.0

Sum of 'Life satisfaction' = 5.0 + 10.0 + 8.0 + 9.0 + 4.0 + 8.0 + 5.0 + 8.0 + 8.0 + 10.0 = 75.0

Total respondents = 10

Overall average 'Life satisfaction' = Sum of 'Life satisfaction' / Total respondents = 75.0 / 10 = 7.5

2. **Calculate Average 'Life satisfaction' for Each Year of Birth:**

- **2002:** Respondent 80 = 8.0
- **2003:** Respondents 109, 131, 93, 5, 47, 55 = 9.0 + 4.0 + 8.0 + 5.0 + 8.0 + 10.0 = 44.0
  - Average for 2003 = 44.0 / 6 = 7.333...
- **2004:** Respondents 33, 24 = 5.0 + 8.0 = 13.0
  - Average for 2004 = 13.0 / 2 = 6.5
- **1993:** Respondent 135 = 10.0

3. **Count Respondents Born in Years with Average 'Life satisfaction' Greater Than Overall Average:**

The overall average 'Life satisfaction' is 7.5. We look for years with an average greater than 7.5.

- **2003:** Average is 7.333..., which is less than 7.5.
- **2004:** Average is 6.5, which is less than 7.5.
- **1993:** Average is 10.0, which is greater than 7.5.
- **2002:** Average is 8.0, which is greater than 7.5.

Respondents in years with average 'Life satisfaction' greater than the overall average are:
- Respondent 135 (1993)
- Respondent 80 (2002)

Therefore, the count of respondents who were born in a year where the average 'Life satisfaction' for that year was greater than the overall average 'Life satisfaction' is 2.",True

</questionnaire>

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
How many respondents have a total 'Depressive Symptoms' score that is higher than the average for their 'Socio-economic status' group?
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the average 'Depressive Symptoms' score for each 'Socio-economic status' group. Then, we compare each respondent's 'Depressive Symptoms' score to the average of their respective 'Socio-economic status' group to determine how many have a score higher than the average.

Given the complexity and the amount of data provided, let's break down the steps:

1. **Calculate Total 'Depressive Symptoms' Score for Each Respondent:**
   - For each respondent, sum up all the scores under 'Depressive Symptoms Frequency'.

2. **Group Respondents by 'Socio-economic status':**
   - Collect all respondents with the same 'Socio-economic status' into groups.

3. **Calculate Average 'Depressive Symptoms' Score for Each 'Socio-economic status' Group:**
   - For each group, calculate the average total 'Depressive Symptoms' score.

4. **Compare Each Respondent's Score to Their Group's Average:**
   - Count how many respondents have a total 'Depressive Symptoms' score higher than their group's average.

Let's execute these steps with the provided data:

### Step 1: Calculate Total 'Depressive Symptoms' Score for Each Respondent

- Respondent 125: 1 (Anhedonia) + 1 (Sleep Problems) + 1 (Fatigue) + 0 (Appetite Changes) + 1 (Feelings of Worthlessness) + 0 (Concentration Difficulties) + 0 (Suicidal Thoughts) = 4
- Respondent 50: 0 (Anhedonia) + 0 (Sleep Problems) + 0 (Fatigue) + 0 (Appetite Changes) + 1 (Feelings of Worthlessness) + 1 (Concentration Difficulties) + 0 (Suicidal Thoughts) = 2
- Respondent 58: 1 (Anhedonia) + 0 (Sleep Problems) + 1 (Fatigue) + 2 (Appetite Changes) + 0 (Feelings of Worthlessness) + 0 (Concentration Difficulties) + 0 (Suicidal Thoughts) = 4
- Respondent 36: 0 (Anhedonia) + 0 (Sleep Problems) + 1 (Fatigue) + 1 (Appetite Changes) + 0 (Feelings of Worthlessness) + 0 (Concentration Difficulties) + 0 (Suicidal Thoughts) = 2
- Respondent 40: 2 (Anhedonia) + 3 (Sleep Problems) + 2 (Fatigue) + 3 (Appetite Changes) + 1 (Feelings of Worthlessness) + 0 (Concentration Difficulties) + 0 (Suicidal Thoughts) = 11
- Respondent 20: 0 (Anhedonia) + 1 (Sleep Problems) + 0 (Fatigue) + 0 (Appetite Changes) + 0 (Feelings of Worthlessness) + 0 (Concentration Difficulties) + 0 (Suicidal Thoughts) = 1
- Respondent 76: 2 (Anhedonia) + 1 (Sleep Problems) + 1 (Fatigue) + 0 (Appetite Changes) + 1 (Feelings of Worthlessness) + 0 (Concentration Difficulties) + 3 (Suicidal Thoughts) = 8
- Respondent 26: 1 (Anhedonia) + 2 (Sleep Problems) + 2 (Fatigue) + 2 (Appetite Changes) + 2 (Feelings of Worthlessness) + 2 (Concentration Difficulties) + 1 (Suicidal Thoughts) = 12
- Respondent 130: 0 (Anhedonia) + 0 (Sleep Problems) + 0 (Fatigue) + 0 (Appetite Changes) + 0 (Feelings of Worthlessness) + 0 (Concentration Difficulties) + 0 (Suicidal Thoughts) = 0
- Respondent 139: 3 (Anhedonia) + 3 (Sleep Problems) + 2 (Fatigue) + 0 (Appetite Changes) + 0 (Feelings of Worthlessness) + 0 (Concentration Difficulties) + 0 (Suicidal Thoughts) = 8

### Step 2 & 3: Group and Calculate Average

- **Socio-economic status = 1.0**: Respondents 125, 58, 40
  - Total scores: 4 (125) + 4 (58) + 11 (40) = 19
  - Average: 19 / 3 = 6.33
- **Socio-economic status = 2.0**: Respondent 76
  - Total score: 8
  - Average: 8 / 1 = 8
- **Socio-economic status = 3.0**: Respondents 50, 36, 26
  - Total scores: 2 (50) + 2 (36) + 12 (26) = 16
  - Average: 16 / 3 = 5.33
- **Socio-economic status = 5.0**: Respondent 139
  - Total score: 8
  - Average: 8 / 1 = 8
- **Socio-economic status = 6.0**: Respondents 20, 130
  - Total scores: 1 (20) + 0 (130) = 1
  - Average: 1 / 2 = 0.5

### Step 4: Compare Scores

- **Socio-economic status = 1.0**:
  - Respondent 125 (score 4) is below the average.
  - Respondent 58 (score 4) is below the average.
  - Respondent 40 (score 11) is above the average.
- **Socio-economic status = 2.0**:
  - Respondent 76 (score 8) is exactly at the average, so not above.
- **Socio-economic status = 3.0**:
  - Respondent 50 (score 2) is below the average.
  - Respondent 36 (score 2) is below the average.
  - Respondent 26 (score 12) is above the average.
- **Socio-economic status = 5.0**:
  - Respondent 139 (score 8) is exactly at the average, so not above.
- **Socio-economic status = 6.0**:
  - Respondent 20 (score 1) is above the average.
  - Respondent 130 (score 0) is below the average.

Counting the respondents with a score higher than their group's average: Respondent 40, Respondent 26, and Respondent 20.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

</output>

<task>
Count the respondents who were born in a year where the average 'Life satisfaction' for that year was greater than the overall average 'Life satisfaction'.
</task>","To solve this task, we first need to calculate the overall average 'Life satisfaction' across all respondents. Then, we calculate the average 'Life satisfaction' for each year of birth. Finally, we count the respondents born in years where the average 'Life satisfaction' for that year exceeds the overall average.

1. **Calculate Overall Average 'Life satisfaction':**

From the provided data, we extract the 'Life satisfaction' scores:
- Respondent 10: 8.0
- Respondent 87: 7.0
- Respondent 34: 10.0
- Respondent 97: 6.0
- Respondent 40: 8.0
- Respondent 42: 8.0
- Respondent 47: 8.0
- Respondent 43: 7.0
- Respondent 113: 7.0
- Respondent 12: 6.0
- Respondent 106: 5.0
- Respondent 94: 8.0

Sum of 'Life satisfaction' = 8.0 + 7.0 + 10.0 + 6.0 + 8.0 + 8.0 + 8.0 + 7.0 + 7.0 + 6.0 + 5.0 + 8.0 = 88.0

Number of respondents = 12

Overall average 'Life satisfaction' = Sum of 'Life satisfaction' / Number of respondents = 88.0 / 12 ≈ 7.33

2. **Calculate Average 'Life satisfaction' for Each Year of Birth:**

- **2001:** Respondent 94 = 8.0 (Only one respondent, so average is 8.0)
- **2002:** Respondents 10, 97, 113, 106 = 8.0 + 6.0 + 7.0 + 5.0 = 26.0; Average = 26.0 / 4 = 6.5
- **2003:** Respondents 87, 34, 47 = 7.0 + 10.0 + 8.0 = 25.0; Average = 25.0 / 3 ≈ 8.33
- **2004:** Respondents 40, 12 = 8.0 + 6.0 = 14.0; Average = 14.0 / 2 = 7.0
- **2005:** Respondents 42, 43 = 8.0 + 7.0 = 15.0; Average = 15.0 / 2 = 7.5

3. **Count Respondents Born in Years with Average 'Life satisfaction' Greater Than Overall Average (7.33):**

- **2001:** 1 respondent (8.0 > 7.33)
- **2003:** 3 respondents (8.33 > 7.33)
- **2005:** 2 respondents (7.5 > 7.33)

Total respondents = 1 (2001) + 3 (2003) + 2 (2005) = 6

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$",True

<role>
You are a meticulous data analyst AI. Your primary function is to accurately analyze structured data and provide precise, verifiable answers.

</role>

<format>
You will be given a dataset with two key parts:

A 'questions' section: This is your data dictionary or schema. It is the single source of truth for understanding what each field and score means. Refer to it carefully.

A 'responses' section: This contains the raw data from each individual respondent.

To answer the question correctly, you must first use the 'questions' schema to fully understand the context and meaning of the data points within the 'responses'. Do not rely on any prior knowledge outside of this provided data. Base your entire analysis on the information given.

</format>

<output>
Provide your final answer directly and concisely. Output must be the human-readable value, not an option code.

Rules:
- For MCQ fields, map any letter codes in the Responses (case-insensitive) to the corresponding option text from the Questions schema, and output only that text. Do NOT include the letter or both.
  Example: If the schema is ""[MCQ: A. Abnormal B. Inconclusive C. Normal]"" and the response is ""a"", output ""Abnormal"".
- For open-ended fields, output the exact text value.
- If the question asks for a count, provide only the number (e.g., ""42"").
- If the question asks for a list of names or IDs, provide a simple comma-separated list (e.g., ""17, 21, 23"").
- Preserve capitalization exactly as in the schema (e.g., output ""Abnormal"", not ""abnormal"" or ""A"").

<task>
How many respondents have a Anger that is higher than the average Anger for their gender?
</task>","To solve this, we first need to calculate the average Anger for each gender, then compare each respondent's Anger to this average based on their gender.

## Step 1: Calculate the average Anger for each gender
We need to separate the respondents by gender and calculate the average Anger for each group.

- For Gender 1.0 (Male):
  - Respondent 114: Anger = 1.0
  - Respondent 73: Anger = 1.0
  - Respondent 60: Anger = 3.0
  - Respondent 137: Anger = 2.0
  - Respondent 80: Anger = 4.0
  - Respondent 121: Anger = 1.0
  - Average Anger for Males = (1 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 4 + 1) / 6 = 12 / 6 = 2.0
- For Gender 2.0 (Female):
  - Respondent 115: Anger = 3.0
  - Respondent 62: Anger = 4.0
  - Respondent 50: Anger = 2.0
  - Average Anger for Females = (3 + 4 + 2) / 3 = 9 / 3 = 3.0

## Step 2: Compare each respondent's Anger to the average Anger for their gender
Now, we compare each respondent's Anger to the calculated average for their respective gender and count those with Anger higher than the average.

- Males with Anger higher than average (2.0):
  - Respondent 60: Anger = 3.0 (Higher)
  - Respondent 80: Anger = 4.0 (Higher)
  - Count for Males = 2
- Females with Anger higher than average (3.0):
  - Respondent 115: Anger = 3.0 (Equal, not higher)
  - Respondent 62: Anger = 4.0 (Higher)
  - Count for Females = 1

## Step 3: Sum the counts for both genders
Total count of respondents with Anger higher than the average for their gender = Count for Males + Count for Females = 2 + 1 = 3

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$",True
